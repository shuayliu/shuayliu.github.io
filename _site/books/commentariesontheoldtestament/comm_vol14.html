PREFACE</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In preparing the First Volume of the Commentary On
Isaiah, many attempts were made, but without success, to procure the French
Translation. After much fruitless labor, and some expense, a copy of that rare
work, which happens to be in the possession of the Parker Society, has been
kindly lent to the Translator, who takes this opportunity of conveying his
warmest thanks for this favor. The references in the foot-notes of the present
and future Volumes will give some idea of the assistance derived from that
source. But it has also supplied materials for a history, more complete than we
could formerly give, of this Commentary, and of the forms in which it was
successively brought before the public.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Various
scribes, on some occasions, united their efforts to obtain a perfect record of
what had been uttered by the Reformer in his private Lessons, as they were
called, which he delivered to students of theology. But, in the present
instance, we are indebted almost exclusively to the earnest, judicious, and
unwearied labors of one man, <i>Mr. Nicolas Des Galars</i>, a minister of
Geneva, from whose notes, after having been revised by the Author, the first
Latin edition was printed in 1550. He appears to have executed, under the
Author's eye, a French Translation, which came forth almost simultaneously with
the Latin copy, and enjoyed the advantage of being known to be well
authenticated. After the lapse of several years, Calvin availed himself of a
season of leisure for re-writing this Commentary, added more than a third to its
original size,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F260a</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and made such extensive alterations, that he ventured to call it "a new work."
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F260b</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It bears the date of 15th January 1559. The third edition, which is dated 1583,
lays claim to still greater accuracy; for it professes to have received
corrections from the Author's Manuscript.</font><br><font face="Palatino">While
the Commentary was thus extensively circulated,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F260c</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the benefits of it were chiefly confined to those who were acquainted with the
Latin language; for even the French reader was left to struggle with all the
imperfections which belonged to the first edition. At least, it was only eleven
years before the last mentioned date, and eight years after the Author's death,
that a new French translation appeared, which was printed at Geneva by
<i>Francois Perrin</i>, in 1572. There is reason to believe that the first
French translation would be treated by the second translator with great
deference, and that he would scarcely consider himself to be at liberty to
depart from it, except for the purpose of introducing the extensive alterations
and additions which had been made to the original work. Let us hope that some
future editor, having obtained access to copies now slumbering in the shelves of
our continental neighbors, or perhaps of our own countrymen, will enjoy the
satisfaction of collating the earlier and later editions in both languages, and
will be enabled to reveal the steps by which this valuable Commentary passed
from the first rough notes of the labourious scribe to the form which was
imparted to it by the fastidious corrections of the
Author.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This Volume contains an "Address to the
Readers" by <i>Nicolas des</i> <i>Gallars</i>, Latinized <i>Gallasius</i>,
(which appears to have been prefixed to his French translation of the
Commentary,) his Epistolary Dedication of the Latin edition of 1583 to a learned
author and eminent printer, John Crispin, and a short "Address to the Readers"
by the latest French translator, all of which, it is hoped, will be perused with
deep interest. The relation in which <i>Gallars</i> stood to Calvin, and to his
published writings, has thrown around him many pleasing associations; and his
style, both Latin and French, displays such judgment, and taste, and
scholarship, as justifies the marked preference given to him by the Reformer,
and assures the reader that the responsible office which he held could not have
been committed to abler hands.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Notes added
to these Volumes shew that it is the aim of the Calvin Society not only to give
exact Translations, but to aid the investigation of dark passages by the labors
of modern critics. Among the works which have been consulted with greatest
advantage may be named "The Prophecies of Isaiah, Earlier and Later, by
<i>Joseph Addison</i> <i>Alexander</i>, Professor in the Theological Seminary,
Princeton, New Jersey," an exceedingly valuable addition to the stores of
exegetical theology, and not a little enhanced by the care with which the
learned editor, Dr. Eadie, has superintended the British edition. Yet we are
again and again constrained to remark the extent to which the critical
researches of our own age have been anticipated by the sagacity of the Reformer,
to whom our greatest men delight in acknowledging their obligations. "Calvin,"
says Professor Alexander, "still towers above all interpreters in large
commanding views of revelation, in its whole connection, with extraordinary
insight into the logical relations of a passage, even where its individual
expressions were not fully understood. These qualities, together with his fixed
belief of fundamental doctrines, his eminent soundness of judgment, and his
freedom from all tendency to paradox, pedantic affectation, or fanciful conceit,
place him more completely on a level with the very best interpreters of our day
than almost any intervening
writer."</font><br><font face="Palatino">Auchterarder, <i>3d September</i>,

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">PREFATORY
ADVERTISEMENT</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>BY</b></font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">NICOLAS
DES GALLARS</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>TO THE
READERS</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though in collecting these Commentaries I was
astonished, first, at the labor and difficulty, and next at the various opinions
of men, yet I thought, Christian Readers, that I must not refuse to labor or
shrink from anything, provided that I can be of any service. With respect to the
difficulties, I quickly surmounted them, through the clear method of instruction
which the Author has been accustomed to employ, as may be seen in his writings,
but still more in his speaking. And if some obscure passages, of which there are
many in that Prophet, made me pause, it was not because I had not the benefit of
his judgment and advice in clearly explaining and revising the whole; for, in
consequence of the familiar and daily intercourse which I had with him, those
intricacies which might have retarded or perplexed me were easily disentangled
and removed. Besides, at any hour when one could go by stealth, that is, when he
had any relaxation from the weighty affairs which almost overwhelmed him, I read
to him all that I had written, in order that, if he could not closely examine
the whole, he might at least add, or take away, or give me directions, as far as
was necessary. All this he did carefully, though hardly ever did I read to him
two or three verses when he was not immediately called away, either by persons
who wanted his advice, or by his friends. Yet reviewing these things with all
the fidelity and diligence that I could, I still returned, and frequently put
questions to him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As to my labor, it was partly
relieved by some expository remarks which I had collected from his own mouth,
while he was preaching; for it is now four years and more since he explained
that Prophet to us, in a highly profitable manner, in public Discourses, before
giving us the interpretation in the school. At that time, recording not only the
faithful exhortations which relate to the correction of vices, to the condition
of that age, and to the restoration of the purity of doctrine and of the Church,
but also the exact interpretations on which he dwelt largely, in order to draw
from them a solid doctrine to be applied to the use of the people, when I
returned to the house, I wrote them down in Latin, so far as I remembered and
had leisure. That was of great use to me in collecting these Commentaries; not
that I put into them everything that I then wrote, or in the same order and
method, but so far as I already understood the sentiments, and had been
habituated, by some practice, to that mode of interpretation, I had not so much
trouble as if I had come quite raw and ill-prepared to that way of
writing.</font><br><font face="Palatino">So far as relates to the judgments of
men, who must have very various opinions about this labor of mine, I soon
foresaw that there would be many of them who would take no great pleasure in
that which cost me pain, because they would have preferred to have this written
by the Author himself instead of being collected and arranged by me. And indeed
I am very much of their opinion; for the whole would have been sent forth by him
in a more complete and finished state. But as he was employed in preparing other
works, the advantage of which is so evident that it is unnecessary for me to
proclaim it; and as he was harassed by so much business that he scarcely had
leisure to read, it would hardly have been possible for him to put his hand to
that work.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Accordingly, having been for a long
time attached to that Prophet, and wishing clearer expositions of many passages,
and now enjoying them, I thought that I would do what was good and profitable,
if, while I promoted my own benefit, I had regard also to others whose desire
might not be less than mine, and whose minds, even supposing that they had not
so strong a desire, might be aroused by reading this Commentary, and might
receive from it an increase of knowledge. In order, therefore, that you,
believing Reader, might enjoy along with me the explanation of that Prophet, I
suddenly undertook this labor, lest if we waited longer for these Commentaries,
they might be taken from us by some injury or calamity in these wretched times.
For we see every day what snares are laid by Satan for the Church, which is
newly born, and for her faithful teachers. We meet with treachery in some, from
whom we had expected better things; in others we find fickleness and lightness,
and others are blinded by the glimmering of this age. There are very few of them
who, in defense of the kingdom of Christ, oppose the tyrannical laws of
Antichrist.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Let us therefore welcome those who,
through the unspeakable mercy of God, are left to us; or rather let us welcome
the gifts which God has given them, that hereafter, as far as we shall have
opportunity, we may provide for the Church. While we can enjoy their doctrine,
let us seize it eagerly as the armor fitted for repelling our enemies; for there
is great reason to believe that the Lord will take vengeance on the malice of
men by such punishments as they deserve, and will deprive us of the excellent
gifts with which in the present day he has adorned his Church. Many have great
gifts of tongues, while others excel in interpretations, and undoubtedly they
have strong claims on our attention; but this gift of prophecy, which surpasses
all others, and to which we ought to be especially devoted, is generally
despised. Hence it arises that many persons are more addicted to ostentation
than eager to promote the salvation of the Church, and take more pleasure in
vaunting before the people than in edifying the Church of Christ. St. Paul,
already perceiving in his time that imminent danger, said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Desire to pursue
spiritual gifts, but still more that you may prophesy."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 14:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For in the Christian Church the most important point,
and that which we ought above all things to desire, is that the hidden meanings
and divine mysteries of Scripture may be explained to us with some advantage. If
that is wanting, the rest must gradually be thrown down, as we have found it to
be in past ages, to the great injury of the whole
Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We must therefore devote ourselves to
this gift above all others, for fear of abusing those passages of Scripture
which have been turned to a wrong purpose, or of being ourselves guilty of
torturing those passages to a meaning which is foreign to them. And especially
we must throw ourselves on the doctrine of the prophets; for they who are
faithfully employed in them open up a road for easily going higher, and lay a
firm and solid foundation for salvation. Now, if that exercise was ever
necessary, it is at the present time, when we must make war not only against
Papists or Jews, but against dreadful monsters which, concealed under the
appearance of men, endeavor to overturn all religion and
humanity.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Among all the prophets Isaiah justly
holds the chief place, because he gives very clear testimonies concerning
Christ, and places before our eyes the state and condition of his Church, that
is, of his kingdom, as the reading will alone clearly shew, so that it will be
unnecessary for me to make a long preface. He who shall have understood him well
will be abundantly prepared for reading the other Prophets. The perusal of these
Commentaries will enable you better to understand how well adapted the doctrine
of Isaiah is to the present time; and if you are diligent and attentive, I am
not afraid that you will think that I have labored in
vain.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet if you compared this work with the
Sermons which the Author preached on that Prophet, you might well exclaim, as
AEschines did with regard to Demosthenes, "What would you have thought if you
had heard him speak it?" He adjusted his sentences so admirably, touched the
hearts of his hearers, explained every thing by familiar and obvious examples,
and treated his subjects in so popular a manner, that he seemed actually to
place it before their eyes. Very frequently, too, an opportunity presented
itself of discoursing on some passage, when it would have been impossible
purposely to select out of the whole Scripture a passage better adapted to the
place, the persons, and the occasion; so that all were astonished at it, and
clearly understood that it had not been directed by the wisdom of a man, but by
the Spirit of God; and the advantage which afterwards resulted from it fully
verified that conclusion.</font><br><font face="Palatino">If these Sermons can
ever be published, (which I should earnestly desire,) you will know these things
better, though the truth of what has been said cannot be so clearly perceived by
any as by those who have seen them with their eyes. Here you have the substance,
however, both of the Sermons and of the Lessons, from which I shall reckon
myself to have derived great benefit, if you partake of it as you ought. It was
my study, it was the object which I proposed to myself, not to have any favor
from men, but to be of advantage to believers; and, so far as my conscience
bears me witness, I see not why I ought to dread the judgment of men. I hold it
to be certain that they who shall carefully weigh the whole will judge of me
with candour; and that, if there be any fault or omission in what I have done,
they will cheerfully lay in the balance the benefit which they shall have
derived from the work.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Geneva, <i>December</i>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">EPISTOLARY
DEDICATION</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>BY</b></font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">NICOLAS
DES GALLARS</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>TO HIS ANCIENT
FRIEND,</b></font><br><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">JOHN
CRISPIN</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Whenever I call to remembrance, my dear Crispin, (as
I cannot but often do,) that eminent and godly pastor of the Church, John
Calvin, I have a feeling of deep grief, and at the same time of joy. For when I
bring before my mind the candour and uprightness of that man, his kind
disposition towards me, and the pleasant and intimate friendship which I enjoyed
with him for sixteen years, it is impossible that I should not be deeply
affected by the loss of such a friend, or, I ought rather to say, of such a
parent. Nor is it only on my own account that I grieve, but rather on account of
the whole Church, which has been deprived of so great a man, and has thus
sustained a heavy loss by his death.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What
labors, what watchings and solicitudes he endured, with what faithfulness and
wisdom he attended to the interests of all, with what frankness and courtesy he
received those who visited him, how ready and clear were his replies to those
who consulted him even on the weightiest matters, how learnedly, both in private
and in public, he solved the difficult and perplexing questions which were
proposed to him, with what gentleness he comforted the afflicted and cheered
those who were faint and sorrowful, with what firmness he resisted adversaries,
and with what energy he was wont to restrain the haughty and obstinate, with
what strength of mind he bore adversity, what moderation he exercised in
prosperity, and, in short, with what ability and cheerfulness he performed all
the duties of a true and faithful servant of God, I certainly cannot find words
to express! Lest any one should think that the ardor of my regard for him
prompts me to make these statements, let him consider the actual facts, which
truly exceed the power both of speech and of thought. Besides the writings and
records which convey a stupendous testimony of his virtues, many things were
done and many were spoken by him which cannot be made known to all, as they are
known to those who were present when he did or uttered
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When I recall those remarkable events, my
grief is alleviated; and the advantage which is derived from them, and which is
shared with me by so many godly men, gives me consolation. My joy is of such a
nature, and is so steady and full, that it swallows up all my sorrow and
lamentation however great. And on this ground also do I congratulate you, my
dear Crispin, that you not only peruse with the highest delight the works and
writings of that man whom you ardently loved, but labor to impart them to
others. Those treasures of wisdom are thus enlarged, and return with high
interest to those from whom they come. You thus cause the regret for the loss of
so great a man to be alleviated, and the grief produced by his lamented and
early death to be diminished.</font><br><font face="Palatino">For the third
time, after having been wrought and polished on your anvil, this book now comes
forth, which I may truly call a treasure, because it contains vast riches of
heavenly grace, and opens up the path to what is greater. Whoever shall give to
it a cheerful and labourious perusal, let him know with certainty that he will
not return empty; for he will gather what shall be advantageous with regard not
only to this Prophet but to all the other Prophets, and to the whole of
Scripture, and if he attend to the directions which are scattered throughout the
book, he will undoubtedly possess a strong light for beholding and enjoying
those things which were hidden and concealed from many. By frequently applying
your hand, therefore, to this work, you not only gratify me, who first sent it
forth after long and severe toil, but you gratify all those who have perused or
even tasted the work. You might have sufficiently perceived and actually known
this from the numerous copies which have been already
circulated.</font><br><font face="Palatino">I have not been disappointed in the
expectation which I at that time formed, when during the whole period of four
years, with unwearied toil, having first heard the public Sermons and afterwards
the private Lectures, but employing my own judgment and style, I returned home
and committed these things to writing. And whenever I recollect that period,
during which this Church, which formerly was small and feeble, received
wonderful accessions, I cannot but feel the utmost joy. You also may well
remember what was its condition when, banished from your native country, you
first came hither; and likewise what large additions had been made to it when
you brought your family, and settled down permanently here for the express
purpose of assisting the efforts of the godly by your skill and
industry.</font><br><font face="Palatino">These things I take pleasure in
relating, in order that, by calling to remembrance what you have experienced, I
may quicken your zeal, and may stimulate you to perform those things which you
have undertaken, and of which it will be impossible for you ever to repent, and
may give a fresh impulse even to your cheerful and willing exertions. Proceed
then, my dear Crispin, in assisting by your diligence the efforts of those who
are devoted to Sacred Literature, and labor not only to promote this work, but
also to publish others. You see that many things, though useful in the highest
degree, are passed by and almost neglected by those who aim at immediate gain
rather than at public usefulness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The smaller
Treatises of this Author were edited by me fifteen years ago; and although since
that time he wrote many other Treatises, yet no one put his hand to that work,
so as to bring out a uniform edition, (I speak of the Latin copies,) either of
those or of others which were afterwards added. I therefore earnestly and
repeatedly urge my request, that you will take charge of those works, and also
of others with which you are well acquainted, and that you will not allow any of
the writings of so great a man to be lost; and, in short, that you will grant
the request made to you by godly and studious persons, and that you will fulfill
and go beyond those expectations respecting you which you have already excited.
May God favor your undertakings, and make you prosperous and
happy!</font><br><font face="Palatino">Geneva, <i>January</i> 1,

TRANSLATOR'S</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PREFATORY
ADDRESS</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>TO THE READERS</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is upwards of twenty years, my dear Readers, since
the Lessons of Mr. John Calvin, having been collected by <i>Mr. Nicolas Des
Gallars</i>, were published under the title of a Commentary, and dedicated to
that illustrious Prince, of blessed memory, Edward VI., King of England. Long
afterwards, the Author himself, revising that collection printed in Latin and in
French, was not satisfied with merely revising it, so as to elucidate what might
be obscure on account of its brevity, and to arrange better what was confused,
but labored so diligently and so successfully, that he enlarged it in Latin, by
more than a third, with excellent and necessary matter for understanding the
text, putting everything so completely in its proper order, that if any person
will take the trouble of comparing the first Commentary, or Collection of
Lessons, with this second edition, he will find that what we have said is
true.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What is more, it was not in the school
that this Commentary was collected for the second time, but it was written in
the house, and word for word, under the eye of the Author, who has so skillfully
arranged and digested the whole, that when you read it, you will perceive that
in this book, as in others which have already come forth from him, he did much
good service to the Church of God, and faithfully pointed out the road to those
who wish to make progress in the study of theology, especially by these
Commentaries, which, when they are read attentively, will not only be very
useful for explaining the true meaning of the prophet Isaiah, but will not less
contribute to throw light on many passages of the other books of the Holy
Scripture. This has induced me to translate them anew into French, in order that
those of you who do not understand the Latin tongue may not be deprived of such
an advantage. Read, and profit in the fear of the Lord.</font><br></div>

The burden of Damascus.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he prophesies
against the kingdom of Syria, and mentions the chief city in which the seat of
the kingdom lay. It was proper that this calamity, like others which came before
it, should be described, that the righteous might confidently believe that God
would one day assist them, and would not always permit them to be oppressed by
the wicked without end. The king of Syria had formed an alliance with Israel
against Judah, as we saw formerly in the seventh chapter; and as the Jews were
not able to contend with him, and were deprived of other aids, they might also
entertain doubts about God's assistance, as if he had utterly abandoned them. To
free them, therefore, from these doubts, he threatens the destruction of that
kingdom, from which they would readily conclude that God fought in defense of
his people.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is uncertain at what time Isaiah
uttered this prophecy, for, as I have already remarked, he does not follow the
order of time in threatening against each nation the punishment which it
deserved. But, as far as I am able to conjecture, he foretold those events at
the time when those two kings, that is, the kings of Israel and Syria, invaded
Judea, and entered into a league to destroy it and the whole Church,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
7:1, 2;) for, by joining together the Israelites and the Syrians, he summons
them to a mutual judgment, in order to show that the only advantage which they
had derived from the wicked and disgraceful conspiracy was, to be involved in
the same destruction. In this manner Isaiah intended to comfort godly persons
who were of the tribe of Judah; for he has his eye chiefly on them, that they
may not be discouraged, and not on the Syrians, or even the Israelites, whose
destruction he
foretells.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, Damascus is
taken away.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The demonstrative particle,
<i>Behold,</i> seals the certainty of the prophecy. When he expressly mentions
<i>Damascus,</i> it does not follow from this that the other parts of the
kingdom are exempted, but it was customary with the prophets to take a part for
the whole, so as to include under the destruction of the metropolis the fate of
the whole nation; for what must ordinary towns expect when the citadel of the
kingdom has been stormed? Yet there is another reason why the Prophets pronounce
heavier threatenings on the chief and royal cities, and especially direct their
discourse against them. It is, because a polluted flood of crimes overflows from
them into the whole country.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The cities of Aroer are
forsaken.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is not probable that Aroer here
denotes the city which is mentioned elsewhere,

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050236&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
2:36, 3:12, 4:48;) but it is rather the name of a country. He draws the picture
of a country which has been ruined; for he shews that those places in which
cities had been built will be devoted to pasture, and that no habitation will be
left there but huts and shepherds' tents; for if any inhabitants remained, the
shepherds would drive their flocks to some other
place.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The fortress shall
cease.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F261</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He points out the reason why the Lord
determines to cut off the kingdom of Syria. Amos (Amos 1:3) enumerates
additional reasons, but the most important was that which the Prophet mentions,
namely, that they had drawn the kingdom of Israel to their side for the purpose
of making war against the Jews. The Israelites were undoubtedly allured, by the
blandishments of the Syrians, to form an alliance with them against their
brethren. It was a pretext exceedingly fitted to impose upon them, that the
Syrians would aid them against all their enemies; and hence also the Israelites
placed confidence in the forces and power of the Syrians to such an extent, that
they reckoned themselves able to oppose any adversary. All Israel is here, as in
many other passages, denoted by the name <i>Ephraim,</i> which was the chief
tribe of that people. Now, "the assistance and kingdom" are said to "cease" from
any place, when its strength is broken and its rank is thrown
down.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the remnant of
Syria.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> That is, both of these nations, the
Syrians and the Israelites, shall be brought to nothing; and, for the purpose of
giving additional weight to the prophecy, he states that it is God who declares
it; for he immediately adds these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>saith Jehovah of
hosts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Now, when the Lord punished so
severely those two kingdoms, he unquestionably promoted in this way the benefit
of his Church, delivering it by the destruction of its enemies. And, indeed, in
destroying both nations, he employed as his agents the Assyrians, to whom even
the Jews had applied; and although in this respect they had heinously sinned,
yet their offense did not hinder the Lord from promoting the benefit of his
Church, or from delivering it by bringing its enemies into conflict with each
other. Hence we perceive how great is the care which God exercises over us,
since he does not spare even the greatest kingdoms in order to preserve us. We
ought also to observe, that though all the wicked enter into a league, and join
hands to destroy us, yet the Lord will easily rescue us from their jaws.
Besides, we ought to remark that it is advantageous to us to be deprived of
earthly aids, on which it is in vain for us to rely in opposition to God; for
when we are blinded by our prosperity, we flatter ourselves, and cannot hear the
voice of God. It therefore becomes necessary to remove these obstructions, that
we may perceive our helplessness, as was the case with the Israelites, who were
bereft of their aid after Syria had been
destroyed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The glory of Jacob shall be
diminished.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F262</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Although he had undertaken to speak of
Syria and Damascus, he takes occasion to join Israel with the Syrians, because
they were bound by a mutual league, and were united in the same cause. The
Syrians, indeed, whom Isaiah chiefly addresses, were like a torch to inflame the
Israelites, as we have already said. But the Israelites themselves were equally
in fault, and therefore they were justly drawn, by what might be called a mutual
bond, to endure the same punishment.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is not
easy to say whether under the name <i>Jacob</i> he speaks of the whole elect
people, so as to include also the tribe of Judah. But it is probable that he
refers only to the ten tribes, who laid claim to the name of the nation, and
that it is in mockery that he describes them as <i>glorious,</i> because, being
puffed up with their power and multitude and allies, they despised the Jews
their brethren.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the
fatness of his flesh shall wax lean.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When he
next threatens them with <i>leanness,</i> his object is to reprove their
indolence, as the Prophets frequently reprove them for their fatness
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240528&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
5:28; 50:11). On account of their prosperity and of the fertility of the
country, they became proud, as horses that are fat and excessively pampered grow
restive. Hence also they are elsewhere called "fat cows"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;300401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Amos
4:1). But however fierce and stubborn they might be, God threatens that he will
take away their fatness with which they were puffed
up.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall be as when the
harvest-man gathereth the corn.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He shews by a
comparison how great will be the desolation. "As the reapers," he says, "gather
the corn in armfuls, so this multitude, though large and extended, will be mowed
down by the enemies." Now that he may not leave a remainder, he adds that at the
conclusion of the harvest <i>the ears will be gleaned,</i> as if he had said,
that when the multitude shall have been destroyed and the country laid bare like
a field which has been reaped, even the shaken and scattered ears will not be
left. Besides, he employs the metaphor of a harvest because the people, trusting
to their great number, dreaded nothing; but as the reapers are not terrified by
the large quantity of the corn, so he declares that their vast number will not
prevent God from utterly destroying them. This may also refer to the Assyrians,
but the meaning will be the same, for they were God's servants in executing this
vengeance.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We need not spend much time in
explaining the word <i>gather,</i> for it means nothing else than that the
slaughter will resemble a harvest, the conclusion of which has been followed by
the gleaning of the ears. When the ten tribes had been carried away, the
Assyrians, having learned that they were meditating a revolution, destroyed them
also
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121704&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 17:4). He especially mentions <i>the valley of Rephaim,</i> because its
fertility was well known to the
Israelites.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yet gleaning grapes shall be left
in it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This metaphor has a different meaning
from the former; for as if the name of the nation were to be entirely blotted
out, he had expressly foretold that nothing would be left after the slaughter.
He now adds a consolation, and thus abates the severity of the destruction; for
he declares that, although the enemies had resolved to consume and destroy
everything, still some remnant would be left. In like manner the gleaning of
grapes is never made so completely as not to allow some grapes or even clusters
to remain, which were concealed under the leaves, and the olive tree is never so
thoroughly shaken as not to leave at least some olives on the tops of the trees.
Consequently, to whatever extent the enemies may rage, and even the vengeance of
God may be kindled, still he foretells that the Judge, notwithstanding his
severity, will reserve for himself a small number, and will not allow the
attacks of enemies to fall upon his own
elect.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence it follows, that amidst the
heaviest vengeance there will still be room for mercy. The present discourse
relates to the posterity of Abraham; and though they had revolted from God so as
to deserve to be cast off, yet the goodness of God rose above their wickedness.
They had indeed rendered themselves unworthy of such goodness, but the covenant
of God must remain firm and impregnable, and a proof of that firmness must be
given by him in some remnant, though the nation entirely set it aside as far as
lay in their power. This ought to be carefully observed, so that when we
perceive no traces of the Church, and when the godly appear to be destroyed,
still we may not think that the Church has perished; for the promise of the Lord
stands, that it will continue for ever
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011707&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
17:7). Some remnant, therefore, will always remain, though frequently it is not
visible to our eyes.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>At that day shall a man look to
his Maker.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now shews the fruit of this
chastisement, and this is the second consolation with which the godly ought to
fortify themselves amidst their afflictions. Although they perceive nothing but
the wrath of God, yet they ought to reflect that the Lord, who never forgets
himself, will continually preserve his Church, and not only so, but that the
chastisements will be advantageous to them. After having spoken, therefore,
about the continual existence of the Church, he next adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>men will look to
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This is the most desirable of all,
for when men betake themselves to God, the world, which was formerly disordered,
is restored to its proper order; but when we have been estranged from him, no
one repents of his own accord, and therefore there is no other way in which we
can be brought back than to be driven by the scourge of chastisements. We are
thus reminded that we ought not to be so impatient in enduring chastisements,
which cure us of the fearfully dangerous disease of
apostasy.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To look to
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"> means nothing else than that, when we have
turned away, we return to a state of favor with him, betake ourselves and are
converted to him. For how comes it that men abandon themselves to every kind of
wickedness but because they forget God? Where the knowledge of God exists, there
reverence dwells; where forgetfulness of God is found, there contempt of him
also prevails. Yet this relates properly to faith, as if he had said, "When
chastisements so severe shall have tamed the Israelites, they will then perceive
that there is no help for them but in God. For this reason he immediately adds
the expression, <i>To his</i> <i>Maker</i>. It was indeed a proof of abominable
indolence that they did not rely on God alone, who had bestowed on them so many
precious gifts. The Prophet therefore says, that when they had been subdued by
distresses and afflictions, they would afterwards return to a sound mind, so as
to begin to hope in him who had bound them to himself by so many acts of
kindness. And indeed he calls God their <i>Maker,</i> not as having created the
whole human race, but in the same sense in which he likewise calls him
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Holy One of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Although therefore all men were created
after the image of God,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010127&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
1:27), yet Israel was peculiarly his workmanship, because he was his heritage,
and his holy and chosen people
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021906&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
19:6). This repetition, in accordance with the ordinary custom of the Hebrew
language, is employed to denote the same thing. He therefore calls God
<i>Holy,</i> not only as viewed in himself, but from the effect produced,
because he has sanctified or separated to himself the children of Abraham. Hence
it follows, that the creation which he speaks of must be understood to relate to
spiritual reformation, in reference to which he is especially called <i>the
Maker of Israel</i>
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234511&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
45:11;

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he shall not look to the
altars.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This contrast shews more clearly that
the <i>looking</i> which he spoke of in the former verse relates strictly to
hope and confidence, for he says that every kind of sinful confidence will
vanish away when men have learned to hope in God; and indeed in no other manner
can any one obtain clear views of God than by driving far from him all
superstitions. We are thus taught that obstacles of this kind ought to be
removed if we wish to approach to God. It is vain to think of making a union
between God and idols, as the Papists do, and as the Jews formerly did; for that
vice is not peculiar to our age, but has prevailed in all ages. Every
obstruction ought therefore to be removed, that we may look to God with such
earnestness as to have just and clear views of him, and to put our trust in
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The work of his
hands.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is for the purpose of exciting
abhorrence that he calls the false gods
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the work of their
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that the Israelites, being
ashamed of their folly, may shake off and drive away from them such a
disgraceful reproach. On this vice, however, he dwells the more largely, because
they were more chargeable with it than with any other, and because none can be
more abominable in the sight of God. There were innumerable superstitions among
them, and in places without number they had set up both idols and altars, so
that Isaiah had good reason for reproving and expostulating with them at great
length on account of these crimes.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It might be
objected that the altar at Jerusalem was also built by men, and therefore they
ought to forsake it in order to approach to God.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;022701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
27:1). I reply, that altar was widely different from others, for although it
consisted of stone and mortar, silver and gold, and was made like others by the
agency of men, yet we ought not to look at the materials or the workmanship, but
at God himself who was the maker, for by his command it was built. We ought
therefore to consider the essential form, so to speak, which it received from
the word of God; other matters ought not to be taken into view, since God alone
is the architect.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;022024&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
20:24, 25;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;052705&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
27:5, 6). Other altars, though they bore some resemblance to it, should be
abhorred, because they had not the authority of the word. Such is the estimate
which we ought to form of every kind of false worship, whatever appearance of
sanctity it may assume; for God cannot approve of anything that is not supported
by his word.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that day shall his strong

Here the particle

(<i>asher,</i>) I have no doubt, denotes comparison; and therefore I have
rendered it <i>in like</i> <i>manner as,</i> which makes the statement of the
Prophet to be, in connection with what had been already said, that the people
would tremble and flee and be scattered, in the same manner as God had formerly
driven out the ancient inhabitants. Those who think that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>asher,</i>) is a relative are constrained to supply something, and to break
up the thread of the discourse. But it simply brings to their remembrance an
ancient example, that the Israelites may perceive how vain and deceitful is
every kind of defense that is opposed to the arm of God. It is a severe
reproach; for the Israelites did not consider that the Lord gave to them that
land, as it were, by hereditary right, in order that they might worship him, and
that he drove out their enemies to put them in possession of it. And now, by
their ingratitude, they rendered themselves unworthy of so great a benefit; and,
consequently, when they had been deprived of it, there was good reason why they
should feel distresses which were the reverse of their former
blessings.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This passage will be made more plain
by the writings of Moses, wholly the prophets follow; for in the promises he
employs this mode of expression, "One of you shall chase a thousand,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;032608&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
26:8;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;062310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joshua
23:10), and in the threatenings, on the other hand, he says, "One shall chase a
thousand of you."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;053230&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
32:30.) Accordingly, as he struck such terror into the Canaanites, that at the
sight of the Israelites they immediately fled, so he punished the ingratitude of
the people in such a manner that they had no power to resist. Thus the Lord gave
a display of his power in two ways, both in driving out the Canaanites and in
punishing his people. The Prophet, therefore, by mentioning that ancient
kindness, reproaches the people with ingratitude, forgetfulness, and treachery,
that they may acknowledge that they are justly punished, and may perceive that
it proceeds from the Lord, that they are thus chased by the enemies to whom they
were formerly a terror.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because thou hast forgotten the
God of thy salvation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He shews the reason why
the Lord exercises such severity against the Ten Tribes, that they may not
complain of being unjustly afflicted or too harshly treated. The sum of what is
stated is, that all those evils come to them because they have wickedly despised
God. It was excessively base and altogether inexcusable ingratitude, after
having received so many favors, to prostitute their hopes to heathen nations and
to idols, as if they had never in any respect experienced the love of God.
Indeed, no unbelievers, when they are called to account, will vindicate
themselves from the charge of offering an insult to God by wandering after
creatures. But the argument was applicable, in a special manner, to the people
of Israel, to whom God had revealed himself in such a manner that they ought to
have left off all the impostures of the world and relied on his grace alone.
They are therefore justly accused of ingratitude, for having buried in
forgetfulness the object of true faith; and indeed, when God has once allowed us
to taste the delight of his goodness, if it gain a place in our hearts, we shall
never be drawn away from it to anything else. Hence it follows that they are
convicted of ingratitude who, not being satisfied with the true God, are
unsteady and driven about in all directions; for in this manner they despise his
invaluable grace.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Accordingly, the Prophet
expressly calls him </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the God of
salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and the <i>God</i> or

(<i>tsur</i>) has both significations; for it was a monstrous thing that they
were not kept in fidelity to God, who had so often preserved them, and, as it
were, with an outstretched hand. When he adds that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had not been
mindful</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> this is an amplification; for
he indirectly charges them with base slothfulness in not considering in how many
ways they had formerly been made to know the kindness of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore thou shalt
plant.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Next follows the punishment, that they
might not think that this ingratitude would remain unpunished. That is, because
they forsook the fountain of all good, though they labor to obtain food, yet
they will be consumed by famine and hunger; for all that shall be obtained with
great labor the enemy will either carry away or destroy. This passage is taken
from Moses; for it is a curse pronounced amidst other curses.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlj</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>chalah,</i>) and I do not see how the word "Branch" agrees with it. I grant,
indeed, that as vines are mentioned, the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Harvest</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is employed
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">katacrhstikw~v</font><font face="Palatino">)
differently from its natural meaning.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It might
also be rendered a Collector; and yet I do not choose to dispute keenly about
those two significations, for the meaning will be the same, provided that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jljn</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>nachalah</i>) be understood to denote "the gathering of the fruits." In this
way the passage will flow easily enough. "Though you labor hard in dressing the
vines, and though you begin your toil at the earliest dawn, you will gain
nothing; for by the mere shaking of the branches the fruit will fall off of its
own accord, or your vines will be plundered." Thus, by a figure of speech in
which a part is taken for the whole, the word <i>plant</i> denotes that
unwearied toil which husbandmen and vine-dressers are wont to bestow on plants
and vines.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This is a very severe punishment, and
undoubtedly proceeds from the curse of God; for if he who has no possession be
driven out and banished from a country, he will not be rendered so uneasy as the
man who has well cultivated fields, and particularly if he has bestowed his
labor on them for a long time. In this manner the Lord determined to punish the
Israelites, because they abused the fertility of the country and grew wanton
amidst their abundance. A similar punishment is also threatened against the
wicked in general terms, that "in vain do they rise early, and vex themselves
with unremitted toil;" for they gain nothing by it.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19C702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
127:2). On the other hand, it is declared that they who trust in the Lord will
undoubtedly receive the reward of their toil, for the blessing of God will
accompany their labors.

F266</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for he groans on account of the calamity
which he foresees will befall Israel, and he does so either out of brotherly
affection, or in order that the prophecy may make a more powerful impression on
the minds of a sluggish and indolent people. It is certain, that the prophets
regarded with greater horror than other men the vengeance of God, of which they
were the heralds; and although, in sustaining the character assigned to them,
they threatened severely, still they never laid aside human feelings, so as not
to have compassion on those who perished. But the chief reason was a
consideration of the covenant which God had made with the seed of Abraham; and
we see that Paul also had this feeling to such an extent, that he "wished to be
accursed for his brethren."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450903&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:3). When therefore Isaiah brings the fact before his mind, he cannot but be
deeply affected with grief; and yet, as I have hinted, it tends to make the fact
more certain, when he places it before his eyes as if he actually saw
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The word <i>multitude</i> is here employed,
because the army had been collected out of many and various nations, of which
the Assyrian monarchy was composed. The metaphors which he adds are intended for
no other purpose than to exhibit more forcibly what has been already stated; for
he compares them to a sea or a deluge, which overflows a whole
country.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The nations shall
rush.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Although he appears to follow out that
threatening, which he formerly uttered, yet he begins to comfort believers by
repeating the same statement, as if we should say, "They who were unmindful of
God must be punished for their wicked revolt, and must be, as it were,
overwhelmed by a deluge; but the Lord will restrain this savage disposition of
the enemies, for, when they have exercised their cruelty, he shall find a method
of casting them out and driving them away." This is a remarkable consolation, by
which he intended to support the remnant of the godly. Nor does he speak of the
Jews only, as is commonly supposed, for hitherto he has addressed his discourse
to the ten tribes, and it is certain that there were still left in Israel some
who actually feared God, and who would have despaired if they had not been
upheld by some promise.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By these metaphors he
describes dreadful storms and tempests. When the Holy Spirit intends to bring
comfort to the godly, he holds out those objects which are wont to terrify and
discourage the minds of men, that we may learn that God will easily allay all
tempests, however violent and dreadful. As the winds and seas and storms are at
his command, so it is easy for him to restrain enemies and their violence; and
therefore immediately afterwards he compares the Assyrians to
<i>chaff.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As the chaff of
the mountains before the wind.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Although with
regard to the Israelites their attack was terrible, yet he shews that before God
they will be like <i>chaff,</i> for without any effort he will scatter all their
forces. Hence it follows that we ought not to judge of their resources and
strength by our senses. Whenever therefore we see the restraints laid on the
wicked withdrawn,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F267</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that they may rush forward for our
destruction, let us indeed consider that, so far as lies in ourselves, we are
ruined, but that God can easily frustrate their attacks.

(<i>galgal</i>) means <i>a rolling
thing,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

wind.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And, behold, at evening tide
trouble.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The meaning is, "As when a storm has
been raised in the <i>evening,</i> and soon afterwards allayed, no trace of it
is found in the <i>morning,</i> so will cheerful prosperity suddenly arise,
contrary to expectation." The Prophet intended to state two things &#8212;
first, that the attack of the enemy will be sudden; and secondly, that the
ravages which they shall commit will not be of long duration. As the Assyrians
rose suddenly against the Israelites, so their fall was
sudden.</font><br><font face="Palatino">From this passage all the godly ought to
draw wonderful consolation, whenever they see that everything is in disorder,
and when dreadful changes are at hand; for what is it but a sudden storm which
the Lord will allay? Tyrants rush upon us like storms and whirlwinds, but the
Lord will easily dispel their rage. Let us therefore patiently wait for his
assistance; for though he permit us to be tossed about, yet through the midst of
the tempests he will at length conduct us "to the haven."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A730&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
107:30.) And if the Prophet comforted a small remnant, who appeared to be almost
none at all, this promise undoubtedly belongs to us also. True, we are almost
none, and a wretched church is concealed in a few corners; but if we look at the
condition of the kingdom of Israel, how few were the servants of God in it! And
these hardly ventured to mutter, such was the universal hatred of religion and
godliness. Although therefore the Lord destroy the multitude of the wicked, yet
to the small number of the godly, who may be said to be tossed about in the same
ship with them, he will hold out a plank to rescue them from shipwreck, and will
guide them safely and comfortably into the
harbour.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is the
portion.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He addresses the believers who were
concealed in the kingdom of Israel, and joins them with the Church, although, as
is frequently the case with the children of God, the members were scattered in
every direction. We see here what will be the end of the wicked who have
persecuted us. Though we are exposed to their rage, so that they tear and
plunder and trample upon us, and inflict on us every kind of insult, yet they
will be like storms which are subdued by their own violence and quickly
disappear. We ought to expect that this will be the lot of all the tyrants who
at the present day wretchedly harass the Church, and treat cruelly the children
of God. Let this consolation be engraved on our minds, that we may know that the
same thing will happen to them.</font><br></div>

the nation of which Isaiah speaks, though he shews plainly that it bordered on
<i>Ethiopia.</i> Some consider it to refer to the whole of Egypt; but this is a
mistake, for in the next chapter he treats of Egypt separately, from which it is
evident that the people here meant were distinct from the Egyptians. Some think
that the Troglodytes are here meant, which does not appear to me to be probable,
for they had no intercourse with other nations, because their language, as
geographers tell us, was hissing and not
speech;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F269</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but those who are mentioned evidently
had intercourse and leagues with other
nations.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Still it is uncertain whether they
leagued against the Jews or joined with the Egyptians in driving out the
Assyrians. If they were avowed enemies to the Jews, Isaiah threatens punishment;
but if they deceived them by false promises, he shews that nothing is to be
expected from them, because by idle messages they will only protract the time.
However that may be, from the neighboring nations to be mentioned in the next
chapter, we may in part ascertain where they were situated, that is, not far
from Egypt and Ethiopia: yet some may be disposed to view it as a description of
that part of Ethiopia which lay on the sea-coast; for we shall afterwards see
that the Assyrians were at war with the king of the Ethiopians.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233709&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
37:9.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he says that that

well supplied with harbours, so that it had many vessels sailing to it and was
wealthy; for small and poor states could not maintain intercourse or traffic

voyages.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sending ambassadors by the

those times. It would appear that this nation solicited the Egyptians or Syrians
to harass the Jews, or that the Assyrians employed them for the purpose of
harassing the Jews, or that they had formed an alliance with the Egyptians, in
order that, by their united force, they might prevent the power of the Assyrians
from increasing beyond bounds; for nothing more than conjectures can be offered,
because we have no histories that give any account of it, and where historical
evidence is wanting, we must resort to probable conjectures. These voyages,
there is reason to believe, were not made to any place near at hand, but to a
distant country.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In ships of

F270</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We ought not to think it strange that he
calls them </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ships of
reeds</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> for it is evident from the
ancient histories that these were commonly used by the Egyptians, because the
channel of the Nile is in some places very steep and dangerous to navigators on
account of the cataracts, which the Greeks call
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Kata&gt;doupa</font><font face="Palatino">,
so that ships of wood cannot be used at those places without being broken and
dashed to pieces on the rocks; and therefore it is necessary to employ ships of
pliant materials. That the ships might not admit water and thus be sunk,
historians tell us that they were daubed within with
pitch.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go, ye swift
messengers.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This passage is obscure, but I
shall follow what I consider to be probable. The Prophet shews the design of his
prediction, or the reason why he foretold the destruction of that nation. If we
believe them to have been the avowed enemies of the Jews, the design was to
afford some consolation to believers who were wretchedly broken up and
scattered, that having received this message they might rejoice and give thanks
to God. But if we rather think that the Jews were led by this nation into an
unlawful league, we must then consider that this exhortation is ironical, and
that the Prophet intended to reprove the folly of the chosen people, in
forsaking God and relying on useless aid. Some think that these words were
spoken by God, as if he commanded those nations who inhabited the sea-coast to
destroy the Jews; but I am not at all of that
opinion.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To a nation scattered
and plundered.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F271</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I do not agree with those who think that
these words describe the destruction of that unknown and obscure nation; for by
"a plundered nation" he means the Jews who were to be grievously harassed and
scattered, so that no part of them escaped
injury.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To a people terrible
from their beginning hitherto.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He calls it
<i>terrible,</i> because so great calamities would disfigure it in such a manner
that all who beheld it would be struck with terror. I cannot approve of the
exposition given by some, that this relates to the signs and miracles which the
Lord performed amongst them, so as to render them an object of dread to all men;
for the allusion is rather to that passage in the writings of Moses, "The Lord
will make thee an astonishment and a terror."
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;052837&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy

18:16; 19:8; 25:9, 13, 18.) He therefore means that they are a nation so
dreadful to behold as to fill all men with astonishment, and we know that this
was foretold and that it also happened to the
Jews.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A nation trodden down on

side,</i> as if one drew lines and joined them so closely that no space was left
between them, or as if one drew furrows in a field so as to break every clod;
for in this manner was the nation thrown down and trampled under foot.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F273</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whose
land the rivers have spoiled.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By <i>the
rivers</i> he means the vast army of the enemies, that is, of the Assyrians. He
alludes to what he had formerly said, that the nation, not satisfied with its
own little stream, longed for rapid and boisterous rivers.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230806&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
8:6.) After having applied to them for assistance, they were overwhelmed by them
as by a deluge; and the reason of the whole evil was this, that they were not
satisfied with the promises of God, and sought assistance in another quarter.
Now, if this command is understood to be given to the <i>swift</i>
<i>messengers</i> in the name of God, we infer from it that he does not
immediately assist his own people, but delays his aid till they are brought to a
state of despair. He does not send to them a cheerful and prosperous message
while they are still uninjured, or when they have received a light stroke, but
he sends a message to a nation altogether trodden down and trampled under foot.
Yet when he commands them to make haste, he means that the judgment will be
sudden and unexpected, so that light will suddenly burst forth amidst the
darkness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All ye inhabitants of the

nations.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When he shall lift up

imperative mood;

but it is better to view them as denoting what is future. It is as if he had
said that the most distant nations will be witnesses of this destruction,
because not only will the <i>ensign</i> be beheld by all, but the sound of the
trumpets will be heard throughout the whole world. This will plainly shew that
the war did not originate with men, but with God himself, who will prove himself
to be the author of it by remarkable tokens. When wars are carried on, every one
sees clearly what is done; but the greater part of men ascribe the beginning and
end of them to chance. On the other hand, Isaiah shews that all these things
ought to be ascribed to God, because he will display his power in a new and
extraordinary manner; for sometimes he works so as to conceal his hand and to
prevent his work from being perceived by men, but sometimes he displays his hand
in such a manner that all are constrained to acknowledge it; and that is what
the Prophet meant.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But thus said Jehovah unto
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> After having threatened a slaughter of the
Ethiopians or their neighbors, and at the same time shewn that comfort will
arise from it to the Jews, or ironically reproved the foolish confidence with
which the Jews had been deceived, he now adds that God will regulate these
confused changes in such a manner as to gather to him at length his chosen
people. The particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>ki</i>,) which I have translated <i>but</i>, sometimes means <i>for</i> and
sometimes <i>but</i>. The latter meaning appears to be more appropriate in this
passage, for the Prophet replies to a doubt which otherwise might grievously
perplex weak minds; because when confusion arises, there may be said to be a
veil which conceals from us the providence of God. Such also was the state of
that nation whose destruction he foretells, that this prediction might be
reckoned fabulous and worthy of ridicule; for, as we may gather from it, there
was no danger or change to be
dreaded.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
rest.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some consider this as referring to the
person of Isaiah, as if, relying on what God had revealed, he <i>rested,</i>
that is, was in a state of composure, as we ought to be when we have heard the
word of God, and fully expect what has been foretold. In like manner Habakkuk
also says, <i>On my watch-tower will I stand</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;350201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
2:1.) But unquestionably he relates what the Lord had foretold to him, and the
Lord himself, by the mouth of the Prophet, makes this declaration, <i>I</i>
<i>will rest,</i> that is, I will remain
unemployed.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will look in
my tabernacle.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F276</font><font face="Palatino" size="2">
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">The phrase, <i>I will look,</i> has the same
import with the former; for a spectator takes no part in doing, but rests
satisfied with <i>looking</i>. Such is likewise the force of the term
<i>tabernacle</i>, as if the Lord betook himself to rest under a roof; while, on
the contrary, he says that he ascends the judgment-seat, when he avenges the
transgressions of the wicked; for these modes of expression are adapted to our
capacity. But perhaps it may be thought more probable that the Prophet alludes
to the sanctuary; because, although the majesty of God will remain concealed for
a time among an afflicted people, yet his rest will not be without effect. It
amounts to this, that though everything be turned upside down, so as to awaken a
suspicion that God takes no further concern in the government of the world, yet
he <i>rests</i> for an express purpose, as if he shut himself up unemployed in a
chamber, and the effect of this rest will in due time
appear.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As the heat that
drieth up the rain.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F277</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
By this beautiful metaphor the Prophet expresses more fully what he had formerly
said. Yet there are two ways in which it may be shewn to agree with the
Prophet's meaning; either that God, aroused, as it were, from his rest, will
shew a smiling countenance to gladden believers, or will water them by a
refreshing shower; and in this way the Prophet would describe their varied
success. Or there is an implied contrast, by which he reminds us that, while God
appears to remain unemployed and to look at what is going on, still he can
execute his judgments as if it were in sport. And yet, as the two following
verses are closely connected with this verse, Isaiah appears to mean, that
though God does not act in a bustling manner like men, or proceed with undue
eagerness and haste, still he has in his power concealed methods of executing
his judgments without moving a finger. Perhaps also he intended to shew, that in
destroying this nation, God will act in an extraordinary manner. But we ought to
be satisfied with what I lately suggested, that when men carelessly resign
themselves to sleep in the midst of prosperity, and, intoxicated by their
pleasures, imagine that they have nothing to do with God, "sudden destruction is
at hand," because God, by a look, frustrates all the designs or preparations of
the world.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;520503&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Thessalonians 5:3.) He therefore declares that he will be like a clear and calm
sky,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F278</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>like the heat that drieth up the

dew in the heat of harvest.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F279</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Now we know that this rain is exceedingly adapted to ripen the fruits, and
likewise that the heat which follows the rain penetrates the fruits with its
force, and drives the moisture more inward, by which it hastens their maturity
and renders them more productive. Now the Prophet meant, that though calamities
and distresses await the reprobate, still everything proceeds so much to their
wish, that they appear to be supremely happy, as if the Lord intended to load
them with every kind of blessings; but that they are fattened like oxen destined
for slaughter, for when they appear to have reached the highest happiness, they
suddenly perish.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence it follows, that we ought
not to form an estimate of the judgments of God according to outward
appearances; for when men imagine themselves to be exceedingly safe, they are
not far from destruction and from utter ruin. Thus he speedily comforts
believers, that they may not suppose that it fares better with the reprobate so
long as God forbears to strike; for though he appears to cherish in his bosom
those whom he sustains, he will quickly reduce them to nothing. These statements
ought to be applied to those wretched and disastrous times when the tyrants who
oppress the Church are the only persons that are prosperous, and abound in all
kinds of wealth, and contrive in such a manner as if everything were in their
power, because they surpass other men in power, and skill, and cunning. But let
us know that all these things are done by the appointment of God, who promotes
their endeavors and renders them successful, that he may at length slay and
destroy them in a moment. I am aware that a widely different meaning is given by
some to these words of the Prophet; but any one who takes a judicious view of
the whole passage will have little difficulty, I trust, in assenting to my
interpretation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For when the harvest shall be at
hand.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Literally it is, "in presence of the
harvest;" but we must soften the harshness of the expressions; and it cannot be
doubted that the meaning of the Prophet is, that when the harvest is close at
hand, and when the grapes are nearly ripe, the whole produce, in the expectation
of which wicked men had rejoiced, will suddenly be snatched from them. The
Prophet continues the same subject, and confirms by these metaphors what he had
formerly uttered, that the wicked are not immediately cut off, but flourish for
a time, and the Lord spares them; but that when the harvest shall be at hand,
when the vines shall put forth their buds and blossoms, so that the <i>sour
grapes</i> make their appearance, the branches themselves shall be cut down.
Thus when the wicked shall be nearly ripe, not only will they be deprived of
their fruit, but they and their offspring shall be rooted out. Such is the end
which the Lord will make to the wicked, after having permitted them for a time
to enjoy prosperity; for they shall be rooted out, so that they cannot revive or
spring up again in any way.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we obtain this
great consolation, that when God conceals himself, he tries our faith, and does
not suffer everything to be carried along by the blind violence of fortune, as
heathens imagine; for God is in heaven, as in his tabernacle, dwelling in his
Church as in a mean habitation; but at the proper season he will come forth. Let
us thus enter into our consciences, and ponder everything, that we may sustain
our minds by such a promise as this, which alone will enable us to overcome and
subdue temptations. Let us also consider that the Lord declares that he advances
and promotes the happiness of wicked men, which tends to exhibit and to display
more illustriously the mercy of God. If he instantly cut down and took them away
like a sprouting blade of corn, his power would not be so manifest, nor would
his goodness be so fully ascertained as when he permits them to grow to a vast
height, to swell and blossom, that they may afterwards fall by their own weight,
or, like large and fat ears of corn, cuts them down with
pruning-knives.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
They shall be left together.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F280</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He means that they will be cast aside as
a thing of no value, as John the Baptist also compares them to chaff, which is
thrown on the dunghill.

3:17.) Thus Isaiah shews that they will be exposed to the wild beasts and to the
fowls, so that the fowls will nestle in them in summer, and the wild beasts will
make their lairs in them in winter; as if he had said, that not only men, but
the wild beasts themselves will disdain them. Such therefore is the end of
wicked men, who, situated in a lofty place, and thinking that they are beyond
all danger, despise every one but themselves. The fowls and the beasts of prey
will make use of them for nests and for food. They will be thrown down, I say,
not only beneath all men, but even beneath the beasts themselves, and, being
exposed to every kind of insult and dishonor, they will be a proof of the
wonderful providence of God.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F281</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that
time.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet again shews why he threatened
the destruction of a heathen nation; for when almost all the nations had leagued
together against the Church, it appeared as if the Church were utterly ruined,
and therefore Jehovah declares that in due time he will render assistance. Had
he not opposed such designs, and seasonably restrained the attacks of enemies,
the Jews would have despaired; and on this account he shews that he takes care
of the Church, and that though he determines to chastise it, still he comes
forward at the proper season to hinder it from perishing, and displays his power
in opposition to tyrants and other enemies, that they may not overthrow it or
succeed in accomplishing what they imagined to be in their power. In order
therefore to excite them to patience, he not only distinguishes them from the
Ethiopians, but likewise reminds them that God mitigates his judgments for their
preservation.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A present shall
be brought.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He alludes to the second verse of
this chapter,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;231802&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
18:2 in which we have seen the same names and descriptions applied to the Jewish
nation, and he employs the word <i>brought</i> because they would first of all
be led into captivity, so that it would not be more practicable for them than
for foreign nations to go up into the
temple.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From a
people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This expression deserves notice, for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;[m</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>megnam,</i>) means that it will not be an entire nation; as if he had said,
though you must be reduced to a small number, so as to be a feeble remnant, yet
those few who are left will be offered in sacrifice to God. Hence we ought to
learn a doctrine highly useful and exceedingly adapted to our times, for at the
present day the Church is not far from despair, being plundered, scattered, and
every where crushed and trodden under foot. What must be done in straits so
numerous and so distressing? We ought to lay hold of these promises, so as to
believe that still God will preserve the Church. To whatever extent the body may
be torn, shivered into fragments and scattered, still by his Spirit he will
easily unite the members, and will never allow the remembering and the calling
on his name to perish. Out of those fragments which are now broken and
scattered, the Lord will unite and assemble the people. Those whom He joins
together in one spirit, though widely separated from each other, he can easily
collect into one body. Although therefore we see the nation diminished in
numbers, and some of its members cut off, yet some present will be offered by it
to the Lord.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the place of
the name.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This mode of expression is customary
with the prophets. When they speak of the worship of God they describe it by
outward acts, such as altars, sacrifices, washings, and such like; and, indeed,
the worship of God being within the soul, there is no way in which it can be
described but by outward signs, by which men declare that they worship and adore
God. But he chiefly calls it <i>Mount</i> <i>Zion,</i> because that place was
consecrated to God, and God commanded that sacrifices should be offered there.
The chief honor which he bestowed upon it was when he caused the doctrine of his
word
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
2:3) to go forth from it, as we have formerly
seen;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F282</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> so that the name of <i>Mount Zion</i>
may be properly understood to denote the pure and uncorrupted worship of God. In
short, the prophets do not describe the worship of God as it would be after the
coming of Christ, but as it was in their own time, because they found it
necessary to accommodate themselves to the people to whom they ministered. Hence
it ought to be inferred that there is no other way in which we can belong to the
Church than by being offered to God in sacrifice. Let every one therefore who
wishes to belong to God present himself for such an oblation, and let him no
longer live to himself, but be wholly dedicated to God.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
12:1;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470515&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 5:15.) Now we know that it is by this sword of the word, that is, by
the gospel, that Paul boasts of offering and sacrificing men to God.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451516&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
15:16.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By the place of the
name of the Lord,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he does not mean that his
essence, of which we ought not to form any gross or earthly conception, is
confined to it, as if God were limited to a place, but because it was a place in
which the Lord commanded that his power should be acknowledged, and that men
should worship and call upon him where he manifested his presence by his
benefits and by his power, and that on account of the ignorance of the people,
who could not otherwise comprehend his majesty. Yet it ought to be observed,
that we cannot become acceptable to God without being united in one and the same
faith, that is, without being members of the Church; for it is not necessary for
us to run to Jerusalem, or to <i>Mount Zion,</i> because in the present day
<i>Zion</i> is as wide and extensive as the whole world, which is entirely
devoted to God. All that is necessary therefore is, that the same faith dwell in
us, and that we be joined together by the bond of love. If this be wanting,
every thing about us is heathen, and we have nothing that is sacred or
holy.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The burden of
Egypt.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet here prophesies against
<i>Egypt,</i> because it was a kind of refuge to the Jews, whenever they saw any
danger approaching them; for when they had forsaken God, to whom they ought to
have had recourse, they thought that they had no help left to them but in the
Egyptians. It was therefore necessary that that kingdom should be overthrown,
that its wealth or its forces might no longer deceive the Jews; for so long as
Egypt was prosperous, the Jews thought that, on account of its being exceedingly
populous and highly fortified, they were far removed from danger, and therefore
despised God, or at least paid scarcely any regard to his promises. This led to
evil consequences in two respects; first, because when they ought to have relied
on God alone, they were puffed up with that vain confidence in Egypt; and
secondly, because whenever the Lord punished them, they defended themselves
against his chastisements by the power of the Egyptians, as if by human
resources they could make void his judgments, when they ought to have been
turned to God altogether. On this subject Isaiah speaks more fully in a later
portion of this book.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233002&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
30:2.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, the Lord rideth
on a swift cloud. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This mode of expression is
found also in other passages of Scripture, but in a general form.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
104:3.) The Prophet applies it to this prediction, because the Egyptians thought
that they were so well fortified on all sides, that there was no way by which
God could approach them. He therefore ridicules their foolish confidence, and
exhibits the exalted power of God, when he <i>rideth on a swift cloud,</i> by
which he will easily make a descent upon them, and neither walls nor bulwarks
shall hinder his progress. Again, because in addition to earthly aid the Jews
were likewise bewitched by a false religion, on this ground also the Prophet
ridicules their madness, because God will dash to the ground all the assistance
which they expected to obtain from idols. I pass by the foolish notion which
many have entertained, as to the idols which Christ overthrew in Egypt, when he
was carried thither in infancy; for it does not deserve a refutation.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
2:14.) This passage has been perverted to prove it, and to prove many
conjectures of the same kind. But the Prophet's meaning is totally different;
for he speaks of the defeat of the Egyptians by the Assyrians, and shews that it
ought to be ascribed to God, and not, as irreligious men commonly do, to
fortune. He shews it to be a judgment of God, by whose hand all things are
governed.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the idols of
Egypt shall be moved at his presence.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He
declares that <i>the idols</i> shall fall; that is, that they shall be of no
avail to the Egyptians, though they rely on their assistance, and think that
they are under their protection. No nation ever was so much addicted to
superstitions; for they worshipped cats, and oxen, and crocodiles, and even
onions, and plants of every sort, and there was nothing to which they did not
ascribe some kind of divinity. He means that the power of all those false gods,
whom the Egyptians had taken for their protectors, will be overthrown. Having
declared that the Egyptians rely in vain on their superstitions, he likewise
casts down the pride which they cherished as to their earthly
resources.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the heart of
Egypt shall melt in the midst of her.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By the
word <i>heart</i> he means the courage which sometimes fails even the bravest
men, so that they do not attempt any action, even when their strength and forces
are abundant, and in this manner he declares that they will be at war with God,
who will </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>melt their
hearts</i></font><font face="Palatino"> within them, before they are called to
contend with their enemies. Not only does he threaten that they will be
terrified, but he likewise adds <i>in the</i> <i>midst</i> of the whole kingdom,
where they had an exceedingly safe and peaceful dwelling, because they were far
removed from every attack. It was the duty of all believers to consider this,
when war was waged against the Egyptians; and we also ought to behold the same
thing exemplified in all revolutions of kingdoms, which proceed solely from the
hand of God. If </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the heart
melts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> if the strength fails, in men who
are usually brave, and who had formerly displayed great courage, this ought to
be ascribed to the vengeance of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will set the Egyptians
against the Egyptians.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he describes more
particularly the calamity which the Lord had determined to bring on Egypt. By
the expression, <i>I will set,</i> he means the internal struggles, in which
those who ought to be mutual defenders cut down one another; and no evil can be
more destructive than this to a state or a people. It was of importance also to
convince the Jews that God, in whose hands are the hearts of men,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;202101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
21:1,) could by his unseen influence inflame the Jews to mutual animosities,
that they might slay each other, though they were victorious over foreign
enemies. Hence we learn that nations never rise in a seditious manner, unless
the Lord <i>set them</i> against each other, as when one brings forward
gladiators to the place of combat. He inflames their minds for battle, and
prompts them to slay each other by mutual wounds; and therefore, as we ought to
reckon it an evidence of God's favor, when friendship is cherished among
citizens, so we ought to ascribe it to his vengeance, when they rage against and
slay and injure one
another</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall fight
every one against his brother.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> For the sake of
heightening the picture, he adds what was still more monstrous, that those who
were related to them by blood would take up arms to destroy each other; for if
men are worse than beasts when, forgetting their common nature, they engage in
battle, how much more shocking is it to nature that brethren or allies should
fight with each other! But the more monstrous it is, the more ought we to
acknowledge the judgment of God and his terrible
vengeance</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>City against city,
and kingdom against kingdom.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Isaiah appears to
advance by degrees; for he mentions, first,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a
brother</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> secondly,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a

By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>kingdoms</i></font><font face="Palatino">
he means <i>provinces,</i> into which Egypt was divided, which the Greeks called
nomoi, the term by which the Greek translators have rendered it in this
passage.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

As Isaiah had, a little before, deprived the Egyptians of courage, so he now
takes away their understanding, both of which are exceedingly necessary for the
defense of kingdoms; for when these have been taken away, there is no
possibility of transacting national affairs. Now, the Egyptians had so high an
opinion of their own wisdom, that they reckoned themselves superior to other
nations; and it is well known that they haughtily despised all other nations as
barbarians, as if there had been no civilization, refinement, learning, or
skill, but in Egypt alone. They boasted that they were the inventors of
learning, that philosophy and astronomy came from them, and, in short, that
Egypt was the workshop of all the liberal arts; and therefore they would never
have thought it possible that they should fail in wisdom and prudence, and
unquestionably, if this prediction had come to their knowledge, they would have
laughed at it in disdain, and would have thought, that sooner would the waters
of the sea be dried up, and everything be overturned, than this should befall
those who imagined that prudence was their birthright. But Isaiah declares it
boldly, for he did not speak from
himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Again, since he had predicted that they
would be deprived of courage, in which they excelled, the context requires us to
understand the meaning to be, that they would be struck with blindness; for both
faculties of the soul depend entirely on the favor of God. Consequently,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jwr</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>ruach</i>) means here understanding and sagacity which ought to be carefully
observed, for many are mistaken as to the meaning of this word. When he
immediately adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will destroy
the counsel thereof</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> this is a stronger
expression of the former statement; for it shews what is the cause of that
<i>emptiness,</i> namely, that God will take and carry away their
<i>counsel.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Even though
they seek it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is spoken by anticipation,
for he meets the objections of the Egyptians, who might have said, "Have we not
gods whom we can consult? Have we not magicians, diviners, and soothsayers? Do
you reckon those to be of no value?" He threatens that all these things will be
of no avail to them, to whatever extent they may rely on them, and be puffed up
with the empty name of wisdom. I shall not spend much time on these names,
though it is probable that Isaiah's enumeration proceeds by gradual advancement.
First, he mentions <i>gods,</i> next <i>magicians,</i> and afterwards
<i>diviners</i> and <i>fortune-tellers.</i> They had their oracles, in which
they placed the highest confidence. Next after them came the <i>magicians,</i>
though these too had great influence. In matters of smaller moment they
consulted the soothsayers. Superstitious men are so restless that nothing can
satisfy them; for they are fickle and unsteady, and sometimes resort to one
remedy and sometimes to another; and indeed Satan deceives them in such a
manner, that at first he holds out to them the appearance of peace and
quietness, which they think that they have fully obtained, but afterwards shews
them that they have not reached it, and distresses and harasses them more and
more, and compels them to seek new grounds of confidence. Thus our minds cannot
obtain rest and peace but in God alone. And undoubtedly the Prophet condemns
those arts as contrary to reason; for god has revealed all that is necessary to
be known by means of the arts and sciences, which he intended to be used, and of
which he approves. If any man shall wish to be wise in any other manner, he must
have Satan for his teacher.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will deliver the Egyptians
into the hand of a cruel master.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F285</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He now shews what will happen to the
Egyptians, after having lost courage and been deprived of understanding. Nothing
will be left for them but to be reduced to slavery; for a nation destitute of
these must fall of its own accord, even though it were not violently attacked by
any enemy. Of such aids, therefore, God deprives those on whom he determines to
take vengeance, and shuts them out from every method of upholding their liberty.
Yet the Prophet threatens what is still more shocking, that not only will the
empire of which the Egyptians proudly vaunted fall down, but the inhabitants
also will undergo hard bondage. Though the adjective
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h&ccedil;q</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>kasheh,</i>) <i>cruel,</i> is in the singular number, yet he says in the
plural number, that they shall be subject to <i>lords,</i> which is harder to
endure than if there had been but one lord to whom they were
subject.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And a powerful
king</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F286</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall rule over
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He means that the power of the tyrant to
whom he will subject them shall be so great, that it will not be easy to restore
them to liberty. Historians shew that various changes occurred in many
countries, which they who subdued them were unable to hold and retain; for to
keep what has been obtained is often more difficult than to conquer. But the
Prophet intimates that this condition will not be easily changed, and that the
bondage of the Egyptians shall be of long duration, because no one will dare to
enter the lists with an exceedingly powerful conqueror. We may also understand
the meaning to be, that the princes of smaller nations will deal more gently
with their people than more powerful monarchs, who, relying on their greatness,
allow themselves to do whatever they please; for, reckoning their power to be
unlimited, they set no bounds to their freedom of action, and rush forward,
without restraint, wherever their passions drive them. Whether the one view or
the other be adopted, it will amount to this, that the Egyptians, who consider
themselves to be the highest and most distinguished of all men, shall fall under
the power of another, and shall be oppressed by hard bondage, that is, by the
bondage of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a powerful
king</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> whom no one will dare to oppose.
Hence we see how great is the folly of men who are desirous to have a powerful
and wealthy king reigning over them, and how justly they are punished for their
ambition, though it cannot be corrected by the experience of every day, which is
everywhere to be seen in the world. France and Spain, at the present day, boast
that they are governed by mighty princes, but feel to their cost how little
advantage they derive from that which dazzles them by a false pretense of honor.
But on this subject we have spoken formerly in another
place.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then the waters shall fail from
the sea.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He follows out the subject which he
had already begun, that the fortifications, by which the Egyptians thought that
they were admirably defended, will be of no avail to them. They reckoned
themselves to be invincible, because they were surrounded by the sea, and by the
Nile, and by fortifications; and historians tell us that it was difficult to
gain entrance to them, because the Nile had no mouth, by which they could not
easily prevent ships from landing. They therefore boasted that their situation
was excellent, and that they were strongly fortified by nature, in like manner
as the inhabitants of Venice, at the present day, think that, in consequence of
being surrounded by deep ditches, they are impregnable; but fortresses are
useless, when God has determined to punish
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the brooks of defense shall
be emptied and dried up.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F288</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> What he adds about fortifications is to
the same purpose with what he had stated immediately before. He alludes to the
embankments, which not only restrained the overflowing of the Nile, but
protected the whole country; as if he had said that the embankments will not be
needed, because the Nile will be dried up. Now, it is certain that the Nile was
not laid dry, and yet the Prophet did not foretell what was not accomplished. We
must therefore call to remembrance what we have already said, that on account of
our stupidity those calamities are represented to us in a lively manner, which
places them as it were before our eyes; for we need to have a representation
made to us which is fitted to impress our minds, and to arouse us to consider
the judgments of God, which otherwise we despise. We ought to observe the
haughtiness of the Egyptians, whose resources were so various and abundant, and
who thought that it was impossible for them to be overtaken by such a
calamity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the reed and the rush shall
wither.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He mentions <i>the</i> <i>reed</i> and
<i>the rush,</i> because they had abundance of them, and employed them for
various purposes; or, it may be thought to mean that the marshes will be dried
up.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By the mouth of the
brooks.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some render it <i>embankments,</i> but
it rather means the fountain itself, which seldom is dried up, though torrents
or rivers fail. By </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> therefore, he means the source of
the river which shall be dried up in such a manner that no part of the country
can be watered. Though the source of the Nile was at a great distance, yet not
without reason did the Prophet threaten that that river, on whose waters the
fertility almost of the whole land depended, shall be dried up at its very
source; for in that country rain seldom falls, but its place is supplied every
year by the Nile. If that river overflow but scantily, it threatens scarcity and
famine; and therefore, when the Prophet threatens that it will be dried up, he
means that the whole country will be barren For this reason he says also, that,
even at its very <i>mouth,</i> from which the waters spring up, there will be a
lack of waters, so that in that place the herbs will be
withered.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the fishers shall
mourn.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Isaiah still keeps in his eye the
condition of Egypt. We have formerly
mentioned</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F289</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that the prophets made use of those
figures of speech by which, when any country is mentioned, they chiefly name
those things which abound in that country, and for which it is celebrated. Thus,
when a vinebearing country is spoken of, they mention vines; if it abound in
gold, they speak of gold; and if it abound in silver, they speak of silver.
Accordingly, when he speaks of Egypt, which was well watered, and contained
abundance of streams, he mentions
<i>fishing.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They who
spread a net on the face of the waters shall
languish.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some translate the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wllma</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>amlalu</i>,) "they shall be cut off," but the more correct rendering is,
"they shall be weakened;" for this corresponds to the mourning and lamentation
which was formerly mentioned. Now, we know that in that country there was a
great number of fishers, and that these formed a great part of the wealth of
Egypt. When fishers were taken away, of whom there were vast numbers among the
Egyptians, and of whom their wealth chiefly consisted, they must have been
<i>weakened</i>. Now, if the nation be deprived of that which is its ordinary
food, great poverty will follow. He therefore describes an astonishing change
that shall pass on the whole country.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they who work in the finest
flax.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As he spoke of mourning so he now speaks
of shame; for they who formerly earned an abundant livelihood by this trade will
have no gains. Now, the two occupations are closely connected, to weave nets and
to fish. Yet it is doubtful if he speaks of those only who manufactured nets;
for if we understand
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twqyr&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>serikoth</i>) to mean certain very fine linens, it is probable that the
latter clause relates to other productions of the loom, manufactured out of
small fine thread, and of the most elegant workmanship. We know that linens of
very great value were woven in Egypt, and there may be good reason for
interpreting the phrase <i>white nets,</i> or, as we have rendered it,
"perforated," to mean also linen garments, which were more costly in proportion
to the greater delicacy of their texture.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It
will thus be a metaphorical expression, by which the Prophet indirectly taunts
them with their unbecoming luxury, alleging that the Egyptians cover themselves
with linen garments in the same manner as if they clothed themselves with a net.
If this meaning be adopted, it will agree with the following verse; and indeed I
do not see how such exquisite skill in weaving can be applied to fishing. But if
it be thought better to understand the whole as relating to fishes, the meaning
will be, that they who had been much employed in fishing, and had found it to be
a profitable occupation, will be overwhelmed with
sorrow.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

(<i>secher,</i>) there is no absolute necessity, in my opinion, for translating
it <i>a net;</i> for the derivation shews it, on the contrary, to denote a
lucrative occupation.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F291</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">Where
fishes are very abundant, they are also preserved in pools and ponds; because
the fishers would otherwise be constrained to sell them at a very low price.
Besides, when they throw a net, they are not always successful. He therefore
follows out the same subject, "It will not be possible either to take or to
preserve fishes. Pools will be of no
use."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Surely the princes of Zoan are
fools.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he joins wisdom with folly, and not
without reason; for it is impossible to take away from men a conviction of their
wisdom, which leads them to believe, in opposition to God himself, that they are
wise. It is therefore a kind of acknowledgment, when he calls those persons wise
whom he at the same time accuses of folly or stupidity. Though the Hebrew
particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#176;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>ach,</i>) sometimes means <i>but,</i> yet as the Prophet appears to attack
the Egyptians, I choose rather to render it "surely," or "truly," or "now at
least;" for he scoffs </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>at the
counselors of Pharaoh</i></font><font face="Palatino"> for wishing to be
regarded, and believing themselves to be, exceeding wise, though they are the
most foolish of all men. Thus it is an exclamation: "Where is that wisdom of
Egypt? Where are the counselors who held all men in contempt? Why do they not
preserve their kingdom?" Now, at least, it is evident what kind of wisdom they
had. This tends to confirm and seal the prophecy, in which the Prophet obviously
does not speak of things unknown, but has before his eyes, as it were, the
destruction of Egypt. "Armed therefore with the authority of God, I venture to
pronounce all those princes to be fools, though they think that they are
wise."</font><br><font face="Palatino">Finally, the Prophet shews that vain is
the glory of men who, without God, claim for themselves even a spark of wisdom;
because their folly is at length exposed, and when the actual trial comes, they
shew that they are children. he Lord permits them, indeed, to achieve many
exploits, that they may obtain reputation among men, but in the end he
infatuates them, so that, notwithstanding their sagacity and long experience,
they act more foolishly than children. Let us therefore learn to seek from the
Lord the spirit of wisdom and counsel, and if he shall bestow it upon us, let us
use it with propriety and moderation; for God opposes the wisdom of men when
they claim more than they have a right to claim, and those who are too ambitious
to exalt themselves, must be punished for their folly; and therefore he often
puts them to shame, that it may be made manifest that their wisdom is nothing
but empty smoke. There is no wisdom but that which is founded on the fear of
God, which Solomon also declares to be the chief part of wisdom.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;200107&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
1:7; 9:10.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How say ye to
Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He reproves the counsellors of Pharaoh for
flattering him, as courtiers are wont to flatter princes; for they utter nothing
but what is intended to soothe and gratify the ears of princes, because this is
the way by which they succeed and obtain favor. Thus, amidst many flatteries and
lies, there is no room for truth. Though this vice is commonly found in the
courts of great princes, yet at that time it abounded chiefly among the
Egyptians. They boasted that they were the most ancient of all nations, and that
they were the inventors of the arts, and of all liberal education; and if such a
conviction existed even among the common people, how much stronger must it have
been in the kings themselves?</font><br><font face="Palatino">The boasting
related to two points, antiquity and knowledge; and Isaiah reproves both, or at
least says that they will be of no value. Pharaoh boasted both of the antiquity
and of the wisdom of his nation; and indeed this was common among the whole
people; but he speaks chiefly of the king as the head, in whom this haughtiness
was more conspicuous than among ordinary persons. Now, we ought not to boast of
the wisdom of our ancestors, as if it belonged to us by hereditary right, but we
must look to heaven and ask it from its Author. So far as relates to antiquity,
it is a foolish and idle boast; and yet princes are so deeply infected by this
vice, that they would willingly seek their birth and descent out of the world,
and cannot easily be drawn away from that vanity. This madness is heightened by
flatterers, who have contrived, as we perceive, many things about the genealogy
of certain princes. No song is more delightful to them than when they are
separated from the common herd of men, like demigods or heroes. But it
frequently happens, that when they carry their curiosity to excess in inquiring
about their grandfathers and great-grandfathers, they lay themselves open to
ridicule, because it is found that they are descended from one of the common
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino">I have heard an amusing anecdote,
related by persons worthy of credit, about the Emperor Maximilian, who was very
eager to inquire into his descent, and was induced by a silly trifler to believe
that he had traced his lineage to Noah's ark. This subject made so powerful an
impression on his mind, that he left off all business, applied himself earnestly
to this single investigation, and would allow no one to draw him away from it,
not even the ambassadors who came to treat with him about important matters. All
were astonished at this folly, and silently blamed him for it, but no one had
power or courage to suggest a remedy. At length his cook, who was likewise his
jester, and often entertained him with his sayings, asked leave to speak, and,
as one who was desirous to uphold the Emperor's dignity, told him that this
eagerness to trace his descent would neither be useful nor honorable; for, said
he, at present I revere your majesty, and worship you as a god; but if we must
come to Noah's ark, there we shall all be cousins, for we are all descended from
it. Maximilian was so deeply affected by this saying of the jester, that he
became ashamed of his undertaking, though formerly neither friends, nor
counsellors, nor business could dissuade him from it; for he perceived that his
name which he wished to render more illustrious by inquiring into his remote
ancestors, would be altogether degraded if they came to its earliest source,
from which princes and peasants, nobles and artisans, are
descended.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What is blamed even by jesters and
fools must be great madness; and yet it is not a vice which has lately sprung
up, but is deeply rooted in the minds of almost all men. In order to avoid it,
let us learn to depend on God alone, and let us prefer the blessedness of
adoption to all riches, and lineage, and nobility. So far as relates to the
kings of Egypt being descended from very ancient kings, who had kept possession
of the throne for many ages, they were as proud as if wisdom had been born with
them.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

Where are thy wise men? that they may tell
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Though literally it runs thus, "And they
shall tell thee, and shall know," yet the word ought to be regarded as meaning,
"that they may tell thee, and even that at length they may know; " for this mode
of expression is frequently employed by the Hebrews. The Egyptians had their
diviners from whom they thought that nothing, however secret, was concealed; for
they consulted them about the smallest and greatest affairs, and held their
replies to be oracles. The Prophet, mocking that vanity, says, "How shall they
tell what they do not know? Have they been admitted to the counsel of God?" It
is also probable that he condemns the art which they used in divination, because
it was not only unlawful, but also made use of absolute tricks and
deceptions.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There are three ways in which we may
foresee or know what is future. The first and chief way is, by the revelation of
the Spirit, which alone can make us certain, as by the gift of prophecy, which
is rare and uncommon. The second is, by astronomy. The third is, by a comparison
of past events, from which prudence is commonly
obtained</font><br><font face="Palatino">As to a knowledge of the stars, from
their position and conjunction, some things may occasionally be learned, such as
famine, scarcity, pestilence, abundant harvests, and things of that sort; but
even these cannot be certain, for they rest on mere conjecture. Now, we ought
always to consider what relation the stars bear to these lower regions; for the
actions of men are not regulated by them, as idle and false astrologers imagine,
a vast number of whom, at the present day, endeavor to insinuate themselves into
the minds of princes and subjects, as if they possessed a knowledge of
everything, both present and future. Such men resemble the impostors of whom the
Prophet speaks, who deceive men by their jugglery. Yet princes lend an attentive
ear to such persons, and receive them as gods; and indeed they deserve to be
thus imposed upon, and are justly punished for their
curiosity.</font><br><font face="Palatino">They likewise boast of magic, in
which those Egyptian diviners were skilled. But they add many things which are
worse, and more abominable, exorcisms and calling on devils, than which nothing
more destructive can be expressed or conceived. The Lord pronounces a curse on
such conjectures and arts of divination, and the issue of them cannot but be
disastrous and wretched. And if they were formerly condemned in the Egyptians,
how much more do they deserve condemnation in those who use the name of God as a
pretext? It is wonderful that men otherwise acute and sagacious should be so
childishly deceived by such jugglery, so that they appear to be deprived of
understanding and judgment; but it is the Lord's righteous vengeance, who
punishes the wickedness of men.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Again, when from
past events we calculate what is future, and judge by experience and observation
what is most proper to be done, that cannot in itself be blamed; but neither can
we by these means learn with certainty what is future, for the matter always
lies in conjecture. Yet Isaiah directly attacks that sagacity which is
universally applauded as something highly excellent, not because it is in itself
sinful, but because we can scarcely find an acute or ingenious person who does
not confidently believe that his skill places within his reach all that deserves
or is necessary to be known. In this manner they despise the secret providence
of God, as if nothing were hidden from
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What the Lord of hosts
hath decreed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There is still another vice, that
craftiness and sleight of hand are preferred by them to true wisdom. But Isaiah
expressly censures that pride which led men endued with great abilities to
measure events by their own judgment, as if the government of the world were not
in the hand of God; and therefore with their divination he contrasts the
heavenly decree. And hence learn how skillfully Isocrates says,
"</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Kra&gt;tiston ei+nai para&lt;

success, and the best gift from ourselves is
prudence."</font><br><font face="Palatino">At first sight, this maxim of the
elegant orator appears beautiful; but since he robs God of the spirit of
prudence and bestows it on mortals, the distribution is both wicked and foolish,
to ascribe to men sound counsel, and to leave nothing to God but prosperous
fortune. Now, if any one neglect the methods by which God teaches us, and resort
to Satan's impostures, he richly deserves to be deceived and involved in the
greatest disgrace; for he seeks remedies that are nowhere to be found, and
despises those which were offered by
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>

It ought, I think, to be viewed as referring to those wise men by whom the
Egyptians supposed themselves to be so powerfully defended that no evil could
befall them. But Isaiah says that this is too feeble a support, because, having
been deceived in their counsels, they ruined Egypt; and therefore he holds up to
mockery that pretended wisdom which, when it is not accompanied by the fear of
God, ought to be called vanity and folly, and not wisdom. Not only do men abuse
an excellent gift of God, but they are puffed up with vain ambition, and are
more delighted with cunning than with real prudence. To this is added a devilish
fury, which leads them to disregard the providence of God, and to bring down all
events to the level of their own capacity. This is the reason why Scripture so
frequently attacks wise men of that description, and declares that they are
fools. They usurp what belongs to God, and claim it for themselves; which is
shocking and intolerable sacrilege. We need not wonder if the Lord make fearful
displays against such wise men, so that with all their great acuteness and
ingenuity they stumble and fall in the smallest matters, and run into great
dangers which any peasant or artisan would have foreseen. Let these things be a
warning to us, that we may not be elated or lay claim to the praise of wisdom.
If we have any abilities or prudence, we ought to ascribe it wholly to God, and
conform ourselves to the rule of sobriety and modesty; for if our wisdom rest on
God he will truly be a steadfast corner-stone, which no one shall shake or
overthrow.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The </i>Lord<i> hath mingled
a spirit of perverseness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Because it was a
thing unexpected and incredible that the leaders of a sagacious and prudent
nation would destroy the country by their stupidity, the Prophet therefore
ascribes it to the judgment of God, that the Jews may not shut their eyes
against an example so striking and remarkable, as irreligious men usually
attribute the judgments of God to chance when anything new or unexpected has
happened. The expression is metaphorical, as if one were to mix wine in a cup,
that the Lord thus intoxicates the wise men of this world so that they are
stunned and amazed, and can neither think nor act aright. The consequence is,
that they deceive Egypt, because, first, they were themselves deceived. That the
Egyptians suffer themselves to be imposed on, and cannot guard against the
deception, is the judgment of the Lord.</font><br><font face="Palatino">And yet
Isaiah does not represent God to be the Author of this folly in such a manner
that the Egyptians could impute blame to him, but eve ought to view the matter
in this light: "Men have in themselves no understanding or judgment, for whence
comes wisdom but from the Spirit of God, who is the only fountain of light,
understanding, and truth? Now, if the Lord withhold his Spirit from us, what
right have we to dispute with him? He is under no obligations to us, and all
that he bestows is actually a free gift." Yet when he strikes the minds of men
with a </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirit of
giddiness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> he does it always for good
reasons, though they are sometimes concealed from us. But very frequently he
punishes with blindness those wicked men who have risen up against him, as
happened to those Egyptians who, puffed up with a conviction of their wisdom,
swelled with pride and despised all other men. It is therefore superfluous to
dispute here about predestination, for the Lord punishes them for open vice;
and, accordingly, when God blinds men or gives them over to a reprobate mind,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:28,) he cannot be accused of cruelty; for it is the just punishment of their
wickedness and licentiousness, and he who acts justly in punishing
transgressions cannot be called the Author of
sin.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Let us now attend to the manner of
punishing. He delivers them up to Satan to be punished, for he it is, strictly
speaking, that mingles the spirit of giddiness and perverseness; but as he does
nothing but by the command of God, it is therefore said that God does what Satan
does. The statement commonly made, that it is done by God's permission, is an
excessively frivolous evasion; for the Prophet has expressed more than this,
namely, that this punishment was inflicted by God, because he is a righteous
judge. God therefore acts by means of Satan, as a judge by means of an
executioner, and inflicts righteous punishment on those who have offended him.
Thus in the book of Kings we read that Satan presented himself before God, and
asked leave to deceive Ahab's prophets; and having obtained it, he then obeyed
the command of God, for he could have done nothing by himself. It is unnecessary
to produce a multitude of quotations in a matter so
obvious.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they have misled
Egypt in all her work.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When he adds that her
counsellors <i>deceived</i> her, he points out a second judgment of God; for it
might have happened that the princes were deprived of understanding, and
resembled <i>drunkards,</i> and yet the common people continued to possess some
judgment; but here he says, that the impostors obtained also the power of
leading astray so as to deceive the people. This is a two-fold vengeance of God,
both on them that lead astray, and on those who are led astray by
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As a drunken man
staggereth in his vomit.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By a <i>vomit</i> He
means shameful drunkenness. This is added
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pro&lt;v
au]xhsin</font><font face="Palatino">) by way of amplification. in order to shew
that they were not ordinary drunkards, who have still some understanding left,
but that they resembled swine.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Neither shall Egypt have any work
to do.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is the conclusion of the former
statement, for it means that all the Egyptians shall be stupefied to such a
degree that whatever they undertake shall be fruitless. This must happen where
there is no counsel, and it is the righteous punishment of our pride and
rashness. He therefore intended to describe the result and effect, so as to shew
that it will be unhappy and
miserable.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Head or tail,
branch or rush.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When he threatens both the
<i>head</i> and the <i>tail</i>, he means, that all ranks, from the highest to
the lowest, all without exception, shall be deprived of counsel, so that they
will not succeed in anything. Or perhaps it will be thought rather to mean the
order which they observe in their actions. Hence we learn, that both the
beginning and the end of everything depend on God; for we ought to ask from him
counsel, and prudence, and success, if we do not wish that the same thing should
happen to us which happened to the
Egyptians.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
In that day shall Egypt be like women.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He again
repeats what he had formerly said, that the Egyptians will have nothing that is
manly. Some think that he alludes to an effeminate custom, on account of which
the ancient historians censured the Egyptians, namely, that, by inverting the
order of things, women appeared in public and transacted the affairs of state,
and men performed the occupations of women. It is possible that the Prophet may
have had this in his eye, but when I take a more careful view of the whole
passage, this conjecture cannot be admitted; for here he threatens a judgment of
God, which will hold up men to astonishment. If he were speaking of an ordinary
custom, this would not apply to the matter in hand, for he does not charge the
hearts of the Egyptians with being effeminate, but, on the contrary, threatens
that they shall be struck with such dread that in no respect will they differ
from women. The Egyptians not only thought that they were able to maintain war,
but attacked without provocation, and gave aid to other nations. We see that
heathen writers relate many of the exploits of the Egyptians, and expatiate
largely on their praises; and, therefore, although the Egyptians were feeble and
effeminate in comparison with other nations, yet they wished to retain the
praise and renown of warlike
men.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because of the shaking of
the hand of Jehovah of hosts.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F296</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The sudden change which is now effected
is a striking display of the judgment of heaven, and therefore he adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the shaking of the hand of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"> will be the cause of the terror. By these
words he shews that this war will be entirely carried on by the Lord, and
therefore that the Egyptians cannot stand against it, because they have not to
do with men. What Isaiah declares concerning Egypt ought to be likewise applied
to other nations; for if wars arise and insurrections spring up, we ought to
acknowledge it to be a judgment of God when men lose courage and are overwhelmed
with terror. We see how the most warlike nations give way, and shew themselves
to be less courageous than women, and are vanquished without any preparations of
war, whenever the Lord strikes their minds with
dread.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the land of Judah shall be a
terror to the Egyptians.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some explain it simply
to mean, that the land of Judah will be an astonishment to the Egyptians as well
as to other nations, and compare this passage with the saying which has formerly
come under our observation, "You shall be an
astonishment."</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F297</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But I think that the meaning of the
Prophet here is different, for he intended to point out the reason why the Lord
would make such a display against the Egyptians. It was because they had brought
destruction on the Jews, for they had turned them aside from the confidence
which they ought to have placed in God, as princes frequently solicit their
neighbors, and offer them their aid, that they may afterwards make use of them
for their own advantage. Now the Lord had forbidden them
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051716&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
17:16) to resort to the Egyptians for the purpose of asking assistance from
them; but those wretched people, instead of obeying God, listened to the
solicitation of unbelievers who made offers to them, and on this account they
were justly punished.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But the Egyptians also,
who had given occasion to their unbelief and distrust, did not pass unpunished,
for they were so sharply chastised that whenever they remembered the Jews they
were overwhelmed with terror. Hence we ought to draw a profitable doctrine, that
they who have turned aside the Church from obeying and trusting in God, and who,
by fear, or counsel, or any enticements, have given occasion for offense, will
be severely punished. The meaning of the Prophet's words is as if we should say,
that the look of a woman will bring a blush on him who has seduced hen when the
disgrace of the uncleanness shall have been laid open, and when God shall come
forth as the avenger of conjugal
fidelity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that day there shall be five
cities.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> After having threatened the Egyptians,
and at the same time explained the reason of the divine judgment, he comforts
them, and promises the mercy of God. He declares that they will be in part
restored and will regain a prosperous and flourishing condition; for he says
that out of six <i>cities five</i> will be saved, and only one will perish. He
had already foretold a frightful destruction to the whole kingdom, so that no
one who examines the former prediction can think of anything else than a
condition that is past remedy. He therefore promises that this restoration will
be accomplished by the extraordinary kindness of God, so that it will be a kind
of addition to the redemption of the Church, or a large measure of the grace of
God, when the Redeemer shall be sent.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The manner
of expression is somewhat obscure, but if we observe it carefully, there is no
difficulty about the meaning; for the Prophet means that on1y the sixth part of
the cities will be destroyed, and that the rest will be saved. The difficulty
lies in the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">srhh</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>haheres</i>.) Some read it
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">srjh</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>hacheres</i>,) that is, <i>of</i> <i>the sun</i>, but they have mistaken the
letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>he</i>) for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">j</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>cheth</i>,) which resembles it. Those who explain it <i>"of the</i>
<i>sun,"</i> think that the Prophet spoke of
Heliopolis;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F298</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but this does not agree with the
context; and he does not merely promise that <i>five</i> <i>cities</i> would be
restored, (for how inconsiderable would such a restoration have been!) but
generally, that <i>five</i> cities out of six would be saved. We know that the
cities in Egypt were very numerous. I do not mention the fables of the ancients,
and those who have assigned to them twenty thousand cities. But still, there
must have been a vast number of cities in a country so highly celebrated, in a
kingdom so flourishing and populous, with a climate so mild and temperate. Let
us then suppose that there were a thousand cities in it, or somewhat more. He
says that only the sixth part will perish, that the rest will be restored, so
that but few will be destroyed. From what follows it is evident that this
restoration must be understood to relate to the
worship.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Speaking with the lip
of Canaan.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By the word <i>lip</i> he means the
<i>tongue</i>,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sunekdocikw~v</font><font face="Palatino">,)
taking a part for the whole. He expresses their agreement with the people of
God, and the faith by which they will make profession of the name of God; for by
the <i>tongue</i> he metaphorically describes confession. Since there was but
one language which acknowledged and professed the true God, that is, the
language of that nation which inhabited the land of Canaan, it is evident that
by such a language must be meant agreement in religion. It is customary enough
to employ these modes of expression, "to speak the same language," or, "to speak
a different language," when we intend to describe agreement or diversity of
opinion. But at the same time it must be remembered that it is not every kind of
agreement that is sufficient, as if men were to form a conspiracy about the
worship which they preferred, but if they agree in the truth which was revealed
to the fathers. He does not merely say that the Egyptians will speak the same
language, but that they will speak the language <i>of Canaan</i>. They must have
changed their language, and adopted that which God had sanctified; not that the
dialect was more holy, but it is commended on account of its containing the
doctrine of truth.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This ought to be carefully
observed, that we may understand what is the true method of agreement. We must
by all means seek harmony, but we must see on what conditions we obtain it; for
we must not seek any middle course, as is done by those who overturn religion,
and yet who wish to be regarded as peace-makers. Away with such fickle and
changeful tongues! Let the truth itself be preserved, which cannot be contained
but in the word. Whosoever shall determine to agree to it, let him talk with us,
but away with every one who shall corrupt it, choose what language he may. Let
us abide firmly by this. It will therefore be impossible for the Egyptians to
speak the language of Canaan till they have first relinquished their own
language, that is, till they have relinquished all superstitions. Some refer
this to the age of Ptolemy, but it is absurd, and we may infer from what follows
that the Prophet speaks of piety and of the true worship of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And swearing by Jehovah
of hosts.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> First, employing a figure of speech
in which a part is taken for the whole, he shews that their conversation will be
holy, by exhibiting a single class of them, for in <i>swearing</i> they will
make profession that they worship the true God. It may also be read,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>swearing to the
LORD</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or, <i>by the</i> LORD,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>lamed</i>) often signifies <i>by</i>. If we read, "to the Lord," the meaning
will be, that they will promise obedience to him, and that by a solemn oath, as
when any nation promises fidelity to its prince; as if he had said, "They will
acknowledge the authority of God, and submit to his government." But since
another reading has been more generally approved, I willingly adopt it; for
since one part of the worship of God is <i>swearing</i>, by taking a part for
the whole, as I have said, it fitly describes the whole of the worship of God.
Again, to "swear by the Lord" often means to testify that he is the true God.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050613&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
6:13.) In a word, it denotes a perfect agreement with the Church of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we ought to learn that outward
confession is a necessary part of the true worship of God; for if any person
wish to keep his faith shut up in his heart, he will have but a cold regard for
it.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451009&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:9,10.) True faith breaks out into confession, and kindles us to such a degree
that we actually profess what we inwardly feel. "To me," says the Lord in
another passage, "every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall swear."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234523&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
45:23.) Accordingly, there ought to be an outward worship and outward profession
wherever faith dwells. It ought also to be observed, that those things which
belong to the worship of God ought not to be applied to any other purpose, and
therefore it is a profanation of an oath if we swear by any other. It is
written, "Thou shalt swear by my name."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050613&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
6:13.) Accordingly, he is insulted and robbed of his honor, if the name of
saints, or of any creature, be employed in an oath. Let it likewise be observed
with what solemnity oaths should be made; for if by swearing we profess to
worship God, we ought never to engage in it but with fear and
reverence.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>One shall be called
the city of desolation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When he devotes to
destruction every sixth city, he means that all who are not converted to God, so
as to worship him, perish without hope of salvation; for he contrasts the cities
of Egypt which shall begin to acknowledge God with those which are destined to
destruction. Where the worship of God is wanting, nothing but destruction can
remain behind.

altar in the midst of the land of Egypt.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He
continues what he had said in the former verse, and states more clearly that the
aspect of Egypt will be renewed, because there true religion will flourish, the
pure worship of God will be set up, and all superstitions will fall to the
ground. He employs the word <i>altar</i> to denote, as by a sign, the worship of
God; for sacrifices and oblations were the outward acts of piety. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the midst of
Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he means the chief part of the whole
kingdom, as if he had said, "in the very metropolis," or, "in the very heart of
the kingdom."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And a

of piety; for he means that they will be marks similar to those which point out
the boundaries of kingdoms, and that in this manner signs will be evident, to
make known to all men that God rules over this nation. And indeed it usually
happens that a nation truly converted to God, after having laid aside idols and
superstitions, openly sets up signs of the true religion, that all may know that
the worship of God is purely observed in
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Josephus relates (Ant. 13. 3. 1,) that Onias
perverted this passage, when he fled to Ptolemy Philometor,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F300</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
whom he persuaded that it would be advantageous to erect an altar there, on
which the Jews who dwelt in that country might sacrifice; and he brought forward
this passage, alleging that what the Prophet had foretold ought to be
accomplished. The wicked and ambitious priest persuaded the king to do this,
though it was openly opposed by the Jews; for the king looked to his own
advantage, and that scoundrel, who had been deprived of his rank, sought to
obtain additional honor and advancement; so that no entreaty could prevent the
execution of that wicked counsel. But Isaiah simply describes the pure worship
of God under the figure of signs which were then in use; for he has his eye upon
his own age and the men with whom he had to do. This passage, therefore, was
wickedly and maliciously perverted by Onias.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But
not less impudently do the Popish doctors of the present day torture a passage
in Malachi to defend the sacrifice of the Mass. When he says that "a pure
oblation will everywhere be offered to God,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;390111&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
1:11,) they infer that it is some sacrifice different from the ancient
sacrifices, because oxen and sheep must no longer be sacrificed, and therefore
that it is the Mass. A witty and ingenious argument truly! Now, it is evident
that under the legal figure Malachi describes nothing else than the pure worship
of God, as Isaiah does here; and we ought carefully to observe such forms of
expression, which are frequently employed by the
prophets.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This will be clearly explained by a
passage in Joel, which we shall quote as an example. "Your sons and your
daughters," says he, "shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and
your old men shall dream dreams."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;290228&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joel
2:28.) Peter shews
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;440216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
2:16) that this prediction was fulfilled, when the apostles spoke various
languages through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Having formerly been
uneducated men, they began to be qualified for declaring the mysteries of God.
On that occasion we perceive no "dreams," so that it might be thought that Peter
quoted that passage inappropriately; but it is evident that Joel there describes
nothing else than prophecy, and for the purpose of adorning it, he mentioned
"visions and dreams," by means of which the Lord anciently held communication
with the prophets.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;041206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
12:6.) He kept in view the ordinary custom of that age; for otherwise the Jews
would have found it difficult to comprehend the gifts of the Spirit which at
that time were unknown. Having been reared under that preparatory instruction of
the Law,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F301</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
they could rise no higher than where they were conducted by sacrifices,
ceremonies, sacraments, and signs.

So then the prophets addressed them as children, who ought to have nothing set
before them beyond what they can learn in a homely style
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pacumere&gt;steron</font><font face="Palatino">)
by custom and experience.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This doctrine will
unfold to us various passages, the obscurity of which might lead to much
hesitation. It is plain that the Prophet speaks of the kingdom of Christ, and
that these things were not fulfilled before his coming. We must therefore take
away the shadows and look at the reality of things, in order that by the
<i>altar</i> we may understand a true and sincere calling on God. But by these
signs the Prophet likewise shews that the worship of God cannot be maintained
without external acts of devotion, though we have no right to lay down rules for
them. Away with the inventions of men, that we may listen to God alone on this
subject.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he will send them a
Savior.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We cannot serve God unless he first
bestow his grace upon us; for no one will dedicate himself to God, till he be
drawn by his goodness, and embrace him with all his heart. He must therefore
call us to him before we call upon him; we can have no access till he first
invite us. Formerly he shewed that they must be subdued by various afflictions
in order that they may submit to God, and now he repeats the same thing; for men
never deny themselves and forsake idle follies any farther than the scourge
compels them to yield obedience. But he likewise adds another kind of
invitation, that, having experienced the kindness of God, they will freely
approach to Him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They will cry
unto the Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The <i>cry</i> of which he
speaks proceeds from faith, for they would never resort to this refuge till they
had been allured and delighted by the goodness of God. When the Lord promises
that he will send a <i>Savior</i>, by whose hand the Egyptians will be
delivered, this can mean no other than Christ; for Egypt was not delivered from
its distresses before the doctrine of Christ reached it. We read of various
changes which that country suffered for four hundred years, foreign and civil
wars by which it was wasted and almost destroyed; but when we would be ready to
think that it is utterly ruined, lo! it is converted to the Lord, and is rescued
from the hand of enemies and tyrants. Thus Christ delivered that country, when
it had begun to know him. In like manner, we must be brought to the knowledge
and worship of God, that, where we have suffered various afflictions, we may
learn that salvation is found in him alone. Would that the world would now learn
this lesson, having suffered so many calamities that it appears to be on the
brink of ruin! For what can be the issue but that it shall either perish or by
repentance acknowledge that it has been justly punished for so great
wickedness?</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That he may
deliver them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When he adds these words, we
ought to draw from them a profitable doctrine, that God assists us through
Christ, by whose agency he gave deliverance to his own people from the
beginning. He has always been the Mediator, by whose intercession all blessings
were obtained from God the Father; and now that he has been revealed, let us
learn that nothing can be obtained from God but through
him.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F303</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord shall be known
by the Egyptians.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Isaiah now adds what was most
important; for we cannot worship the Lord, or call upon him, till we have first
acknowledged him to be our Father. "How," says Paul, "shall they call on him
whom they know not?"</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

previously having true knowledge, which is by faith. He therefore properly adds,
the knowledge of God, as the foundation of all religion, or the key that opens
to us the gate of the heavenly kingdom. Now, there cannot be knowledge without
doctrine; and hence infer, that God disapproves of all kinds of false worship;
for he cannot approve of anything that is not guided by knowledge, which springs
from hearing true and pure doctrine. Whatever contrivance therefore men may make
out of their own minds, they will never attain by it the true worship of God. We
ought carefully to observe passages like this, in which the Spirit of God shews
what is the true worship and calling of God, that, having abandoned the
inventions to which men are too obstinately attached, we may allow ourselves to
be taught by the pure word of God, and, relying on his authority, may freely and
boldly condemn all that the world applauds and
admires.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Egyptians shall

explained in the same manner as the former, in which he mentioned an
<i>altar</i>. What would have been the use of sacrifices after the manifestation
of Christ? He therefore describes metaphorically confession of faith and calling
on God, which followed the preaching of the gospel. Here he includes everything
that was offered to God &#8212; slain beasts, bread, fruits of every
description, and all that was fitted to express gratitude. But we must attend to
the difference between the Old and New Testaments, and under the shadows of
ceremonies we must understand to be meant that "reasonable worship" of which
Paul speaks.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
12:1.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And shall vow vows to
the Lord and perform them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What he adds about
<i>vows</i> is likewise a part of the worship of God. The Jews were accustomed
to express their gratitude to God by <i>vows</i>, and especially they rendered
thanksgiving by a solemn vow, when they had received from God any extraordinary
blessing. Of their own accord also, when any one chose to do so, they made
<i>vows</i> on various occasions.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
12:6; 23:21-23.) And yet every person was not at liberty to make this or that
vow according to his own pleasure; but a rule was laid down.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;043003&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
30:3.) Whatever may be in that respect, it is evident that by the word
<i>vows</i> the Prophet means nothing else than the worship of God, to which the
Egyptians devoted themselves after having learned it from the word of God; but
he mentions the acts of devotion by which the Jews made profession of the true
worship and religion.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence the Papists draw an
argument to prove, that whatever we vow to God ought to be performed; but since
they make vows at random, and without any exercise of judgment, this passage
lends no aid to defend their error. Isaiah foretells what the Egyptians will do,
after having embraced and followed the instruction given by
God.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F305</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In like manner, when David exhorts the
people to vow and to perform their vows,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197611&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
76:11,) they think that he is on their side; but be does not therefore exhort
them to make unlawful and rash vows.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;210502&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ecclesiastes
5:2.) There always remains in force the law of vows, which we are not at liberty
to transgress, namely, the word of God, by which we learn what he requires from
us, and what he wishes us to vow and perform. We never received permission to
vow whatever we please, because we are too much disposed to go to excess, and to
take every kind of liberty with regard to God, and because we act more
imprudently towards him than if we had to deal with men. It was therefore
necessary that men should be laid under some restraint to prevent them from
taking so great liberties in the worship of God and
religion.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This being the case, it is evident
that God permits nothing but what is agreeable to his law, and that he rejects
everything else as unacceptable and superstitious. What a man has vowed of his
own accord, and without the support of the word, cannot be binding. If he
perform it, he offends doubly; first, in vowing rashly, as if he were sporting
with God; and secondly, in executing his resolutions wickedly and rashly, when
he ought rather to have set them aside and repented. So far, therefore, is any
man from being bound by vows, that he ought, on the contrary, to turn back and
acknowledge his sinful rashness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, if any one
inquire about the vows of Papists, it will be easy to shew that they derive no
support from the word of God. If those things which they highly applaud and
reckon to be lawful, such as the vows of monks, are unlawful and wicked, what
opinion must we form of the rest? They vow perpetual celibacy, as if it were
indiscriminately permitted to all; but we know that the gift of continence is
not an ordinary gift, and is not promised to every one, not even to those who in
other respects are endued with extraordinary graces. Abraham was eminent for
faith, steadfastness, meekness, and holiness, and yet he did not possess this
gift.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011129&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
11:29; 25:1.) Christ himself, when the apostles loudly commended this state of
celibacy, testified that it is not given to all.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401911&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
19:11,12.) Paul states the same thing.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460707&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 7:7,9,26.) Whosoever, therefore, does not possess this gift of
continence, if he vow it, does wrong, and will be justly punished for his
rashness. Hence have arisen dreadful instances of want of chastity, by which God
has justly punished Popery for this
presumption.</font><br><font face="Palatino">They likewise vow poverty, as if
they would have nothing of their own, though they have abundance of everything
beyond other men. Is not this an open mockery of God? The obedience which they
vow is full of deceit; for they shake off the yoke of Christ, that they may
become the slaves of men. Others vow pilgrimages, to abstain from eating flesh,
to observe days, and other things full of superstition. Others promise to God
toys and trinkets, as if they were dealing with a child. We would be ashamed to
act thus, or to pursue such a line of conduct towards men, among whom nothing is
settled till it has been agreed to on both sides by mutual consent. Much less is
it lawful to attempt anything in the worship of God but what has been declared
by his word. What kind of worship will it be, if the judgment of God has no
weight with us, and if we yield only to the will of men? Will it be possible
that it can please God? Will it not be
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejqeloqrhskei&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">)
"will-worship," which Paul so severely censures?
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;510202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:23.) In vain, therefore, do they who make such vows boast that they serve God;
and in vain do they endeavor to find support in this passage; for the Lord
abhors that kind of worship.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore Jehovah will smite
Egypt.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> From what has been already said the
Prophet draws the conclusion, that the chastisement which he has mentioned will
be advantageous to the Egyptians, because it will be a preparation for their
conversion;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F306</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as if he had said, that it will be for
the good of Egypt that the Lord will punish her. Those who translate the words,
"he will strike with a wound that may be healed," misinterpret this passage, and
greatly weaken the Prophet's meaning; for it means that the wounds will be
advantageous to them, and that by means of these wounds the Lord will bring them
back. Hence we ought to conclude, that we must not refuse to be chastised by
God, for it is done for our benefit.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;200311&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
3:11, 12;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581205&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
12:5-7.) Exemption from punishment would cherish a disposition to sin with less
control. As men are exceedingly prone to give way to their own inclinations,
whenever God spares them for a little, it is necessary on this account that the
Lord should prevent this danger, which he does by chastisements and stripes,
which excite and arouse us to repentance. A remarkable instance of this is here
exhibited in Egypt, which abounded in superstitions and wickedness, and went
beyond all nations in idolatry, and yet experienced the mercy of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For they shall be turned
to Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We must attend to the manner of its
accomplishment, which is, their conversion to God. It is the explanation of the
former clause; as if he had said, "God will heal the Egyptians, because they
shall be converted." The copulative
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>vau</i>) signifies <i>for</i>. Hence we infer that conversion may be said to
be a resurrection from eternal death. We are utterly ruined so long as we are
turned away from God; but when we are converted, we return to his favor, and are
delivered from death; not that we deserve the favor of God by our repentance,
but because in this manner God raises us up, as it were, from death to life. To
repentance is added a promise, from which we conclude, that when we sincerely
repent,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F307</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> we do not in vain implore forgiveness.
Now, when the Prophet says that the Lord will be gracious and reconciled to the
Egyptians, he at the same time shews, that as soon as they have been converted,
they will obtain forgiveness. It will therefore be a true conversion when it is
followed by a calling on God. But without faith
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451014&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:14) it is impossible to call on God; for even the ungodly may acknowledge
sin; but no man will have recourse to the mercy of God, or obtain
reconciliation, till he be moved by a true feeling of repentance, which is
likewise accompanied by
faith.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And will heal
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He does not repeat what he had said, that
God strikes in order to <i>heal;</i> but he promises <i>healing</i> in another
sense, that is, that God will cease to inflict punishments. The former healing,
which he mentioned a little before, was internal; but the latter relates to
stripes and wounds. In short, he means that it will be a speedy remedy for all
their distresses. After having been reconciled to God, there is nothing in us
that calls for punishment; for whence comes punishment but on account of guilt?
and when guilt is pardoned, exemption from punishment will quickly
follow.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F308</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And if we be chastised, it is an
evidence that we are not yet sufficiently prepared for
repentance.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In a word, let us remember this
order, which the Prophet points out to us; first, that stripes prepare men for
repentance; secondly, that they are healed, because they are delivered from
eternal destruction; thirdly, that when they have been brought to the knowledge
of their guilt, they obtain pardon; fourthly, that God is gracious and
reconciled to them; fifthly, that chastisements cease after they have obtained
pardon from God. There is no man who ought not to acknowledge in himself what
Isaiah here declares concerning the Egyptians, in whom the Lord holds out an
example to the whole world.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that day.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now foretells that the Lord will
diffuse his goodness throughout the whole world; as if he had said, "It will not
be shut up in a corner, or exclusively known, as it formerly was, by a single
nation." Here he speaks of two nations that were the most inveterate enemies of
the Church, and that appeared to be farther removed than any other from the
kingdom of God; for much more might have been expected from distant nations,
because the nations here mentioned openly made war with God and persecuted his
Church. And if the Lord is so gracious to the deadly enemies of the Church, that
he pardons and adopts them to be his children, what shall be the case with other
nations? This prophecy thus includes the calling of all
nations.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall be a
highway.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Now, when he says that, in consequence
of a <i>highway</i> having been opened up, there will be mutual access that they
may visit each other, he describes brotherly intercourse. We know that the
Egyptians carried on almost incessant wars with the Assyrians, and cherished an
inveterate hatred towards each other. He now foretells that the Lord will change
their dispositions, and will reconcile them to each other, so that they will
have mutual communications, mutual coming in and going out, in consequence of
laying open the <i>highways</i> which were formerly shut. Here we ought to
observe what we formerly remarked at the fourth verse of the second
chapter,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F309</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> namely, that when men have been
reconciled to God, it is likewise proper that they should cherish brotherly
kindness towards each other. Strife, quarreling, disputes, hatred, and malice,
ought to cease when God has been pacified. We need not wonder, therefore, that
he says that a highway to Egypt is opened up for the Assyrians; but this ought
undoubtedly to be referred to the reign of Christ, for we do not read that the
Egyptians were on a friendly footing with the Assyrians till after they had
known Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the
Egyptians shall serve the Assyrians, (or, with the
Assyrians.)</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F310</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This clause may be rendered, "shall serve God;" but as the name of God is not
expressed here, it may refer to the Assyrians, which is also pointed out by the
particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ta</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>eth</i>.)
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F311</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It may therefore be explained thus. They who formerly burned with a desire to
injure one another will be changed in their dispositions, and will desire to
shew kindness. In short, the fruit of true repentance will be made evident, for
they who formerly distressed each other in mutual wars will lend mutual aid. And
this opinion will agree very well with those words of the Prophet with which
they stand connected. Yet I do not set aside another interpretation which is
almost universally adopted, namely, "They who formerly worshipped other gods
will henceforth acknowledge one God, and will assent to the same confession of
faith." I leave every one to adopt that interpretation which he thinks best. If
the latter interpretation be preferred, the Prophet makes brotherly love to flow
from godliness,

as from its source.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that day shall
Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Isaiah concludes the promise which he
had briefly glanced at, that the Egyptians and Assyrians, as well as Israel,
shall be <i>blessed</i>. Formerly the grace of God was in some measure confined
to Israel, because with that nation only had the Lord entered into covenant. The
Lord had stretched out "his cord" over Jacob,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;053209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy

<div><font face="Palatino">In a word, the blessing of God dwelt solely in Judea,
but he says that it will be shared with the Egyptians and Assyrians, under whose
name he includes also the rest of the nations. He does not mention them for the
purpose of shewing respect, but because they were the constant enemies of God,
and appeared to be more estranged from him and farther removed from the hope of
favor than all others. Accordingly, though he had formerly adopted none but the
children of Abraham, he now wished to be called, without distinction, "The
father of all nations."

Because the Lord of hosts will bless

F315</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He assigns a reason, and explains the
former statement; for he shews that, through the undeserved goodness of God, the
Assyrians and Egyptians shall be admitted to fellowship with the chosen people
of God. As if he had said, "Though these titles belonged exclusively to Israel,
they shall likewise be conferred on other nations, which the Lord hath adopted
to be his own." There is a mutual relation between God and his people, so that
they who are called by his mouth "a holy people,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021906&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
19:6,) may justly, in return, call him their God. Yet this designation is
bestowed indiscriminately on Egyptians and
Assyrians.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Blessed be Egypt my
people, and Assyria the work of my hands.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
Though the Prophet intended to describe foreign nations as associated with the
Jews who had belonged to God's household, yet he employs most appropriate marks
to describe the degrees. By calling the Egyptians "the people of God," he means
that they will share in the honor which God deigned to bestow in a peculiar
manner on the Jews alone. When he calls Assyrians
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the work of his
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he distinguishes them by the title
peculiar to his Church. We have elsewhere remarked
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F316</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that the Church is called "the workmanship"
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">to&lt;

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:10,) because by the spirit of regeneration believers are created anew, so as
to bear the image of God. Thus, he means that we are "the work of God's hands,"
not so far as we are created to be men, but so far as they who are separated
from the world, and become new creatures, are created anew to a new life. Hence
we acknowledge that in "newness of life" nothing ought to be claimed as our own,
for we are wholly "the work of
God."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Israel my
inheritance.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When he comes to <i>Israel</i>, he
invests him with his prerogative, which is, that he is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the inheritance of
God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> so that among the new brethren he still
holds the rank and honor of the first-born. The word <i>inheritance</i> suggests
the idea of some kind of superiority; and indeed that covenant which the Lord
first made with them, bestowed on them the privilege which cannot be made void
by their ingratitude; for "the gifts and calling of God are without repentance,"
as Paul declares,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451129&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans

still hold the highest rank, not by their own merit, but by the firmness of the

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In the
preceding chapter Isaiah prophesied about the calamity which threatened Egypt,
and at the same time promised to it the mercy of God. He now introduces the same
subject, and shews that Israel will be put to shame by this chastisement of the
Egyptians, because they placed their confidence in Egypt. He now joins Ethiopia,
which makes it probable that the Ethiopians were leagued with the Egyptians, as
I have formerly remarked, and as we shall see again at the thirty-seventh
chapter.</font><br><font face="Palatino">First, we must observe the time of this
prediction. It was when the Jews were pressed hard by necessity to resort, even
against their will, to foreign nations for assistance. Sacred history informs us
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121817&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 18:17) that <i>Tartan</i> was one of Sennacherib's captains, which
constrains us to acknowledge that this <i>Sargon</i> was Sennacherib, who had
two names, as may be easily learned from this passage. We must also consider
what was the condition of Israel, for the ten tribes had been led into
captivity. Judea appeared almost to be utterly ruined, for nearly the whole
country was conquered, except Jerusalem, which was besieged by Rabshakeh.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121813&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 18:13.) Tartan, on the other hand, was besieging Ashdod. Sacred history
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121817&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 18:17) mentions three captains;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F317</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and this makes it probable that
Sennacherib's forces were at that time divided into three parts, that at the
same instant he might strike terror on all, and might throw them into such
perplexity and confusion that they could not render assistance to each other.
Nothing was now left for the Jews but to call foreign nations to their aid. In
the mean time, Isaiah is sent by God to declare that their expectation is vain
in relying on the Egyptians, against whom the arm of the Lord was now lifted up,
and who were so far from assisting them, that they were unable to defend
themselves against their enemies. Hence the Jews ought to acknowledge that they
are justly punished for their unbelief, because they had forsaken God and fled
to the Egyptians.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We must consider the end which
is here proposed, for the design of God was not to forewarn the Egyptians, but
to correct the unbelief of the people, which incessantly carried them away to
false and wicked hopes. In order therefore to teach them that they ought to rely
on God alone, the Prophet here foretells what awaits their useless helpers. The
warning was highly seasonable, for the Ethiopians had begun to repel the
Assyrians, and had forced them to retire, and no event could have occurred which
would have been more gladly hailed by the Jews. Lest those successful beginnings
should make them wanton, he foretells that this aid will be of short duration,
because both the Ethiopians and the Egyptians will soon be most disgracefully
vanquished.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go and loose the sackcloth from
thy loins.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In order to confirm this prophecy by
the use of a symbol, the Lord commanded Isaiah to walk naked. If Isaiah had done
this of his own accord, he would have been justly ridiculed; but when he does it
by the command of the Lord, we perceive nothing but what is fitted to excite
admiration and to strike awe. In this nakedness, and in the signs of a similar
kind, something weighty is implied. Besides, the Lord does nothing either by
himself or by his servants without likewise explaining the reason; and therefore
the Prophet does not merely walk naked, but points out the design which the Lord
had in view in ordering him to do so. In other respects false prophets imitate
the true servants of God, and put on varied and imposing shapes, to dazzle the
eyes of the multitude, and gain credit to themselves; but those symbols are
worthless, because God is not the author of
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This ought to be carefully observed in
opposition to the Papists, who bring forward empty ceremonies instead of true
sacraments. This is the rule with which we ought to meet them. If they proceed
from God, we ought to embrace them, but if not, we may boldly reject them; and,
indeed, they cannot be adopted without offering an insult to God, because in
such cases men usurp his authority. Besides, God does not bring forward signs
without the word, for what would a sacrament be if we beheld nothing but the
sign? It is the doctrine alone that makes the sacrament, and therefore let us
know that it is mere hypocrisy where no doctrine is taught, and that Papists act
wickedly when they lay aside doctrine, and give the name of sacrament to empty
ceremonies; for the Lord has connected them in such a manner that no man can
separate them without infringing that order which he has
enjoined.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When the Lord commands him to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>loose the
sackcloth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> almost all the commentators
infer from it that Isaiah at that time wore a garment of mourning, because he
bewailed the distressed condition of Israel; for sackcloth was a mourning dress,
as is evident from Joel
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;290113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joel
1:13.) Their interpretation is, that this was done in order that, in the dress
of culprits, he might supplicate pardon from God, or that it was impossible for
his countenance or his dress to be cheerful when his heart was sad, and he could
not but be affected with the deepest grief when he beheld so great a calamity.
Some think that it was his ordinary dress, because the Prophets, as Zechariah
informs us, commonly wore a mantle.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;381304&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
13:4.) But that conjecture rests on exceedingly slight grounds, and has no great
probability. It is more probable that he wore sackcloth as expressive of
mourning. Judea was at that time sunk into such a state of indifference, that
when men saw their brethren wretchedly distressed and wasted, still they were
not affected by it, and did not think that the affliction of their brethren was
a matter which at all concerned them. They still thought that they were beyond
the reach of danger, and mocked at the Prophets when they threatened and
foretold destruction. Hence Micah also complains that no man bewails the
distresses of Israel.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;330101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Micah
1:11.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">A question arises, Was this actually
done, or was it merely and simply a vision which he told to the people? The
general opinion is, that the Prophet never went naked, but that this was
exhibited to him in a vision, and only once. They allege as a reason, that on
account of heat and cold, and other inconveniences of the weather, he could not
have walked naked during the whole period of three years. What if we should say
that the Prophet wore clothes at home, and also in public, unless when he wished
to come forth to teach, and that on such occasions he was accustomed to present
to the people a spectacle of nakedness? I pay little attention to the argument,
that he was unable to endure heat and cold; for God, who commanded him to do
this, could easily strengthen and protect him. But they assign another reason,
that nakedness would have been unbecoming in a Prophet. I answer, this nakedness
was not more unbecoming than circumcision, which irreligious men might consider
to be the most absurd of all sights, because it made an exposure of the uncomely
parts. Yet it must not be thought that the Prophet went entirely naked, or
without covering those parts which would present a revolting aspect. It was
enough that the people understood what the Lord was doing, and were affected by
it as something extraordinary.</font><br><font face="Palatino">I am led to form
this opinion by what is here said, "<i>By the hand</i> of Isaiah; " for although
this mode of expression frequently occurs elsewhere, still we never find it
where it does not imply something emphatic, to describe the effect produced. He
places himself in the midst between God and his countrymen, so as to be the
herald of a future calamity, not only in words, but likewise by a visible
symbol. Nor is it superfluous that it is immediately added, <i>He did so</i>. I
am therefore of opinion that Isaiah walked naked whenever he discharged the
office of a prophet, and that he uncovered those parts which could be beheld
without shame.</font><br><font face="Palatino">So far as relates to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sackcloth</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
although it was customary for men in private stations of life to express their
guilt in this manner in adversity, yet it is probable that it was with a view to
his office that Isaiah made use of this symbol to confirm his doctrine, that he
might the better arouse the people from their sluggishness. If at any time the
Lord chastise ourselves or our brethren, he does not enjoin us to change our
raiment, but we are cruel and
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">a]storgoi</font><font face="Palatino">)
without natural affection, if we are not moved by the afflictions of brethren
and the ruin of the Church. If we have any feeling towards God, we ought to be
in sadness and tears; and if it be our duty to mourn, we ought also to exhort
others and stimulate them by our example to feel the calamities of the Church,
and to be touched with some
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sumpaqei&gt;a|</font><font face="Palatino">)
compassion.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Three
years.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Why for such a period? Because that was
the time granted to the Egyptians and Ethiopians, during which the Lord gave
them a truce for repentance, and at the same time wished to make trial of the
obedience of his people, that without delay they might relinquish unlawful aid,
and that, though the Egyptians and Ethiopians appeared to be secure, they might
know that they were not far from ruin. The Lord intended also to expose the
rebellion of wicked men; for undoubtedly many persons made an open display of
their impiety when they despised the nakedness of the prophet, and the godly, on
the other hand, moved by the sight of his nakedness, though the prosperity of
the Ethiopians was delightfully attractive, still did not hesitate to fix their
attention on the word. What they were bound to consider was not the nakedness
itself, but the mark which the Lord had put upon it; in the same manner as, in
the visible sacraments, we ought to behold those things which are
invisible.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The captivity of Egypt and the
removal of Ethiopia.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F318</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The words "captivity" and "removal" are
taken collectively, to denote the multitude of captives and emigrants. Next, he
shews that there will be no distinction of age, declaring that the <i>old</i>,
as well as the <i>young</i>, shall be led into
captivity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall be
afraid.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now shews for whose benefit he had
foretold these things about the Egyptians and Ethiopians. It was in order that
the Jews might learn amidst their afflictions to hope in God, and might not have
recourse to foreign aid, which the Lord had
forbidden.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lo, what is become of our
expectation?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He calls them <i>expectation</i>,
or <i>lurking</i>, because the Jews turned towards them, whenever they were
oppressed by any calamity, and placed their hope in them. We are accustomed to
turn our eyes to that quarter from which we expect any assistance. Hence also,
to "look" often signifies, in the Hebrew language, to "hope." (Psams 34:5;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;180619&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
6:19.) Now, they ought to have looked to God alone. Their wandering levity is
therefore censured. And the same thing must happen to us, and deservedly, that
which we have been invited by God, and refuse the sure refuge which he offers to
us, and allow ourselves to be captivated by the delusions of Satan, we may lie
down naked and destitute with shame and
disgrace.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the inhabitants
of the island shall say.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He gives the name
<i>island</i> not only to Jerusalem, but to the whole of Judea; and it is
generally thought that the name is given because its shores are washed by the
Mediterranean sea. But I think that there is a different reason for this
metaphor, for it is but a small portion of the sea that washes it; but as an
<i>island</i> is separated from other lands, so the Lord separated Judea from
other countries. It was kept apart from all the nations, which cherished a
mortal hatred towards the Jews; for there was a "wall" between them, as Paul
says,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:14,) which Christ at length threw down. Here again Isaiah confirms his
prophecy. If you are not now moved by my nakedness, you shall one day be taught
by the event, that these words were not spoken to you in vain. Thus, at a late
hour, obstinate and rebellious men are constrained by God to confess their
guilt, so that they are struck with amazement, and argue within themselves how
they could be so greatly blinded by their own stubbornness.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The burden of the desert of the
sea.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet, after having taught that
their hope ought to be placed, not on the Egyptians, but on the mercy of God
alone, and after having foretold that calamities would come on the nations on
whose favor they relied, adds a consolation in order to encourage the hearts of
the godly. He declares, that for the Chaldeans, to whom they will be captives, a
reward is prepared; from which it follows, that God takes account of the
injuries which they endure. By <i>the
desert</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F319</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he means Chaldea, not that it was
deserted or thinly inhabited, but because the Jews had a desert on that side of
them; just as if, instead of Italy, we should name "the Alps," because they are
nearer to us, and because we must cross them on our road to Italy. This reason
ought to be kept in view; for he does not describe the nature of the country,
but forewarns the Jews that the destruction of the enemies, which he foretells,
is near at hand, and is as certain as if the event had been before their eyes,
as that desert was. Besides, the prophets sometimes spoke ambiguously about
Babylon, that believers alone might understand the hidden mysteries, as Jeremiah
changes the king's name.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F320</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As
storms from the south.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the
south</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because that wind is tempestuous, and
produces storms and whirlwinds.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F321</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
When he adds that "it cometh from the desert," this tends to heighten the
picture; for if any storm arise in a habitable and populous region, it excites
less terror than those which spring up in deserts. In order to express the
shocking nature of this calamity, he compares it to storms, which begin in the
desert, and afterwards take a more impetuous course, and rush with greater
violence.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet the Prophet appears to mean
something else, namely, that as they burst forth like storms from that direction
to lay Judea desolate, so another storm would soon afterwards arise to destroy
them; and therefore he says that this burden will come
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from a terrible
land</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By this designation I understand Judea to
be meant, for it was not enough to speak of the ruin of Babylon, if the Jews did
not likewise understand that it came from God. Why he calls it "a terrible land"
we have seen in our exposition of the eighteenth chapter.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F322</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It was because, in consequence of so many displays of the wrath of God, its
disfigured appearance might strike terror on all. The occasion on which the
words are spoken does not allow us to suppose that it is called "terrible" on
account of the astonishing power of God by which it was protected. Although
therefore Babylon was taken and plundered by the Persians and Medes, Isaiah
declares that its destruction will come from Judea; because in this manner God
will revenge the injuries done to that nation of which he had promised to be the
guardian.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A harsh
vision.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As the object was to soothe the grief
of the people, it may be thought not to be appropriate to call a vision, which
is the occasion of joy, <i>a harsh vision</i>. But this refers to the
Babylonians, who, puffed up with their prosperity, dreaded no danger; for wealth
commonly produces pride and indifference. As if he had said, "It is useless to
hold out the riches and power of the Babylonians, and when a stone is hard,
there will be found a hard hammer to break
it."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
spoiler.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As Babylon had gained its power by
plundering and laying waste other nations, it seemed to be free from all danger.
Although they had been a terror to others, and had practiced every kind of
barbarity and cruelty, yet they could not avoid becoming a prey and enduring
injuries similar to those which they had inflicted on others. The Prophet goes
farther, and, in order to obtain credit to his statements, pronounces it to be a
righteous retaliation, that violence should correspond to
violence.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go up, O
Elam.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> <i>Elam</i> is a part of Persia; but is
taken for the whole of Persia, and on this account also the Persians are called
Elamites. It is worthy of observation, that, when Isaiah foretold these things,
there was no probability of war, and that he was dead a hundred years before
there was any apprehension of this calamity. Hence it is sufficiently evident
that he could not have derived his information on this subject from any other
than the Spirit of God; and this contributes greatly to confirm the truth and
certainty of the
prediction.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Besiege, O
Mede.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By commanding the Medes and Persians, he
declares that this will not befall the Babylonians at random or by chance, but
by the sure decree of God, in whose name, and not in that of any private
individual, he makes the announcement. Coming forward therefore in the name of
God, he may, like a captain or general, command his soldiers to assemble to give
battle. In what manner God employs the agency of robbers and wicked men, has
been formerly explained at the tenth
chapter.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F323</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have made all his
groaning to cease.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some understand it to mean,
that the groaning, to which the Babylonians had given occasion, ceased after
they were subdued by the Medes and Persians; for by their tyrannical measures
they had caused many to groan, which must happen when wicked and ungodly men
possess rank and power. Others approach more closely, perhaps, to the real
meaning of the Prophet, when they say, that "the groaning ceased," because the
Babylonians experienced no compassion, having formerly shewn none to others. But
I explain it more simply to mean, that the Lord was deaf to their groanings; as
if he had said, that there would be no room for their groanings and
lamentations, because having been cruel and barbarous, it was just that they
should receive back the same measure which they had meted out to others.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
7:2.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore are my loins, filled
with pain.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here the Prophet represents the
people as actually present, for it was not enough to have simply foretold the
destruction of Babylon, if he had not confirmed the belief of the godly in such
a manner that they felt as if the actual event were placed before their eyes.
Such a representation was necessary, and the Prophet does not here describe the
feelings of his own heart, as if he had compassion on the Babylonians, but, on
the contrary, as we have formerly
said,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F324</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he assumes, for the time, the character
of a Babylonian.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F325</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It ought undoubtedly to satisfy our minds that the hidden judgments of God are
held out to us, as in a mirror, that they may arouse the sluggishness of our
faith; and therefore the Prophets describe with greater beauty and copiousness,
and paint in lively colors, those things which exceed the capacity of our
reason. The Prophet, thus expressing his grief, informs believers how awful is
the vengeance of God which awaits the Chaldeans, and how dreadfully they will be
punished, as we are struck with surprise and horror when any sad intelligence is
brought to us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As the pangs of
a woman that travaileth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He adds a stronger
expression of grief, when he compares it to that of a woman in labor, as when a
person under fearful anguish turns every way, and writhes in every part of his
body. Such modes of expression are employed by the Prophets on account of our
sluggishness, for we do not perceive the judgments of God till they be pointed
at, as it were, with the finger, and affect our senses. We are warned to be on
our guard before they arrive.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My heart was
shaken.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Others render it not amiss, "my heart
wandered;" for excessive terror moves the heart, as it were, out of its place.
He declares how sudden and unlooked for will be the destruction of Babylon, for
a sudden calamity makes us tremble more than one which has been long foreseen
and expected. Daniel relates, that what Isaiah here foretells was accomplished,
and that he was an eye-witness. Belshazzar had that night prepared a magnificent
banquet, when the Persians suddenly rushed upon him, and nothing was farther
from his expectation than that he would be slain. High delight was thus suddenly
changed into terror.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;270530&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
5:30.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Prepare the
table.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> These verbs may be taken for
participles; as if he had said, "While they were preparing the table and
appointing a guard, while they were eating and drinking, sudden terror arose;
there was a call to arms, Arise ye princes," etc.. But Isaiah presents lively
descriptions, so as to place the actual event, as it were, before our eyes.
Certainly Xenophon does not describe so historically the storming of the city;
and this makes it evident that it was not natural sagacity, but heavenly
inspiration, that taught Isaiah to describe so vividly events that were unknown.
Besides, we ought to observe the time when these predictions were uttered; for
at that time the kingdom of Babylon was in its most flourishing condition, and
appeared to have invincible power, and dreaded no danger. Isaiah ridicules this
vain confidence, and shews that this power will speedily be laid in
ruins.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Let it not be thought absurd that he
introduces the watchmen as speaking; for although the siege had not shaken off
the slothfulness of a proud and foolish tyrant so as to hinder him from
indulging in gaiety and feasting, still there is no room to doubt that men were
appointed to keep watch. It is customary indeed with princes to defend
themselves by guards, that they may more freely and without any disturbance
abandon themselves to every kind of pleasure; but the Prophet expressly mixes up
the sentinels with the delicacies of the table, to make it more evident that the
wicked tyrant was seized with a spirit of giddiness before he sunk down to
drunken reveling. The king of Babylon was thus feasting and indulging in mirth
with his courtiers, when he was overtaken by a sudden and unexpected calamity,
not that he was out of danger, but because he disregarded and scorned the enemy.
The day before it happened, it might have been thought incredible, for the
conspiracy of Gobryas, and of that party which betrayed him, had not yet been
discovered. At the time when Isaiah spoke, none would have thought that an event
so extraordinary would ever take
place.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thus hath the Lord said to
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet is commanded to set a
<i>watchman</i> on the watchtower, to see these things at a distance; for they
cannot be perceived by the eyes, or learned by conjecture. In order, therefore,
that all may know that he did not speak at random, he declares that he foretells
these things; for although they are unknown to men, and incredible, yet he
clearly and distinctly knows them by the spirit of prophecy, because he is
elevated above the judgment of men. This ought to be carefully observed; for we
must not imagine that the prophets learned from men, or foresaw by their own
sagacity, those things which they made known; and on this account also they were
justly called "Seers."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;090909&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 9:9.) Though we also see them, yet our sight is dull, and we scarcely
perceive what is at our feet; and even the most acute men are often in darkness,
because they understand nothing but what they can gather by the use of reason.
But the prophets speak by the Spirit of God, as from heaven. The amount of what
is stated is, that whosoever shall attempt to measure this prophecy by their own
judgment will do wrong, because it has proceeded from God, and therefore it goes
far beyond our sense.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go,
appoint a watchman.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It gives additional weight
that he "appoints a watchman in the name of God." If it be objected, "You relate
incredible things as if they had actually happened," he replies that he does not
declare them at random; for he whom the prince has appointed to be a watchman,
sees from a distance what others do not know. Thus Isaiah saw by the revelation
of the Spirit what was unknown to
others.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he saw a
chariot.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What he now adds contains a lively
description of that defeat. Some think that it is told by the king's messenger.
This is a mistake; for the Prophet, on the contrary, foretells what he has
learned from the watchman whom he appointed by the command of God. Here he
represents the watchman as looking and reporting what he saw. As if at the first
glance he had not seen it clearly he says that there is "a chariot," and
afterwards observing more closely, he says that there is "a couple of horses" in
the chariot. At first, on account of the novelty and great distance of the
objects, the report given is ambiguous and confused; but afterwards, when a
nearer view is obtained, they are better understood. There is no absurdity in
applying to prophets or to divine visions what belongs to men; for we know that
God, accommodating himself to our feeble capacity, takes upon himself human
feelings.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he cried, A lion.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">"Having hearkened diligently with much heed,"
at length he observes a <i>lion</i>. This is supposed to mean Darius who
conquered and pillaged Babylon, as we learn from Daniel.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;270528&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
5:28, 31.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I stand
continually.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When the watchman says that he is
continually on his watchtower by day and by night, this tends to confirm the
prediction, as if he had said that nothing can be more certain than this vision;
for they whom God has appointed to keep watch are neither drowsy nor
dim-sighted. Meanwhile, by this example, he exhorts and stimulates believers to
the same kind of attention, that by the help of the lamp of the word, they may
obtain a distant view of the power of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Babylon is fallen, is fallen.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This shews
plainly that it is not king Belshazzar's watchman who is introduced, for this
speech would be unsuitable to such a character. The Prophet therefore makes
known, by the command of God, what would happen. Now, this may refer either to
God or to Darius, as well as to the watchman; and it makes little difference as
to the meaning, for Darius, being God's servant in this matter, is not
inappropriately represented to be the herald of that judgment. There would be
greater probability in referring it to God himself; for Darius had no such
thoughts when he overthrew the idols of the Babylonians. But the speech agrees
better with the character of a guardian, as if an angel added an interpretation
to the prophecy.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And all the
graven images of her gods.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There is here an
implied contrast between the living God and dead idols. This mode of expression,
too, deserves notice, when he calls them "images of gods;" for the Babylonians
knew, as all idolaters loudly proclaim, that their images are not gods. Yet they
ascribed to them divine power, and when this is done, "the truth of God is
changed into a lie,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450125&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:25,) and not only so, but God himself is denied. But on this subject we shall
afterwards speak more largely. Here we see, that by her destruction Babylon was
punished for idolatry, for he assigns the reason why Babylon was destroyed. It
was because the Lord could not endure that she should glory in her "graven
images."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My thrashing, and the son of my
floor.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F326</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The wealth of that powerful monarchy
having dazzled the eyes of all men by its splendor, what Isaiah foretold about
its destruction might be reckoned fabulous. He therefore leads their minds to
God, in order to inform them that it was God who had undertaken to destroy
Babylon, and that it is not by the will of men, but by divine power, that such
loftiness will fall to the ground. The "thrashing" and "the son of the floor"
mean the same thing; for this mode of expression is frequently employed by
Hebrew writers, who often repeat the same statement in different
language.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This passage ought to be carefully
observed, that we may correct a vice which is natural to us, that of measuring
the power of God by our own standard. Not only does our feebleness place us far
below the wisdom of God; but we are wicked and depraved judges of his works, and
cannot be induced to take any other view of them than of what comes within the
reach of the ability and wisdom of men. But we ought always to remember his
almighty power, and especially when our own reason and judgment fail us. Thus,
when the Church is oppressed by tyrants to such a degree that there appears to
be no hope of deliverance, let us know that the Lord will lay them low, and, by
trampling on their pride and abasing their strength, will shew that they are his
"thrashing-floor; " for the subject of this prediction was not a person of mean
rank, but the most powerful and flourishing of all monarchies. The more they
have exalted themselves, the more quickly will they be destroyed, and the Lord
will execute his "thrashing" upon them. Let us learn that what the Lord has here
given as a manifestation of inconceivable ruin, applies to persons of the same
stamp.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That which I have heard
from the Lord of hosts.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When he says that he
has "heard it from the Lord of hosts," he sets a seal, as it were, on his
prophecy; for he declares that he has not brought forward his own conjectures,
but has received it from the Lord himself. Here it is worthy of our notice, that
the servants of God ought to be fortified by this boldness to speak in the name
of God, as Peter also exhorts, "He that speaketh, let him speak as the oracles
of God."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 4:11.) Impostors also boast of the name of God, but his faithful servants
have the testimony of their conscience that they bring forward nothing but what
God has enjoined. Observe, also, that this confirmation was highly necessary,
for the whole world trembled at the resources of this powerful
monarchy.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From the Lord of
hosts, the God of Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is not without
reason that he gives to God these two appellations. As to the former, it is
indeed a title which always applies to God; but here, undoubtedly, the Prophet
had his eye on the matter in hand, in order to contrast the power of God with
all the troops of the Babylonians, for God has not a single army, but
innumerable armies, to subdue his enemies. Again, he calls him "the God of
Israel," because by destroying Babylon he shewed himself to be the defender and
guardian of his people; for the overthrow of that monarchy procured freedom for
the Jews. In short, all these things were done for the sake of the Church, which
the Prophet has here in view; for it is not the Babylonians, who undoubtedly
laughed at these predictions, but believers, whom he exhorts to rest assured
that, though they were oppressed by the Babylonians, and scattered and tossed
about, still God would take care of
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The burden of Dumah.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">It is evident from
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012514&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
25:14, that this nation was descended from a son of Ishmael, to whom this name
was given, and hence his posterity are called Dumeans.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F327</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The cause of their destruction, which is here foretold, cannot be known with
certainty, and this prophecy is obscure on account of its brevity. Yet we ought
always to remember what I have formerly remarked, that it was proper that the
Jews should be fortified against the dreadful stumbling-blocks which were
approaching. When so many changes take place, particularly if the world is
turned upside down, and if there is a rapid succession of events, we are
perplexed and entertain doubts whether all things happen at random and by
chance, or are regulated by the providence of God. The Lord therefore shews that
it is he who effects this revolution, and renews the state of the world, that we
may learn that nothing here is of long duration, and may have our whole heart
and our whole aim directed to the reign of Christ, which alone is
everlasting.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Since therefore these changes were
near at hand, it was proper that the Jews should be forewarned, that when the
event followed, they should call them to remembrance, contemplate the wisdom of
God, and strengthen their faith. Besides, there is no room to doubt that the
Jews were harassed by various thoughts, when they saw the whole world shaken on
all sides, and desired to have some means of avoiding those storms and tempests;
for we always wish to be in safety and beyond the reach of danger. Some might
have wished to find new abodes, that they might better provide for their own
safety; but when storms raged on every hand, they were reminded to remain at
home, and to believe that no safer habitation could anywhere be found than in
the company of the godly.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This example ought
also to be a warning to many who separate themselves from the Church through
fear of danger, and do not consider that a greater danger awaits them out of it.
These thoughts might therefore distress the Jews, for we have seen in the eighth
chapter that their minds were
restless.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F328</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> When they were thus tossed about in
uncertainty, and fleeing to foreign nations, they would naturally lose heart;
and this, I think, is the chief reason why the destruction of the Dumeans is
foretold, namely, that the Jews might seek God with their whole heart, and that
above all things they might commit to his care the safety of the Church. Let us
therefore learn to keep ourselves within the Church, though she be afflicted by
various calamities, and let us bear patiently the fatherly chastisements which
are inflicted on children, instead of choosing to go astray, that we may drink
the dregs which choke the wicked.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197508&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
75:8;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah

molestation from the people of God, when their neighbors assailed them on every
side.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Out of
Seir.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Mount Seir, as we learn from the book of
Genesis, was a mountain of the Edomites.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
14:6; 32:3; 36:8, 9.) Under the name of this mountain he includes the whole
kingdom. In this place he represents, as in a picture, those things which called
for an earnest
address.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Watchman, what of the
night?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is probable that the Edomites, who
put the question, were not at a great distance from them, and that they were
solicitous about the danger as one in which they were themselves involved. He
introduces them as inquiring at the "watchman," not through curiosity, but with
a view to their own advantage, what he had observed in "the night," just as when
one has asked a question, a second and a third person follow him, asking the
same thing. This is the meaning of the repetition, that the inquiry is made not
by one individual only, but by many persons, as commonly happens in cases of
doubt and perplexity, when every man is afraid on his own account, and does not
believe what is said by others.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The morning
cometh.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This means that the anxiety will not
last merely for a single day, or for a short time, as if the watchman had
replied, "What I tell you to-day, I will tell you again to-morrow; if you are
afraid now, you will also be afraid to-morrow." It is a most wretched condition
when men are tortured with anxiety, in such a manner that they hang in a state
of doubt between death and life; and it is that dismal curse which the Lord
threatens against wicked men by Moses,</font><br></div>

28:67.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The godly indeed are beset with many dangers, but
they know that they and their life are committed to the hand of God, and even in
the jaws of death they see life, or at least soothe their uneasy fears by hope
and patience. But the wicked always tremble, and not only are tormented by
alarm, but waste away in their
sorrows.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Return,

either that if they run continually, they will lose their pains, or in this way,
"If any among you be more careful, let them go to Dumah, and there let them
tremble more than in their native country, for nowhere will they be safe." But
since God always takes care of his Church, nowhere shall we find a safer
retreat, even though we shall compass sea and
land.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.

Arabia.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now passes on to the Arabians, and
foretells that they too, in their own turn, will be dragged to the judgment-seat
of God; so that he does not leave unnoticed any of the nations which were known
to the Jews. He declares that they will be seized with such fear that they will
leave their houses and flee into the woods; and he states the direction in which
they will flee, that is, to
"Dedanim."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To meet the thirsty bring
waters.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F329</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He heightens the description of that
trembling with which the Lord had determined to strike the Arabians in such a
manner that they thought of nothing but flight, and did not take time even to
collect those things which were necessary for the journey. Isaiah therefore
declares that the Arabians will come into the country of Dedanim, empty and
destitute of all things, and that they will not be provided with any food. On
this account he exhorts the inhabitants to go out and meet them with bread and
water, because otherwise they will faint through the want of the necessaries of
life.</font><br><font face="Palatino">I am aware that this passage is explained
differently by some commentators, who think that the Prophet mocks at the
Arabians, who had been cruel and barbarous towards the Jews; as if he had said,
"How gladly you would now bring water to the thirsty!" But that exposition is
too constrained. And yet I do not deny that they received the reward of their
cruelty, when they ran hither and thither in a state of hunger. But the meaning
which I have given is twofold,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F330</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that the Arabians in their flight will be so wretched that they will not even
have the necessary supply of water, and they will therefore faint with thirst,
if they do not quickly receive assistance; and he intimates that there will be a
scarcity both of food and of drink. He calls on the neighbors to render
assistance; not to exhort them to do their duty, but to state the fact more
clearly; and he enjoins them to give their bread to them, not because it is
deserved, but because they are suffering extreme want. Yet as it is founded on
the common law of nature and humanity, the Prophet indirectly insinuates that
the hungry and thirsty are defrauded of their bread, when food is denied to
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For they flee from the face of
the swords.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F331</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He means that the calamity will be
dreadful, and that the Arabians will have good reason for betaking themselves to
flight, because the enemies will pursue them with arms and with swords, so that
they will have no other way of providing for their safety than by flight. The
reason why he foretells this defeat is plain enough; for it was necessary that
the Jews should obtain early information of that which should happen long after,
that they might learn that the world is governed by the providence of God and
not by chance, and likewise that they should be taught by the example of others
to behold God as the judge of all nations, wherever they turned their eyes. We
do not know, and history does not inform us, whether or not the Arabians were
enemies of the Jews. However that may be, it is certain that these things are
spoken for the consolation of the godly, that they may behold the justice of God
towards all nations, and may acknowledge that his judgment-seat is at Jerusalem,
from which he will pronounce judgment on the whole
world.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thus hath the Lord said
to me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He adds that this defeat of the
Arabians, of which he prophesied, is close at hand; which tended greatly to
comfort the godly. We are naturally fiery, and do not willingly allow the object
of our desire to be delayed; and the Lord takes into account our weakness in
this respect, when he says that he hastens his work. He therefore declares that
he prophesies of things which shall happen, not after many ages, but
immediately, that the Jews may bear more patiently their afflictions, from which
they know that they will be delivered in a short
time.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yet a year according to
the years of the hireling.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Of the metaphor of
"the year of the hireling," which he adds for the purpose of stating the matter
more fully, we have already spoken.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F332</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It means that the time will not be
delayed. The same comparison is used by heathen authors, where they intend to
describe a day appointed and desired; as appears from that passage in Horace,
"The day appears long to those who must render an account of their work."
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F333</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the residue of the
archers.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He threatens that this slaughter will
not be the end of their evils, because if there be any residue in Arabia, they
will gradually decrease; as if he had said, "The Lord will not merely impoverish
the Arabians by a single battle, but will pursue to the very utmost, till all
hope of relief is taken away, and they are utterly exterminated." Such is the
vengeance which he executes against the ungodly, while he moderates the
punishment which he inflicts on the godly, that they may not be entirely
destroyed.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Of the mighty
men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He means warlike men and those who were
fit to carry arms, and says, that although they escaped that slaughter, still
they will be cut off at their own time. He formerly threatened similar
chastisements against the Jews, but always accompanied by a promise which was
fitted to alleviate their grief or at least to guard them against despair. It
frequently happens that the children of God are afflicted as severely as the
reprobate, or even with greater severity; but the hope of favor which is held
out distinguishes them from the whole world. Again, when we learn that God
visits on the wicked deadly vengeance, this is no reason why we should be
immoderately grieved even at the heaviest punishments; but, on the contrary, we
ought to draw from it this consolation, that he chastises them gently, and "does
not give them over to death."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B818&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
118:18.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The God of Israel
hath spoken it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet shews, as we have
frequently remarked on former occasions, that we ought not only to acknowledge
that these things happened by divine appointment, but that they were appointed
by that God whom Israel adores. All men are sometimes constrained to rise to the
acknowledgment of God, though they are disposed to believe in chance, because
the thought that there is a God in heaven comes into their minds, whether they
will or not, and that both in prosperity and in adversity; but then they imagine
a Deity according to their own fancy, either in heaven or on earth. Since
therefore irreligious men idly and foolishly imagine a God according to their
own pleasure, the Prophet directs the Jews to that God whom they adore, that
they may know the distinguished privilege which they enjoy in being placed under
his guardianship and protection. Nor is it enough that we adore some God as
governor of the world, but we must acknowledge the true God, who revealed
himself to the fathers, and hath manifested himself to us in Christ. And this
ought to be earnestly maintained, in opposition to the profane thoughts of many
persons who contrive some strange and confused notion of a Deity, because they
dare not openly deny God.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The burden of the valley of
vision.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Isaiah again prophesies against Judea,
which he calls <i>the valley of vision</i>. He gives this appellation to the
whole of Judea rather than to Jerusalem, of which he afterwards speaks; but now
in the preface he includes the whole of Judea. He appropriately calls it a
"valley," for it was surrounded on all sides by mountains. It is a harsher view
of the metaphor, which is adopted by some, that Jerusalem is called "a valley,"
because it was thrown down from its loftiness. The reason why he adds the words,
<i>of</i> <i>vision</i>, is plain enough. The Lord enlightened the whole of
Judea by his word; the prophets were continually employed in it, and that was
the reason why they called them <i>seers</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;090909&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 9:9.) There is also an implied contrast here, for valleys have less light
than open plains, because the height of the mountains intercepts the light of
the sun. Now, this valley, he tells us, is more highly enlightened than those
countries which were exposed on all sides to the sun. It was by the
extraordinary goodness of God that this happened; for he means, that it was
enlightened, not by the rays of the sun, but by the word of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Besides, the Prophet unquestionably
intended to beat down that foolish confidence with which the Jews were puffed
up, because God had distinguished them above others by remarkable gifts. They
abused his word and prophecies, as if by means of them they had been protected
against all danger, though they were disobedient and rebellious against God. He
therefore declares that visions will not prevent God from punishing their
ingratitude; and he even aggravates their guilt by this mark of ingratitude,
that amidst such splendor of heavenly doctrine they still continued to stumble
like the blind.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What hast thou
here?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> or, What hast thou now?</i> He now
addresses Jerusalem; not that this defeat affects Jerusalem alone, but because
the whole country thought it safe to take refuge under the shadow of the
sanctuary which then existed, and to lead the Jews to reflect, since this befell
a fortified city, what would become of other cities which had no means of
defense. He asks in astonishment, "What does it mean that every person leaves
his house and flies to the house-top for the purpose of saving his life?" Among
the Jews the form of house-tops was different from what is now customary with
us, and hence arose that saying of Christ,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"What you have heard in
the ear proclaim on the housetops."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401027&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
10:27.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When the inhabitants of Jerusalem fled to the
house-tops, they left their houses open to be a prey to enemies, and this was a
proof that they were exceedingly afraid. It is likewise possible that they went
up to the house-tops for the purpose of throwing down javelins and other weapons
against the enemies, whose arrival not only terrified them, but made them flee
in consternation, and yet they did not escape
danger.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou that art full of noises.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He means that it was exceedingly populous; for
where great multitudes of people are brought together, noise abounds; and
therefore, amidst so crowded a population, there was less cause of fear. In
order to make the representation still more striking, Isaiah has therefore added
this circumstance, that instead of being, as they ought to have been, walls and
bulwarks to defend the city, when there was no scarcity of men, they
ignominiously turned their backs on the enemies, and fled to the tops of their
houses. By these words he urges the Jews more strongly to consider the judgment
of God; for when such overwhelming fear has seized the hearts of men, it is
certain that God has struck them with trembling; as if he had said, "How comes
it that you have not greater firmness to resist? It is because God pursues and
chases you."</font><br><font face="Palatino">These statements are taken from the
writings of Moses, from which, as we have frequently remarked, the prophets
borrow their instructions, but with this difference, that what Moses spoke in
general terms they apply to the matter in
hand.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The Lord shall cause thee to
be smitten before thine enemies; thou shalt go out one way against them, and
shalt flee seven ways before them. The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and
blindness, and astonishment of
heart."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;052825&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
28:25, 28.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">He reproaches the Jews for their
distressed condition, and with good reason; for it was proper to press the
accusation more closely home, that they might learn to ascribe to their sins and
transgressions all the afflictions and sufferings that they endured. The Lord
had promised that they would continually assist them; and when they are now left
destitute, let them acknowledge that they do not deserve such assistance, and
that God has cast them off on account of their rebelliousness. The Lord does not
deceive or make false promises, but by their own fault those wretched persons
have shut themselves out from his aid and favor; and this is still more strongly
expressed by the question, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What
hast thou here?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It means that God gave
practical evidence that Jerusalem had been deprived of her protector and
guardian; for this mode of expression denotes something strange and
extraordinary.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy slain men
are not slain by the sword.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To exhibit still
more clearly the vengeance of God, he affirms that they who were slain there did
not die bravely in battle. Thus he shews that all that they wanted was manly
courage; for a timid and cowardly heart was a sure proof that they had all been
forsaken by the Lord, by whose assistance they would have bravely and manfully
resisted. He therefore does not mean that the defeat would be accompanied by
shame and disgrace, but ascribes it to the wrath of God that they had not
courage to resist; and unquestionably by this circumstance he beats down their
foolish pride.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All thy rulers are fled
together.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This verse has been interpreted in
various ways. The fact is abundantly plain, but there is some difficulty about
the words. As

to mean, "They fled before others, though they were situated in the most distant
parts of the country, and were in greater danger." Others render it, "Although
they were at a great distance from Jerusalem, still they did not cease to flee
like men who are seized with terror, and never stop in their flight, because
they continually think that the enemy is at their
heels."</font><br><font face="Palatino">But a more natural interpretation
appears to me to be. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have
fled from afar</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, "they who have
resorted to Jerusalem as a safe retreat will be seized by enemies and
vanquished; " for Jerusalem might be regarded as the general protection of the
whole of Judea, and therefore, when a war broke out, the inhabitants rushed to
it from every quarter. While they looked upon their habitation in Jerusalem as
safe, they were taken prisoners. Others suppose it to refer to the siege of
Sennacherib.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121813&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 18:13;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;143201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 32:1.) But I cannot be persuaded to expound the passage in this
manner, for he speaks of the destruction of Jerusalem. When it was besieged by
Sennacherib, the Lord immediately delivered it; none were taken or made
prisoners, and there was no slaughter of men. These events therefore happened
long after the death of the Prophet, and sacred history relates them, and
informs us that in that destruction even the rulers betook themselves to flight;
but they derived no advantage from their flight, nor did Jerusalem afford them
any defense, for they fell into the hands of their
enemies.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he expressly mentions the
<i>rulers</i>, this shews more strongly the shamefulness of the transaction, for
they ought to have been the first to expose their persons for the safety of the
people. They might be viewed as the shields which ought to have guarded and
defended the common people. So long as Jerusalem kept its ground and was in a
prosperous condition, these statements might be thought incredible, for it was a
very strong and powerfully fortified city. But they chiefly boasted of the
protection of God, for they thought that in some way God was bound to his
"Temple; " and their pride swelled them with the confident hope that, though all
should be leagued against it, no power and no armies could bring it down.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240704&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
7:4.) This prophecy might therefore be thought very strange, that they would
have no courage, that they would betake themselves to flight, and that even in
that manner they could not escape.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore I said.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet, in order to affect more
deeply the hearts of the Jews, assumes the character of a mourner, and not only
so, but bitterly bewails the distressed condition of the Church of God. This
passage must not be explained in the same manner as some former passages, in
which he described the grief and sorrow of foreign nations; but he speaks of the
fallen condition of the Church of which he is a member, and therefore he
sincerely bewails it, and invites others by his example to join in the
lamentation. What has befallen the Church ought to affect us in the same manner
as if it had befallen each of us individually; for otherwise what would become
of that passage? "The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;196909&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
69:9.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will be bitter in my
weeping.
</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F335</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He does not mourn in secret, or without witnesses; first, because he wishes, as
I have already said, to excite others by his example to lamentation, and not to
lamentation only, but much more to repentance, that they may ward off the
dreadful judgment of God against them, which was close at hand, and henceforth
may refrain from provoking his displeasure; and secondly, because it was proper
that the herald of God's wrath should actually make evident that what he utters
is not mockery.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because of the
spoiling of the daughter of my people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> That he
expresses the feelings of his own heart may be inferred from what he now
declares, that he is bitterly grieved "on account of the daughter of his
people." Being one of the family of Abraham, he thought that this distress
affected his own condition, and intimates that he has good grounds for
lamentation. By a customary mode of expression he calls the assembly of his
people a <i>daughter</i>. Hence it ought to be observed, that whenever the
Church is afflicted, the example of the Prophet ought to move us to be touched
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sumpaqei&gt;a|</font><font face="Palatino">)
with compassion, if we are not harder than iron; for we are altogether unworthy
of being reckoned in the number of the children of God, and added to the holy
Church, if we do not dedicate ourselves, and all that we have, to the Church, in
such a manner that we are not separate from it in any respect. Thus, when in the
present day the Church is afflicted by so many and so various calamities, and
innumerable souls are perishing, which Christ redeemed with his own blood, we
must be barbarous and savage if we are not touched with any grief. And
especially the ministers of the word ought to be moved by this feeling of grief,
because, being appointed to keep watch and to look at a distance, they ought
also to groan when they perceive the tokens of approaching
ruin.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The circumstance of his weeping publicly
tended, as we have said, to soften the hearts of the people; for he had to deal
with obstinate men, who could not easily be induced to lament. There is a
passage that closely resembles it in Jeremiah, who bewails the miserable and
wasted condition of the people, and says, that through grief "his heart
fainteth,"</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F336</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240431&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
4:31;) and in another passage, "O that my head were full of waters, and mine
eyes a fountain of tears, that I might bewail the slain of my people!"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
9:1.) When the prophets saw that they labored in vain to subdue the obstinacy of
the people, they could not avoid being altogether overwhelmed by grief and
sorrow. They therefore endeavored, by their moving addresses, to soften hard
hearts, that they might bend them, if it were at all possible, and bring them
back to the right path.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It is a day of trouble.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He again declares that the Lord is the author
of this calamity, and that the Jews may not gaze around in all directions, or
wonder that their enemies prevail against them, he pronounces that they are
fighting against God. Though this doctrine is frequently taught in Scripture,
still it is not superfluous, and cannot be so earnestly inculcated as not to be
forgotten when we come to practice. The consequence is, that we are not humbled
in the presence of our Judge, and that we direct our eyes to outward remedies
rather than to God, who alone could cure our distresses. He employs the word
<i>day</i>, as is usual in Scripture, to signify an appointed time; for when God
winks at the transgressions of men, he appears to make some abatement of the
claims of his rank, which, however, he may be said to receive back again at the
proper and appointed time.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In
the valley of vision.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is not without good
reason that he again calls it "the valley of vision," for the Jews believed that
they would be protected against every calamitous event, because the Lord shone
on them by the word. But having ungratefully rejected his instruction, they
vainly trusted that it would be of avail to them; and indeed the Lord punishes
the unbelief of men, not only out of the Church, but within the Church itself;
and not only so, but he begins his chastisement at the Church, so that we must
not abuse the gifts of God, or vainly glory in his name.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1

This may refer either to God or to the Babylonians, or even to the exiles
themselves. Conquerors raise a cry for the sake of increasing terror, and the
vanquished either utter what is fitted to awaken compassion, or give vent to
their grief by lamentation. The singular number may be taken for the plural, or
rather it denotes that part of the city in which the temple was situated. Both
meanings will agree well with the context, and it makes little difference
whether we say that the enemies cried to Mount Zion, in order to encourage each
other, or that, while they were destroying and plundering the city, a cry was
heard in the neighboring mountains, or that the citizens themselves caused their
lamentations to resound to the mountains which surrounded the plain of Judea.

discourse proceeds without any interruption, and that he makes known to the Jews
the same judgment which he formerly proclaimed. But when I examine the whole
matter more closely, I am constrained to differ from them. I think that the
Prophet reproaches the Jews for their obstinacy and rebellion, because, though
the Lord had chastised them, they did not repent, and that he relates the
history of a past transaction, in order to remind them how utterly they had
failed to derive advantage from the Lord's chastisements. Such then is the
manner in which these statements ought to be separated from what came before.
First, he foretold those things which would come on the Jews, and now he shews
how justly they are punished, and how richly they deserve those sharp
chastisements which the Lord inflicts on them; for the Lord had formerly called
them to repentance, not only by words, but by deeds, and yet no reformation of
life followed, though their riches were exhausted, and the kingdom weakened, but
they obstinately persisted in their wickedness. Nothing therefore remained but
that the Lord should miserably destroy them, since they were obstinate and
refractory.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The copulative

(<i>vau</i>) I have translated <i>But</i>, which is the meaning that it
frequently bears. Those who think that the Prophet threatens for a future
period, preserve its ordinary meaning, as if the Prophet, after having mentioned
God, named the executioners of his vengeance. But I have already given the
exposition which I prefer, and the context will make it still more clear, that I
had good reasons for being of that opinion.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When
he speaks of the "Elamites" and the "Cyrenaeans," this applies better, I think,
to the Assyrians than to the Babylonians; for although those nations had never
make war against the Jews by troops under their own command, yet it is probable
that they were in the pay of the Assyrian king, and that they formed part of his
army while he was besieging Jerusalem. We have already remarked that, taking a
part for the whole, by the "Elamites" are meant the eastern
nations.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was full of
chariots.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I do not find fault with the
translation given by some interpreters, "in a chariot of horsemen," but I have
chosen rather to translate literally the words of the Prophet; for I think that
he means "a military chariot." At that time they made use of two kinds of
chariots, one for carrying baggage, and another for the field of battle. Here he
means those chariots in which the horsemen
rode.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Had it been a threatening, it would have
been proper to translate it in the future tense, "And it shall be; " but as the
words which immediately follow are in the past tense, and as there is reason to
believe that the Prophet is relating events which have already taken place, I
have not hesitated to make this beginning agree with what follows. "The choice
of the valleys" means "the choicest valleys." He reminds the Jews of those
straits to which they were reduced when the enemies were at their gates. They
ought at that time to have sought help from God; but those wretched people
became more strongly alienated from God, and more shamefully manifested their
rebellion, which shewed them to be men utterly abandoned, and therefore he
reproaches them with this hardened
obstinacy.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he took away the covering of
Judah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He shews in what distress of mind the
Jews were when they were so closely besieged. Some refer this verb to God, and
others to the enemy; but I rather think it ought to be taken indefinitely, for
by a mode of expression frequently used in the Hebrew language, "he took away,"
means that "the covering of Judah was taken away." By the word <i>covering</i>
almost all think that either the Temple or God himself is meant, in whose name
the Jews falsely boasted. But I interpret it more simply as denoting the armory,
in which, as a secret place, they kept the instruments of war. He calls it a
"covering," because they were not exposed to public view, but were concealed in
a more sacred place. In short, he describes what commonly happens in a season of
great alarm, because at such a time men run to arms, and the instruments of war,
which had been formerly concealed, are brought
forward.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou didst look
in that day to the armory of the house of the
forest.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This latter clause agrees with what has
been remarked, that they sought out, on such an occasion, every place which
contained the means of arming themselves for a case of extreme urgency, the
instruments of war having lain long concealed during peace. Sacred history
informs us, that this "house of the forest" was built by Solomon, in order to
contain the armory of the whole
kingdom.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F342</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;110702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 7:2.) The change of person, <i>thou didst look</i>, does not obscure the
meaning, but rather confirms what I have already remarked, that the Prophet
relates how eagerly the Jews at that time made every preparation for defending
the city.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And you have seen the
breaches.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He proceeds with his narrative, for
during prosperity and peace no one cares about bulwarks or instruments of war.
It is necessity alone that arouses men and makes them active; peace and
quietness make us indolent and cowardly. So long as they thought that they were
far from danger, they disregarded the breaches of the wall; but when a report of
war arose, they began to be anxious about them, and to make arrangements for
preventing the entrance of the
enemy.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Of the city of
David.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By "the city of David," he means the
interior part of the city; for, like many other cities which we see, the city
was divided into two parts. The whole of Jerusalem was surrounded by walls and
ramparts; but the interior part was more strongly fortified, and was called "the
city of David." The Temple was afterwards fortified, in consequence of which the
city might be said to consist of three parts. Isaiah means that the Jews had
nearly despaired as to the safety of the whole city, when they withdrew to the
inmost and best fortified part of it; and indeed it is evident from sacred
history that everything was in a desperate condition. Hence also we may infer,
that the prophecies were not collected in a regular order, and that those who

necessary purposes, that the besieged might not be in want of it, and that the
pool served for cisterns.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And you numbered the houses of
Jerusalem.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He means that the city was closely
examined on all sides, that there might not be a house or building which was not
defended. Others think that the houses were numbered, that they might have a
supply of watchmen. But the former interpretation is preferable, and is
confirmed by what the Prophet afterwards adds, that the houses were thrown down
for the purpose of rebuilding the walls of the city. This is commonly neglected
in the time of peace, and the houses of private individuals are often built on
the very walls, and, on that account, must be thrown down in the time of war, to
supply the means of fighting and of repelling the enemy, and also lest, by means
of houses so near the wall, secret communications with the enemy should be
maintained.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>You made also a
ditch.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The first clause of this verse relates
to the former subjects; for he means that they were reduced to the last
necessity, and that the great approaching danger struck them with terror, so
that they adopted every method in their power for defending themselves against
the enemy.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And you have not
looked to its Maker.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This second clause
reproves them for carelessness, because they had given their whole attention to
earthly assistance, and had neglected that which is of the greatest importance.
Instead of resorting first of all to God, as they ought to have done, they
forgot and despised him, and directed their attention to ramparts, and ditches,
and walls, and other preparations of war; but their highest defense was in God.
What I said at first is now more evident, that the Prophet does not foretell the
destruction of the Jews, but declares what they have experienced, in order to
shew how justly the Lord was angry with them, because they could not be amended
or reformed by any chastisement. The alarming dangers to which they were exposed
ought to have warned them against their impiety and contempt of God; but those
dangers have made them still more obstinate. Though there is hardly any person
so obstinate as not to be induced by adversity, and especially by imminent
dangers, to bethink himself, and to consider if they have justly befallen him,
if he has offended God and provoked his wrath against himself; yet the Prophet
says, that there was not one of the Jews who remembered God in the midst of such
distresses, and that therefore God justly ceased to take any concern about
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence infer that it is a token of extreme
and desperate wickedness, when men, after having received chastisements or
afflictions, are not made better. We ought, first, to follow God and to render
to him cheerful obedience; and secondly, when we have been practically warned
and chastised, we ought to repent. And if stripes do us no good, what remains
but that the Lord shall increase and double the strokes, and cause us to feel
them heavier and heavier till we are hurled down to destruction? For it is vain
to apply remedies to a desperate and incurable disease. This doctrine is highly
applicable to our own times, in which so many strokes and afflictions urge us to
repentance. Since there is no repentance, what remains but that the Lord shall
try to the very utmost what can be done until he destroy us
altogether?</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To its
maker.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By these words he indirectly
acknowledges that God does not blame our eagerness to repel the enemy and to
guard against dangers; but that he blames the vain confidence which we place in
outward defences. We ought to have begun with God; and when we disregard him,
and resort to swords and spears, to bulwarks and fortifications, our excessive
eagerness is justly condemned as treason. Let us therefore learn to flee to God
in imminent dangers, and to betake ourselves, with our whole heart, to the sure
refuge of his name.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;201810&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
18:10.) When this has been done, it will be lawful for us to use the remedies
which he puts into our hand; but all will end in our ruin if we do not first
commit our safety to his protection.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He calls

132:13, 14.) Though this may relate to the creation of the whole world, yet the

2:1,) regenerates, and sanctifies us, (Psalms 110:3,) is peculiar to the elect,
the rest have no share in it. This title does not express a sudden but a
continual act, for the Church was not at once created that it might afterwards
be forsaken, but the Lord preserves and defends it to the last. "Thou wilt not
despise the work of thy hands," says the Psalmist. (Psalms 138:8.) And Paul
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"He who hath begun a good

1:6.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This title contains astonishing consolation, for if
God is the maker, we have no reason to fear if we depend on his power and
goodness. But we cannot <i>look</i> to him unless we are endued with true
humility and confidence, so that, being divested of all haughtiness and reduced
to nothing, we ascribe the glory to him alone. This cannot be, unless we can
also trust that our salvation is in his hand, and are fully convinced that we
shall never perish, even though we be surrounded by a thousand deaths. It was an
aggravation of their baseness, that the Lord's election of that city, which had
been established by so many proofs, could not arouse the Jews to rely on the
protection of God. As if he had said, What madness is it to think of defending
the city when you despise him who made
it!</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From a
distance,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or <i>long ago</i>. The Hebrew word
denotes either distance of place or length of time. If we refer it to place, the
meaning will be, that the Jews are doubly ungrateful, because they have not
beheld the Lord even at a distance. Here it ought to be observed, that we ought
to look to God not only when he is near, but also when he appears to be at a
very great distance from us. Now, we think that he is absent, when we do not
perceive his present aid, and when he does not instantly supply our wants. In
short, he shews what is the nature of true hope; for it is a carnal and gross
looking at God, when we do not perceive his providence unless by visible favor,
since we ought to ascend above the heavens themselves. Strictly and truly, no
doubt, the Lord is always present, but he is said to be distant and absent with
respect to us. This must be understood therefore to refer to our senses, and not
to the fact itself; and therefore, although he appear to be at a distance during
those calamities which the Church endures, still we ought to elevate our minds
towards him, and arouse our hearts, and shake off our indolence, that we may
call on him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But the other meaning is equally
admissible, that they did not look to God who created his Church, not yesterday
or lately, but long ago, and who had proved himself to be her Maker during many
ages. He is therefore called the ancient Maker of his Church, because if the
Jews will apply their thoughts and careful search to the long succession of
ages, they will perceive that he is the perpetual preserver of his workmanship;
and this makes their ingratitude the less
excusable.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord of hosts
called.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The wicked obstinacy of the people is
exhibited by the Prophet with additional aggravations. What left them altogether
without excuse was the fact, that while they were exposed to so great dangers,
they despised the godly remonstrances of the prophets, and rejected the grace of
God, when he wished to heal and restore them. It is a proof of consummate
depravity, when men have so completely laid aside all feeling that they
fearlessly despise both instruction and chastisements, and obstinately "kick
against the pricks,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;440905&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
9:5,) and this makes it evident that they have been "given over to a reprobate
mind."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:28.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he says, that "the Lord called"
them, this may be explained in two ways; for although the Lord does not speak,
still he calls loudly enough by stripes and chastisements. Let it be supposed
that we are destitute of all Scripture, of prophets, teachers, and advisers,
still he instructs us by distresses and afflictions, so that we may state, in a
few words, that every chastisement is a <i>call</i> to repentance. But,
unquestionably, the Prophet intended to express something more, namely, that in
despising godly warnings, they did not scruple to treat with scorn God's
fatherly invitation.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that
day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There is great weight also in mentioning
<i>the day</i> of affliction, when danger threatened them, for they were
admonished at the same time by the word and by strokes. The signs of God's anger
were visible, the prophets uttered incessant cries, and still they became no
better.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To baldness and
girding with sackcloth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When he mentions
<i>sackcloth</i> and <i>baldness</i>,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F343</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he employs the signs themselves to describe repentance; for repentance does not
consist in sackcloth or haircloth,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F344</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
or anything outward, but has its place in the heart. Those who sincerely repent
are displeased with themselves, hate sin, and are affected with such a deep
feeling of grief, that they abhor themselves and their past life; but as this
cannot be done without, at the same time, making itself known by confession
before men, on this account he describes the outward signs by which we give
evidence of our conversion. Now, these things were at that time cast away among
the Jews, when they made public declarations of repentance. The Prophet
therefore means that they were called to repentance, to humble themselves before
God, and to exhibit the evidences of repentance before men. Of themselves,
indeed, the signs would not be sufficient, for repentance begins at the heart;
and Joel gives warning to that effect,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Rend your hearts, and
not your garments."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;290213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Joel
2:13.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Not that he wished signs to be laid aside, but he
shewed that they are not sufficient, and that of themselves they are not
acceptable to God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence infer what is our duty,
when the tokens of God's anger are visible to us. We ought to declare publicly
our repentance, not only before God, but also before men. The outward
ceremonies, indeed, are of little consequence, and we are not commanded to wear
sackcloth or to pull out our hair; but we must practice honestly and sincerely
what is actually meant by these signs, disapprobation and confession of our
guilt, humility of the heart, and reformation of the life. If we do not confess
that we are guilty, and that we deserve punishment, we shall not return to a
state of favor with God. In short, as culprits allow their beards to grow, and
wear tattered clothes, in order to affect the hearts of the judges, so we ought
to betake ourselves as suppliants to the mercy of God, and make a public
declaration of our repentance.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But here we ought
also to observe the usefulness of outward signs of repentance; for they serve as
spurs to prompt us more to know and abhor sin. In this way, so far as they are
spurs, they may be called causes of repentance; and so far as they are
evidences, they may be called effects. They are causes, because the marks of our
guilt, which we carry about us, excite us the more to acknowledge ourselves to
be sinners and guilty; and they are effects, because, if they were not preceded
by repentance, we would never be induced to perform them
sincerely.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And, behold, joy and
gladness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet does not here find fault
with <i>joy</i> viewed in itself; for we see that Paul exhorts the godly to true
joy, the "joy" which is "in the Lord,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;500404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
4:4;) but now he censures the joy which is opposite to that sadness which
commonly springs from repentance, of which Paul also speaks.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470710&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 7:10.) No man can be under the influence of repentance and of a
sincere feeling of the wrath of God, without being led, by the grief which
accompanies it, willingly to afflict himself The joy which is opposite to this
grief is therefore sinful, because it proceeds from brutish indifference, and is
justly blamed, since the Lord curses it.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;420625&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
6:25.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Slaying oxen and
killing sheep.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> From what has been said, it is
easy to see the reason why he censures them for "slaying oxen and killing
sheep." These things are not in themselves sinful, and are not displeasing to
God; but as fasting is a part of a solemn declaration of repentance, which we
make before men, so to slay cattle for feasting, when we ought to fast, is a
proof of obstinacy and contempt of God; for in this way men despise God's
threatenings, and encourage themselves in their
crimes.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Such is the statement which Isaiah
intended to make in general terms. But it is absurd in the Papists to think of
drawing from it an approbation of abstinence from eating flesh. Why do they not
also include what the Apostle adds about wine? They are so far from abstaining
from the use of wine, that they freely indulge in drinking it, as a compensation
for the want of flesh. But let us pass over these absurdities. Isaiah does not
absolutely condemn the use of flesh or the drinking of wine, but he condemns the
luxury and wantonness by which men are hardened in such a manner that they
obstinately set aside God's threatenings, and treat as false all that the
prophets tell them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This ought to be carefully
observed, for we do not always wear sackcloth and ashes; but we cannot have true
repentance without making it manifest by the fruits which it must unavoidably
produce. In short, as he had described repentance by its signs, so he marks out
obstinacy by its signs; for as by fasting and other outward acts we testify our
repentance, so by feasting and luxury we give proofs of an obstinate heart, and
thus provoke more the wrath of God, in a similar manner to what we read about
the days of Noah.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
6:5;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402438&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
24:38, 39;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;421727&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
17:27.) After having described intemperance and luxury in general terms, he
particularly mentions eating and drinking, in which the Jews indulged to such an
extent as if they had been able, in some measure, to combat the wrath of God,
and to obliterate the remembrance of his
threatening</font><br><font face="Palatino">For to-morrow we shall die. This
clause shews plainly enough why the Prophet complained so loudly about eating
flesh and drinking wine. It was because all the threatenings uttered by the
prophets were turned by them into a subject of jesting and laughter. It is
supposed that Paul quotes this passage, when, in writing to the Corinthians, he
uses nearly the same words.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461532&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 15:32.) But I am of a different opinion; for he quotes the opinion
of the Epicureans, who lived for the passing day, and gave themselves no concern
about eternal life, and therefore thought that they should follow their natural
disposition, and enjoy pleasures as long as life lasted. Isaiah, on the other
hand, relates here the speeches of wicked men, who obstinately ridiculed the
threatenings of the prophets, and could not patiently endure to be told about
chastisements, banishment, slaughter, and ruin. They employed the words of the
prophets, and in the midst of their feasting and revelry, turned them into
ridicule, saying, in a boasting strain,
"</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To-morrow we shall
die</i></font><font face="Palatino">. If the prophets tell us that our
destruction is at hand, let us pass the present day, at least, in cheerfulness
and mirth."</font><br><font face="Palatino">Thus, obstinate minds cannot be
struck with any terror, but, on the contrary, mock at God and the prophets, and
give themselves up more freely to licentiousness. It certainly was frightful
madness when, through indignation and wrath, they quoted with bitter irony the
words which not only ought to have affected their minds, but ought to have
shaken heaven and earth. Would that there were not instances of the same kind in
the present day! For whenever God threatens, the greater part of men either
vomit out their bitterness, or sneeringly ridicule everything that has proceeded
from God's holy mouth.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is revealed.
</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F345</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
As if he had said, "Do you think that you can escape punishment for your
wantonness, when God calls you to repentance?" It might be thought that here the
Prophet says nothing that is new; for undoubtedly all things are known to God.
But he adds this for the purpose of shaking off the indolence of men, who never
would rise so fiercely against God, if they did not think that they could
deceive him; for whosoever knows that God is his witness, must also acknowledge
that God is his judge. Hence it follows that wicked men, in their wantonness,
rob God of his power; and therefore it is not without reason that they are
summoned to his tribunal, that they may know that they must render an account to
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If this iniquity shall be
forgiven you till you die.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He adds a dreadful
threatening, that this wickedness shall never be forgiven. In the Hebrew
language, the conditional particle, <i>if</i>, contains a denial, as if the Lord
had said, "Do not think that I am true, or that I have any divine perfections,
<i>if</i> I do not take vengeance on so great wickedness." The reason why the
Jews, in their oaths, reserve something which is not expressed, is to accustom
us to deeper reverence in this matter; for we entreat God to be our Judge and
avenger if we speak falsely, and therefore we ought to restrain ourselves, so as
not to make oaths at random. Here Isaiah states generally, that nothing is so
displeasing to God as impenitence, by which, as Paul says,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450205&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
2:5,) we "heap up for ourselves the treasures of God's wrath," and shut out all
hope of pardon.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is a special prediction against a
single individual; for, having spoken of the whole nation, he turns to Shebna,
whom he will afterwards mention.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
37:2.) To this person the Prophet gives two titles, that of "scribe" or
"chancellor," and that of "steward of the house," for while in this passage he
calls him "steward," in the thirty-seventh chapter he calls him "scribe." This
has led some to think that, at the time of this prediction, he had resigned his
office as steward, and that Eliakim was put in his room. But this is uncertain,
though the words of the Prophet, in reference to Shebna himself, lead us to
conclude that he cherished wicked envy, which led him to attempt to degrade
Eliakim from his rank. Nor is it improbable that this prediction was uttered,
when Sennacherib's army was discomfited, and Jerusalem was saved in a miraculous
manner.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121935&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 19:35;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233736&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
37:36.) During the interval, many things might have happened which are now
unknown to us; and it is not improbable that this treacherous scoundrel, having
obtained the highest authority, made an unjust use of it to the injury of
Eliakim. It is evident, from the history of the Book of Kings, that Shebna was a
"scribe" or "secretary," and one of high rank, such as we now call
chancellor.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There is greater difficulty about
the word!
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;ks</font><font face="Palatino">,

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;ks</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>sachan</i>) signifies <i>to store up</i>; but, as he elsewhere calls him
"chancellor," I think it is not probable that he was treasurer. Besides, the
Prophet shews plainly enough that his office as governor was such as allowed
others to have scarcely any share of authority along with him. Such a rank could
not belong to a treasurer, and therefore I think that the Prophet means
something else. As!
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;ks</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>sachan</i>) sometimes signifies "to abet," and "to foment,"!
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;ks</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>sochen</i>) may here mean "an abettor," or, as we commonly say, "an
accomplice." It is certain that this Shebna had communications with the enemy,
and was a cunning and deceitful person; for he cherished a concealed friendship
with the Egyptians and Assyrians, and held treacherous communications with them,
so as to provide for his own safety in any event that might arise, and to
maintain his authority.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Others think that!
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;ks</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>sochen</i>) is a word denoting the country to which he belonged, and that he
was called a Sochnite from the city of which he was a native; for he is said to
have been all Egyptian. I certainly do not reject that opinion, but I prefer the
former; for he <i>abetted</i> both sides, and thought that, by his cunning, he
would be preserved, even though everything should be turned upside
down.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hzh</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>hazzeh</i>,) this, is evidently added in contempt. It is as if he had said,
"<i>That</i> cunning man, ready for all shifts,

who abets various parties, who curries favor on all sides." In this sense!

Kings 1:2) when it relates to a maid who was about to be brought to the aged
king in order to <i>cherish</i> him. Yet, if it be thought preferable to
understand it as meaning a hurtful and injurious person, I do not object, for
the word signifies also "to
impoverish."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What hast thou
here?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Shebna had built a sepulcher at
Jerusalem, as if he were to live there continually, and to die there. The
Prophet therefore asks why he built a splendid and costly sepulcher in a lofty
and conspicuous place, as is commonly done by those who wish to perpetuate the
memory of their name in the world. He appears to glance at the ambition of a
foreigner and a stranger in longing to be so magnificently buried out of his
country, and yet eagerly joining with enemies for the destruction of Judea What
could have been more foolish than to erect a monument in that country for whose
ruin he was plotting? And therefore he adds
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, the Lord will carry thee
away.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As if he had said, "Thou shalt be cast
out of that place into a distant country, where thou shalt die ignominiously."
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rbg</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>geber</i>) is commonly translated as in the genitive case; that is, "with
the casting out of a man thou shalt be cast out." Again,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rbg</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>geber</i>) denotes not an ordinary man, but a strong and brave man, and thus
it comes to mean, "with a mighty and powerful casting out." Others render it in
the vocative case, "O man!" as if he were addressing Shebna in mockery, "O
illustrious man, who so proudly vauntest of thy greatness, who thinkest that
thou art some hero!" But the former reading will be more appropriate. Yet here
also commentators disagree; for, besides the exposition which I have mentioned,
another is brought forward, that <i>men</i> will be carried to a greater
distance than women. But I rather think that he alludes to the pride of Shebna,
who had built so splendid a sepulcher, in order that his memory, like that of
some distinguished man, might be handed down to posterity. "Thou wishest to be
renowned after thy death: I will ennoble thee in a different manner. By a
remarkable transportation will I remove thee to a foreign and distant country,
where thou shalt be buried in an extraordinary
manner."</font><br><font face="Palatino">First, on the word!
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;ks</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>sochen</i>) it is proper to remark how much God is displeased with a false
and deceitful heart; for there is nothing which God more earnestly recommends to
us than simplicity. He is called a ruler, because, being placed above others, he
was likely to be dazzled by the luster of his present greatness, as happens to
those who, elated and puffed up by their success, dread no adversity, as if they
had been placed beyond the reach of all danger. The Lord threatens that he will
be the judge of such persons. Here it also deserves notice, that Isaiah could
not, without making himself the object of strong dislike, utter this prediction,
especially when addressed to a man of such an elevated station and so haughty;
and yet he must not refuse this office, but must approach and threaten this man,
as God had commanded him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As to the
<i>sepulcher</i>, we know that solicitude about burying the dead is not wholly
condemned; for although "the want of burial," as one remarks, "is of little
importance, yet the desire of being buried is natural to man, and ought not to
be entirely disregarded." He does not blame him, therefore, for wishing, to be
buried, but for his ambition in building a tomb, by which he shewed his
eagerness to obtain vain and empty renown. But there is another circumstance
connected with Shebna that must be observed; for, having wished to deliver the
city into the hands of the Assyrians by treachery, he thought that he would
reign permanently. He hoped that the Assyrians, if they were successful, would
bestow on him the government of the kingdom as the reward of his treachery, and
that, if they were defeated, he would permanently retain his rank and
authority.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But this will appear more clearly
from the words themselves, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What
hast thou here?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He was a foreigner, and as such
he could honestly become united to the people of God; but, being a traitor and a
foreigner, he had no right to that city or country which the Lord had specially
assigned to his own people. Isaiah therefore asks, "Of what country art thou?
Though thou hast no connection with the people of God by blood or relationship,
dost thou wish not only to reign in this country during thy life, but to procure
for thyself a settled abode in it after thou art dead? Wilt thou betray us to
the Assyrians, and drive out the actual possessors, that thou, who art a
foreigner, mayest enjoy that country, of which not even an inch belongs to
thee?"</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence infer that God is highly displeased
with that ambition by which men endeavor to obtain undying renown in the world,
instead of being satisfied with those honors which they enjoy during their life.
They wish to be applauded after death, and in some measure to live in the mouth
of men; and although death sets aside everything, they foolishly hope that their
name will last through all ages. But God punishes their haughtiness and
presumption, and causes those things which they wished to be the records of
their glory to become their disgrace and shame. Either their memory is abhorred,
so that men cannot see or hear anything connected with them without utter
loathing, or he does not even permit them to be laid in their graves, but sends
them to gibbets and to ravens, of which we read many instances in history,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;170710&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Esther
7:10,) and we have seen not a few in our own
times.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Whenever I read this passage, I am
forcibly reminded of a similar instance, resembling it indeed more closely than
any other, that of Thomas More, who held the same office as Shebna; for it is
well known that he was Lord Chancellor to the king of England. Having been a
very bitter enemy of the gospel, and having persecuted good men by fire and
sword, he wished that on this account his reputation should be extensive, and
his wickedness and cruelty permanently recorded. He therefore ordered the
praises of his virtue to be inscribed on a tomb which he had caused to be built
with great cost and splendor, and sent his epitaph, which he had drawn up, to
Basle, to Erasmus, along with a palfrey which he gave him as a present, to get
it printed. He was so desirous of renown, that he wished to obtain during his
life the reputation and praises which he hoped to enjoy after his death. Among
other applauses the most conspicuous was, that he had been a very great
persecutor of the Lutherans, that is, of the godly.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F346</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
What happened? He was accused of treason, condemned, and beheaded; and thus he
had a gibbet for his tomb. Do we ask more manifest judgments of God, by which he
punishes the pride, the unbounded eagerness for renown, and the blasphemous
vaunting, of wicked men? In this inveterate enemy of the people of God, not less
than in Shebna, we ought undoubtedly to acknowledge and adore God's overruling
providence.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Another circumstance worthy of
notice is, that this Shebna was a foreigner. Thus, all the tyrants and enemies
of the people of God, though they be foreigners, would wish to cast out the
actual lords of the soil, that they alone might possess the land; but at length
the Lord drives them out, and strips them of all possession, so that they do not
even continue to have a tomb.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F347</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
There are innumerable instances in history. True, this does not always happen;
but the instances which the Lord holds out to us, ought to lead our thoughts
farther to consider his judgments against tyrants and wicked men, who wished to
be applauded and celebrated, but are distinguished by some remarkable kind of
death, so that their infamy becomes universally known. Thus, the renown of that
sepulcher which Shebna had built is indirectly contrasted with the ignominy
which quickly followed it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Turning he will turn
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F348</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Isaiah continues the same discourse, in which he ridiculed the pride of Shebna,
who had bestowed so much cost on building a sepulcher. This statement is
connected with the first clause of the former verse; for, as he formerly said
"He will remove thee by an extraordinary removal so he now says, "He will toss
thee as a ball into an open plain." By this comparison he means that nothing
will prevent the Lord from casting him out into a distant country, though he
thinks that his power is firmly established; and since he had been so careful
about his sepulcher, and had given orders about it, as if he had been certain as
to his death, Isaiah declares that he will not die in Jerusalem, but in a
foreign country, to which he shall be
banished.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The chariot of thy
glory.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Under the word <i>chariot</i> he
includes all the fame and rank of Shebna; as if he had said that disgrace would
be his reputation among foreigners. Thus, the Lord ridicules the mad ambition of
those who look at nothing but the world, and who judge of their happiness by the
glory of fading and transitory
objects.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The shame of thy
lord's house.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He calls it "the shame of" the
royal "house," either because he had polluted that holy place which might be
regarded as the sanctuary of the Lord, or because Hezekiah had judged ill in
elevating him to that station. That the mask of his high rank might not screen
him from this prediction, the Prophet expressly states, that the office which he
holds aggravates his guilt and renders him more detestable. Let princes,
therefore, if they do not wish to expose themselves and their houses to
reproaches, learn to act with judgment in appointing men to hold
office.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will cast thee
out.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He says nothing new, but concludes the
former prediction. Though in the next verse he will again mention Shebna, yet
now he gives a brief summary of what has been already said. Shebna thought that
he had a fixed abode in Jerusalem, so that, whatever might happen, he thought
that he could not be driven or removed from it. But the Lord threatens that he
will cast him out, and will banish him to a distant country. Thus, the Lord
frequently overturns the thoughts of the wicked,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
33:10,) who, relying on their cunning and dexterity, toss about public affairs
according to their own pleasure. The change of person shews that the Prophet
speaks sometimes in his own name, and sometimes in the name of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall come to pass in that
day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is uncertain at what time Eliakim was
substituted in the room of Shebna; for we shall see, in the thirty-seventh
chapter, that Eliakim was steward of the king's house when Shebna was
chancellor. Whether or not any change took place during the interval cannot with
certainty be affirmed; yet it is probable, as I lately hinted, that through the
stratagems of this wicked man, Eliakim was afterwards driven from his office,
and that Shebna, after having triumphed, was punished for his frauds which had
been detected, and, having been driven or banished from Judea, fled to the
Assyrians, and there received the reward of his treachery. In like manner does
it frequently happen to traitors, who, when they cannot fulfill their
engagements, are hated and abhorred by those whom they have deceived; for,
having been bold and rash in promising, they must be discovered to be false and
treacherous.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Jews allege that at last he was
torn in pieces on account of his treachery, but no history supports that
statement. Leaving that matter doubtful, it is certain that he was cast out or
banished, and that he ended his days in a foreign country, and not at Jerusalem.
It is probable that, after his banishment, Eliakim was again placed in his
room.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
call.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is certain that all princes and
magistrates are called by the Lord, even though they be wicked and ungodly; for
"all authority is from God," as Paul affirms.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
13:1.) But here the Prophet speaks of a peculiar <i>calling</i>, by which the
Lord manifests his goodness towards his people, when he appoints such persons to
be his servants, that it may be known that God governs by them; and they, on the
other hand, are well aware of the purpose for which they have been appointed by
God, and faithfully discharge the office assigned to them. Shebna had indeed
been <i>called</i> for a time, but it was that he might be God's scourge; for
nothing was farther from his thoughts than to obey God. Eliakim was a different
kind of person; for he acknowledged himself to be a servant of God, and obeyed
the holy calling.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
call,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> means, therefore, "I will give a sign to
my servant, that he may know that it is I who have raised him to that honorable
rank." There is in this case a peculiar relation between the master and the
servant, which does not apply to ungodly men when they obey their own
inclination and wicked passions; but this man acknowledged the Lord and
sincerely obeyed him. Lastly, this mark distinguishes the true servant of God
from a wicked and hypocritical person, who had risen to honor by wicked
practices.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And I will clothe him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now explains more
fully what he had briefly noticed in the former verse, that it was only by the
purpose of God that Shebna was deposed, in order that Eliakim might succeed him.
It is true, indeed, that all the changes that happen in the world are directed
by the providence of God; for he "girds kings with a girdle," as we are told in
the book of Job, "and ungirds them, according to his pleasure."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;181218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
12:18.) A witty saying was at one time current about the Roman emperors "that
they were theatrical kings; " because, as players, who perform their parts in
the theater, no sooner have laid aside the rank of a king, than they presently
become poor mechanics; so the emperors, after having been thrown down from their
lofty station, were speedily hurried to a disgraceful punishment. And yet it is
certain that those insurrections did not take place by chance, or merely through
the designs of men, or by military forces, but by the purpose of God, which
directed the whole. But the Prophet declares, that there is this peculiarity in
the case of Shebna, that his deposition will be a clear proof of the vengeance
of God, and that the restoration of Eliakim will be regarded as a lawful form of
government.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With thy robes and
with thy girdle.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By the <i>robes</i> and
<i>girdle</i> are meant the badges of the magistrates' office. The <i>girdle</i>
was an emblem of royalty, and the chief magistrates undoubtedly wore it as an
honorable distinction. At Rome, also, the praetors wore this badge. Job says,
that God ungirds kings when he deprives them of their royal rank.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;181218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
12:18.) These things were foretold by the Prophet, that all might not only see
clearly in this instance the providence of God, and acknowledge his purpose, but
might perceive that this wicked man, who had raised himself improperly and by
unlawful methods, was justly
deposed.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He shall be
Father.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Wicked magistrates are indeed appointed
by God, but it is in his anger, and because we do not deserve to be placed under
his government. He gives a loose rein to tyrants and wicked men, in order to
punish our ingratitude, as if he had forsaken or ceased to govern us. But when
good magistrates rule, we see God, as it were, near us, and governing us by
means of those whom he hath appointed. The Prophet means that Eliakim will
perform the part of a father, because he has been endued with the Spirit of God.
At the same time he reminds all godly persons that they will have good reasons
for wishing the government of Eliakim, because it tends to the general advantage
of the Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By the appellation <i>father</i>,
he shews what is the duty of a good magistrate. The same thing has been taught
by heathen writers, that "a good king holds the place of a father; " and when
they wished to flatter those who crushed the commonwealth by the exercise of
tyranny, nature suggested to them to call the tyrants by the honorable title of
"fathers of their country." In like manner, philosophers, when they say that a
family is the picture of a kingdom, shew that a king ought to hold the place of
a father. This is also proved by the ancient titles given to kings, such as
"Abimelech,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012002&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
20:2, 8,) that is, "my father the king," and others of the same kind, which shew
that royal authority cannot be separated from the feelings of a father. Those
who wish to be regarded as lawful princes, and to prove that they are God's
servants, must therefore shew that they are fathers to their
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the key of the house of
David.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F349</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This expression is metaphorical, and we
need not spend much time, as some do, in drawing from it an allegorical meaning;
for it is taken from an ordinary custom of men. The keys of the house are
delivered to those who are appointed to be stewards, that they may have the full
power of opening and shutting according to their own pleasure. By "the house of
David" is meant "the royal house." This mode of expression was customary among
the people, because it had been promised to David that his kingdom would be for
ever.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;100713&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 7:13;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
132:11, 12.) That is the reason why the kingdom was commonly called "the house
of David."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><i>The key</i> is put in the singular
number for <i>keys</i>. Though "keys" are usually carried in the hands, yet he
says that they are laid on the
shoulders,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F350</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> because he is describing an important
charge. Yet nothing more is meant than that the charge and the whole government
of the house are committed to him, that he may regulate everything according to
his pleasure; and we know that the delivering of keys is commonly regarded as a
token of possession.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Some commentators have
viewed this passage as referring to Christ, but improperly; for the Prophet
draws a comparison between two men, Shebna and Eliakim. Shebna shall be deprived
of his office, and Eliakim shall succeed him. What has this to do with Christ?
For Eliakim was not a type of Christ, and the Prophet does not here describe any
hidden mystery, but borrows a comparison from the ordinary practice of men, as
if the keys were delivered to one who has been appointed to be steward, as has
been already said. For the same reason Christ calls the office of teaching the
word,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401619&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
16:19,) "the keys of the kingdom of heaven; " so that it is idle and foolish to
spend much time in endeavoring to find a hidden reason, when the matter is
plain, and needs no ingenuity. The reason is, that ministers, by the preaching
of the word, open the entrance into heaven, and lead to Christ, who alone is
"the way."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
14:6.) By <i>the keys</i>, therefore, he means here the government of the king's
house, because the principal charge of it would be delivered to Eliakim at the
proper time.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will fasten him as a nail

idea of the word is "truth;" for where "truth" is, there firmness and certainty
are found;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F351</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and therefore Hebrew writers employ the word "truth" to denote what is firm and
certain. Isaiah employs an elegant metaphor, from which godly magistrates, who
are few in number, ought to draw large consolation. They may conclude that not
only has God raised them to that honorable rank, but they are confirmed and
established, as if they had been <i>fixed</i> by his hand, And indeed, where the
fear of the Lord dwells, there the stability, and power, and authority of kings,
as Solomon says, are established by justice and judgment.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;201612&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
16:12; 25:5; 29:14.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">This consolation ought to
be of advantage to princes, not only that they may meet all danger courageously,
but likewise that they may firmly and resolutely proceed in their office, and
not turn aside on any account, or shrink from any danger. But there are very few
who call actually relish this doctrine. Almost all are like Jeroboam,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;111228&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 12:28,) and think that religion should yield to them, and, so far as they
imagine, that it will be of service to them, follow it, or rather bend and
change it for their own convenience. Their last thought is about God and
religion; and we need not wonder if they are always in doubt about their own
affairs, and are scarcely ever at rest; for they do not direct their thoughts to
him from whom all authority proceeds.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
13:1.) Hence springs treachery, hence springs cruelty, covetousness, violence,
and frauds and wrongs of every kind, in which the princes of the present day
indulge with less restraint and with greater impudence than all others. Yet
there are some in whom we see what is here said of Eliakim. The Lord guards and
upholds them, and blesses that regard to equity and justice which he had
bestowed upon them. If the Lord permits even tyrants for a time, because they
have some appearance of regular government, what shall happen when a prince
shall endeavor, to the utmost of his power, to defend justice and judgment, and
the true worship of God? Will he not be still more confirmed and established by
him who is the continual guardian of
righteousness?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall hang upon
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is as if he had said that Eliakim would
be fully qualified for discharging his duties, and would not be indolent in his
office. Hence we infer that God does not exalt princes to honor, in order that
they may live in indolence or gratify their own passions. The office of a prince
is very labourious, if he discharges it properly, and if he do not copy the
unmeaning countenances of those who imagine that they have been raised to that
honor, that they may live in splendor and may freely indulge in every kind of
luxury. If a prince wish to discharge his office in a proper manner, he must
endure much toil. It must not be thought that the comparison of a <i>nail</i> is
inapplicable to princely government, since it denotes an office full of activity
and cares; and we know that metaphors do not apply at all points, but we ought
to observe the purpose for which they are
introduced.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All the glory of

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F353</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The expression, "his father's house," leaves no room to doubt that Eliakim was
of royal blood; and therefore by his successors I understand not only those who
were nearly related to him, but the whole family of David. He will have the
charge of all that shall be in the king's house. By adding
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>grandchildren</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he likewise shews that this princely government will be of long duration, that
it will not only last during the life of one individual, but will also extend to
his successors.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F354</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For good princes are useful not only to their own age, but also to posterity, to
whom they leave good laws, salutary regulations, and the traces of good
government; so that their successors, even though they be wicked men, are
ashamed to give themselves up all at once to abandoned wickedness, and, even
against their will, are compelled through shame to retain something that is
good. He shews that this will be the case with Eliakim, whose government will be
so righteous that even posterity shall reap advantage from
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The smaller

Metaphorically it denotes that there will be uniform justice, or equal laws, as
the phrase is; and it is as if he had said, "He will not only support the
nobles, but will likewise attend to the interests of the lowest rank." The more
rarely this is found in a prince, so much higher praise does he deserve than if
he favored none but the rich and powerful; for these can guard and protect
themselves, but the poor and feeble lie open as a prey to the attacks of others,
and there is hardly any one that pleads their

In that day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It might be thought that this is
inconsistent with what he had formerly said; but he no longer speaks of Eliakim,
for he returns to Shebna, who was about to be cast down from his rank, as Isaiah
had said. But for this, it might have been thought that there was no way by
which Eliakim could arrive at that honor, but by the deposition of Shebna, who
had arranged his matters so well, that no person thought it possible that he
could be driven from his position. Yet though he has fortified himself by many
defences, and thinks that he is at a great distance from all danger, still he
shall be deprived of his office, and Eliakim shall be placed in his
room.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In a sure
place.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When he calls it "a sure place," this
must be understood with respect to men; for men judge that what is defended on
all sides will be of long duration; but God casts it down with the smallest
breath. It was only by way of concession that he called it "a sure place." Hence
it ought to be inferred how foolishly men boast, and rely on their greatness,
when they have been exalted to a high rank of honor; for in a very short time
they may be cast down and deprived of all
honor.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the burden that was
upon it shall be cut off.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When wicked men are
ruined, all who relied on their authority must also be ruined; and indeed it is
in the highest degree reasonable that they who were united by the same bond of
crimes, and who aided this wicked man as far as lay in their power, should share
in the same punishment. It is difficult for those who place themselves under the
protection of wicked men, and employ all their influence in behalf of them, not
to be also partakers of their crimes; and if they were guiltless of crime,
(which seldom, or rather, we may say, never happens,) still they are justly
punished on this ground, that they have placed their trust on them as a very
sure defense, and have depended wholly on their will and
authority.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The burden of
Tyre.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> <i>Tyre</i> was very wealthy, and highly
celebrated, both on account of the variety and extent of its commercial
intercourse with all nations, and on account of the flourishing colonies which
sprang from it: Carthage, which was the rival of the Roman Empire, Utica,
Leptis, Cadiz, and other towns, which also sent every year a present to Tyre, by
which they acknowledged that they looked on Tyre as their mother. Isaiah
threatens its destruction, because it had been hostile to the people of God, as
we may infer from what is said by Ezekiel; for we ought carefully to attend to
the cause of the destruction, because it was the design of the Prophet to shew
that God testifies his fatherly regard to his people by opposing all her
enemies.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;262602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
26:2.) Some think that this refers to the storming of Tyre by Alexander, who
took it with great difficulty. But the argument on which they rely, that Isaiah
mentions <i>Chittim</i>,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F358</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> has little force. By that name the
Hebrew writers unquestionably denote the Macedonians, but under this word they
likewise include other nations, such as the Greeks, and the countries that were
beyond the sea. Nebuchadnezzar employed in that siege not only his own soldiers,
but also foreigners, whom he brought from Greece and other places. It is for a
reason altogether different, as we shall immediately see, that he mentions the
Greeks, namely, that henceforth they will not take their ships to Tyre for the
sake of carrying on merchandise.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But from the
conclusion of this chapter I draw an argument for a contrary opinion, for Isaiah
speaks of the restoration of Tyre, and it was never restored after having been
stormed by Alexander. Besides, when I compare Ezekiel's words with those of
Isaiah, I think that I see one and the same prediction. Now, he does not speak
of Alexander, but of Nebuchadnezzar; and I cannot doubt that it must be
explained in that manner. Not only so, but in the days of Ezekiel and Isaiah
that city was under the dominion of a king, but historians relate that, when it
was stormed by Alexander, it had been brought to the form of a republic. And if
we consider the object of the prophecy, we shall be sufficiently confirmed in
this opinion, for his aim is to comfort the Jews by threatening that the
inhabitants of Tyre, by whom they had been oppressed, will not pass unpunished.
For it would have been highly inconsistent that the Lord should punish other
nations, and that this nation, which had been not less hostile, should escape
punishment altogether, or be punished five hundred years afterwards. Every
conjecture, therefore, leads us to this conclusion, that we should expound this
passage as relating to
Nebuchadnezzar.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Howl, ye ships
of Tarshish.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He employs various figures of
speech, according to his custom, in illustrating the ruin of Tyre, in order to
obtain greater credit to the prediction; for a plain narrative would have been
ineffectual, or would not have exerted a powerful influence on minds naturally
dull and sluggish, and therefore he sets before their eyes a lively portrait.
This calamity, he declares, will be very grievous, because it will be felt even
in distant countries. He bids the "ships howl," because, when Tyre has been
destroyed, they will have nothing to do. The ships of the Cilicians are
particularly mentioned by him, because, being neighbors, they traded often and
extensively with the inhabitants of Tyre; and Cilicia is called by the Hebrews
"Tarshish." It was impossible that there should not have arisen great
inconvenience to that country at the destruction of Tyre; not only because
commerce ceased for a time, but also because the articles of merchandise were
carried off, and there was a disturbance of commercial relations
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F359</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as usually happens when the fortunes of rich men have been
overthrown.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That there may be
no entering in from the land of Chittim.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What I
have translated "that there maybe no entering in," is explained by some to
signify, that there may be no house "into which you can enter," but I think that
I have faithfully conveyed the Prophet's meaning. And yet he does not mean that
the Cilicians or the Greeks will be hindered from entering, but that they will
not hold intercourse with Tyre as they were formerly accustomed to do, because
it will not be, as formerly, a mart of
nations.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Those who think that the Prophet speaks
of the defeat accomplished by Alexander, separate this clause of the verse "from
the land of Chittim" from what goes before, and connect it thus, "from the land
of Chittim it was revealed to them." But, on the contrary, I join it differently
in this way, "From not going from the land of Chittim; " that is that the Greeks
may no more enter as they were formerly accustomed to do. By the word "Chittim,"
he means both the Greeks and the western nations; as if he had said "There will
be an end put to commerce with the Greeks so that they will no longer take their
ships thither." Under this designation he includes also the inhabitants of
Cyprus,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F360</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Sicily, and Italy, and other
nations.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This was revealed to
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> These words may be understood to refer
both to the Greeks and to the inhabitants of Tyre. If they refer to the
inhabitants of Tyre, the meaning will be, "When the report of the ruin of the
city shall reach them, they will put an end to their wonted voyages, for they
will avoid that harbour as they would avoid a rock;" and this is the meaning
which I more readily adopt. Yet I do not reject the other interpretation, that
the Prophet confirms his prediction, as we commonly speak of a thing that is
certain, "Let this be regarded as addressed to
you."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be silent, ye inhabitants of the
islands.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is intended to place in a more
striking light the ruin of Tyre. There is a change of number in the word
<i>island;</i> for although he uses the singular number, yet he means the
islands of the Mediterranean sea, and the countries beyond the sea, especially
the neighbors who frequently performed voyages to Tyre, and traded with it. He
enjoins on them silence and stillness, because they will perform no more voyages
to Tyre. He bids them "be silent" like persons who are stunned, on account of
the grievous calamity which has befallen them, so that they do not even venture
to open their mouth; for it was impossible that the nations who traded there
should not feel it to be a heavy stroke, when a mercantile city like this was
ruined, just as at the present day Venice or Antwerp could not be destroyed
without inflicting great injury on many
nations.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The merchants of
Sidon.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He mentions the inhabitants of
<i>Sidon</i> in an especial manner, not only on account of their vicinity, but
because they had a common origin. <i>Sidon</i> was highly celebrated, but
greatly inferior to Tyre. Situated on the sea-shore, it was two hundred furlongs
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F361</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
distant from Tyre, and appeared both to be so near it, and to be so closely
connected with it by trade, that the poets frequently took Tyre for Sidon, and
Sidon for Tyre. The Sidonians, therefore, were unquestionably greater gainers
than others by imports and exports, and also by sales and merchandise, in
consequence of being so near, and trading with it continually; for the wealth of
Tyre overflowed on them, and, as the saying is, they flew under its wings. The
result was, that they suffered more severely than others by the destruction of
Tyre, and therefore the Prophet afterwards says, (verse 4,)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be ashamed, O
Sidon.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who replenished
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He adds this general expression, either
because it was filled with crowds and multitudes of men, when strangers flocked
to it from various and distant countries, or because they who performed voyages
to it for the sake of gain did, in their turn, enrich the
city.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And by great waters.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He intimates that the
riches of Tyre will not prevent it from being destroyed; and therefore he extols
its wealth, in order that the judgment of God may be more manifest, and that all
may know that it was no ordinary calamity that befel it; and the more unexpected
it was, the more evidently would it appear to be the work of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The seed of the Nile.
</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F362</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
By an elegant expression he describes the wealth of Tyre; for since the Nile
supplied it with wheat and other necessaries of life, and since a great quantity
of corn was brought to it out of Egypt, he says that it had fields and
<i>sowing</i> on the course of the Nile, just as the inhabitants of Venice say
that their harvest is on the sea, because they have nothing that grows at home,
but all that is necessary for food is brought to them by commerce. The Prophet
speaks of the inhabitants of Tyre in the same manner; for it might be thought
incredible that they whom the Nile so freely and abundantly supplied should be
in want of food. He shews that this will be a vain boast, because they will be
in want of all things; and these things, as we have already said, are described
by Isaiah, that all may more fully acknowledge the avenging hand of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Be thou ashamed, O Sidon; for the sea hath
spoken.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This verse is added for the purpose of
heightening the picture. We have explained the reason why he speaks particularly
of Sidon. He calls Tyre, by way of eminence,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kat j
ejxoch&lt;n</font><font face="Palatino">,) <i>the sea</i>, as if she reigned
alone in the midst of the
sea.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have not
travailed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> These words are immediately added,
and belong
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">mimhtikw~v</font><font face="Palatino">)
to a fictitious address put into the mouth of Tyre, in which the Prophet wittily
taunts the inhabitants of Tyre, who boasted of her colonies; for she "brought
forth" other illustrious cities. "In ancient times," says Pliny, "she was famous
for the cities which she built, Leptis, Utica, and that rival of the Roman
empire, Carthage, which aspired to govern the whole world, besides Cadiz, which
was built beyond the limits of the world. Her whole superiority now consists of
scarlet and purple." (Plin. Hist. Nat., lib. 5:c. 19.) Thus, Isaiah represents
Tyre as bewailing her ancient glory, because she has ceased to be a mother, and
because it is of no avail to her that she has brought forth so many children,
and founded so many cities; for at an early period Carthage sent regularly every
year a present to Tyre, for the purpose of doing homage to her as the mother. In
this manner Tyre appeared to hold a higher rank than all other cities, since
even Carthage, though a rival of the Roman empire, was in some respect subject
to Tyre: but the Lord stripped her of all her ornaments in a moment, so that she
bewailed her bereavement, as if she had never brought up any
children.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As soon as the report shall reach
the Egyptians.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F363</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In this verse he declares that this
destruction will affect equally the inhabitants of Tyre and those of Egypt; and
this confirms the exposition which we follow, that the present prophecy relates
to a former devastation. The inhabitants of Tyre had been in alliance with the
Egyptians, and both countries had been under kingly government; not as in
Alexander's time, when Tyre was a free state, and lived under its own laws. The
alliance which existed between the inhabitants of Tyre and those of Egypt could
not have been more appropriately described; and therefore he shews that this
ruin extends also to the Egyptians, because they prompted the Jews to rebellion,
and turned them aside from confidence in God. The former were open enemies; the
latter, under the pretense of friendship, cherished dangerous hostility; and
therefore both are justly punished.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pass ye over to
Tarshish.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He addresses not only the inhabitants
of Tyre, but foreigners who were connected with them by trading and bids them go
elsewhere and seek new harbours: and he mentions Cilicia, which was opposite to
Tyre, as if he had said, "That shore, which was wont to be well supplied with
harbours, will henceforth be forsaken, so that ships will sail in a very
different direction;" for when a harbour or a mercantile city has been ruined,
merchants commonly go in search of
another.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Howl, ye inhabitants
of the island.
</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F364</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
"Island," as we have formerly explained, is here put for "islands;" for the
change of number is very customary with Hebrew writers. He foretells that they
will lament, because their support depended entirely on that traffic, and
because their accounts and reckonings
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F365</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
were scattered about in all
directions.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is this your exulting
city?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet mocks at Tyre, and ridicules
her pride, because she boasted of the antiquity of her name. He likewise
confirms what all would suppose to be incredible; for this prediction was
undoubtedly laughed at, seeing, that the power of Tyre was unshaken, and her
wealth was like a wall of brass. So much the more confidently does Isaiah speak,
and threaten that her ruin is certain, and that, though she be more ancient than
other cities, and though she be universally applauded on that ground, still this
will not prevent her from being destroyed. The origin of Tyre is traced in
profane history from time almost out of mind, and is so obscure and intricate,
that hardly anything can be ascertained; though they allege that it was founded
by the Phenicians, as those who boast of the fame of antiquity call themselves
natives of the soil. With this antiquity the Prophet contrasts banishment,
intimating that, when God had determined to inflict punishment on that nation,
her stability would be at an
end.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Her feet shall carry her,
to travel into a distant country.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To follow
wherever "the feet carry," is nothing else than to have long wanderings. Yet he
also means that they will be deprived of their wealth, and will be in want of
all things during their banishment, so that they will not have a conveyance of
any kind, or a beast to carry them. Banishment is a very hard condition, when
poverty is added to it; for it may be more easily endured where there are the
means of supporting life; but when men must dwell in unknown countries in the
deepest poverty, the misery is extreme. He adds the finishing stroke to their
miseries by saying, that they must "travel into a distant country;" for the
greater the distance, the harder is the
banishment.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Against crowning
Tyre.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He adorns with this title the city which
enriched many, as may be easily learned from the context; for when he calls her
merchants "kings," he plainly states that by the word <i>crown</i> he intended
to express metaphorically the magnificence of kings. This refutes the opinion of
those who refer it to other cities. The general meaning is, that she enriches
her citizens as if she made them kings and
princes.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Some think that the Prophet added this
verse, as if he were assuming the character of one who is astonished at the
destruction of Tyre, in order to strike others with amazement; as if he had
said, "Is it possible that Tyre should be so speedily overthrown, where riches,
and troops, and defences, and fortifications, are so abundant, and where there
is so much pomp and magnificence?" and as if he suddenly stopped, as we are wont
to do, when anything unexpected has occurred. But it is better to connect it
with the following verse, which removes every difficulty; for in that verse the
Prophet himself immediately answers his own question, by which he intended to
arouse the minds of his hearers to closer attention. He might have simply said,
that these things were done by the purpose of the Lord; but we are sluggish, and
stupid men would have treated them with contempt. By this question, therefore,
he arouses their minds, that all may know that he is not speaking about an
ordinary event, and that they may consider it more carefully; for the farther
the judgments of God are removed from the ordinary opinions of men, so much the
more ought they to excite our astonishment.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He
formerly spoke in the same manner about Egypt, when he intended to shew that the
destruction of it could not be reckoned one of the ordinary changes.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;231901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
19:1-25.) Since therefore it was incredible that Tyre could be overthrown by
man, the Prophet justly infers that God is the author of its ruin. On this
account he calls her the mother or nurse of kings, that he may place in a more
striking light the glory of the divine judgment; for if it had been any ordinary
state, its fall would have been viewed with contempt; but when it was adorned
with the highest rank, who would think that this happened in any other way than
by the purpose of God?</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whose
merchants are princes.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F366</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In like manner the merchants of Venice
in the present day think that they are on a level with princes, and that they
are above all other men except kings; and even the factors look on men of rank
as beneath them. I have been told, too, that at Antwerp there are factors who do
not hesitate to lay out expenses which the wealthiest of the nobility could not
support. We are wont to put questions, when no reply can be given but what we
wish; and this is an indication of
boldness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To profane the pride, or, to
profane the loftiness;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> for it may be read
either way, because loftiness leads to pride, and where loftiness or a high
spirit is found, there seldom is humility. But it will be better to read it
<i>Pride</i>, which alone provokes the vengeance of God, when men, under
pretense of their excellence, vaunt themselves above measure. To "profane" and
to "despise" mean the same thing; for those who are high in rank imagine that
they are separated from others, and consider themselves to have something
indescribably lofty belonging to them, as if they ought not to mingle with the
crowd of human beings. But God strips them of their rank, degrades them, and
treats them as vile and worthless.</font><br><font face="Palatino">From this
passage let us learn, that we ought to contemplate the providence of God in such
a manner as to ascribe to his almighty power the praise which it deserves for
righteous government. Although the rectitude by which God regulates his
judgments is not always apparent or made visible to us, still it is never lawful
to separate his wisdom and justice from his power. But as the Scriptures very
frequently state and clearly explain the reason why God does this or that, we
ought carefully to examine the cause of his
works.</font><br><font face="Palatino">That invention which the Schoolmen have
introduced, about the absolute power of God, is shocking blasphemy. It is all
one as if they said that God is a tyrant who resolves to do what he pleases, not
by justice, but through caprice. Their schools are full of such blasphemies, and
are not unlike the heathens, who said that God sports with human affairs. But in
the school of Christ we are taught that the justice of God shines brightly in
his works, of whatever kind they are, "that every mouth may be stopped,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450319&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:19,) and that glory may be ascribed to him
alone.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet therefore assigns the causes
of so great an overthrow, that we may not think that God acts without a reason;
for the inhabitants of Tyre were proud, ambitious, lewd, and licentious. These
vices follow in the train of wealth and abundance, and commonly abound in
mercantile cities. For this reason he shews that God is provoked on account of
these vices, that all who are left may be taught by this example to pay greater
attention to their own interests, and not to abuse the gifts of God for parade
and luxury. Such is the benefit which we ought to draw from it, for we must not
imagine that it is a bare history which is related to
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But a question arises, Does God hate the
exalted rank of princes and lords? For he raises on high princes, senators,
nobles, and all classes of magistrates and rulers; and how then can he hate
them? I reply, the high station occupied by princes is not in itself hateful to
God, but only on account of the vice which is accidental to it, that when they
have been highly exalted, they despise others, and do not think that they are
men. Thus, pride is almost always an attendant of high station, and therefore
God hates it; and, in a word, he must rebuke that haughtiness of which he
declares that he is an enemy.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.

now overturn Tyre, however flourishing and wealthy it may be. And indeed this
manner of speaking is frequently employed in Scripture, if it be not made plain
by manifest examples and by actual demonstration. It is therefore believed that
the Prophet here calls to remembrance the deliverance from Egypt, when the Lord
divided the sea,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021421&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
14:21,22,) and again, when he drove out seven kings, and brought his people into
the land of Canaan.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;060601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joshua
6:1-27; 8:1-35; 10:1-43). But when I take a closer view of the words of the
Prophet, I am more disposed to explain them as referring to the present state of
matters; for he speaks here of Tyre, whose riches covered the whole
sea.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He shook the
kingdoms.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What he says about the
<i>kingdoms</i> is, because she could not perish alone, but must at the same
time involve many kingdoms in her ruin. Thus the whole world must have undergone
some change, as appears from history; and finally, the Prophet himself draws the
conclusion, that the Lord commanded that this mart of nations should be
overthrown.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah hath given
commandment concerning Canaan.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

(<i>chenaan</i>) has led commentators to think that the Prophet here speaks of
the Canaanites, and refers to the proof which God gave of his vengeance against
them. But there is little force in that argument; for!
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;[nk</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>chenaan</i>) is often taken for a common noun, just as, a little before,
(verse 8,) he used the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hyn[nk</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>chinyaneiha</i>) to mean <i>her factors</i>. The riches of Tyre having
consisted of merchandise and trading, Isaiah described it by naming the
principal part. By the expression, <i>hath given commandment</i>, he extols the
providence of God, that the Jews may know that all that appears to be permanent
in the world stands and falls according to the will of God, and that there is no
need of the instruments of war for overturning the best fortified place, but the
mere expression of the will of God is
enough.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b><i>

add any more to rejoice.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F369</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>All this belongs to one and the
same object; for, since a plain description would not have had sufficient
weight, the Prophet confirms his prediction by many words. It was incredible
that a city so celebrated and powerful, so well defended and fortified, and
associated with many allies and confederates, should be destroyed and
overturned. When he says, Thou shalt not add, he does not intend to shut out the
hope of restoration which he will give soon afterwards; for this threatening
ought to be limited to the time of the ruin of Tyre, "Thou shalt not live
wantonly, as formerly thou wert wont to
do."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O
virgin.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Metaphorically he calls her
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a
virgin</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because, previous to that time, the
riches of Tyre were untouched, and had suffered no injury. This is not praise of
chastity, but a witty manner of saying that the treasures which had been laid up
in faithful custody will be violated. "Formerly thou didst skip lightly, like
heifers in the bloom of youth but when thou hast suffered violence, there will
be an end of thy mirth; " just as if one should say, that the city of Venice has
not lost her virginity because it has not been taken by force since it was
built.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Daughter of
Sidon.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He continues to speak of Tyre, but gives
it this name, because it was built by the Sidonians, though the daughter
excelled the mother, as frequently happens in human affairs. The convenience and
situation of the place gave a superiority to the inhabitants of Tyre, and Sidon
became but an appendage. From the book of Kings it is evident enough
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;110501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 5:1) that the monarchy of Tyre had a high reputation, but here the Prophet
looked at its origin.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pass
over to Chittim.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When he bids them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pass over to
Chittim</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he banishes them not only into
Cilicia, but into countries still more distant; for under this name he includes
Greece, Italy, and other countries; as if he had said, "When thou shalt change
thy residence on account of banishment, thou shalt have no settled habitation in
neighboring countries; but thou must wander through the whole world, shalt be
dragged into unknown countries, and even there thou shalt find no rest." Lastly,
he means that the ruin will be so lamentable, that they will not have among
neighbors, and, after crossing the sea, they will not have among foreigners, a
place of rest.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, the land of the
Chaldeans. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He now confirms by an example what
he predicted about the taking of Tyre; for those things could scarcely obtain
credit, especially among the inhabitants of Tyre, who thought that they were
very far from such ruin. I am aware that this passage is explained in various
ways, but I shall not spend time in refuting the opinions of others. It will be
enough if I shall state, as far as I am able to form a judgment of it, the
Prophet's real meaning.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
people of the Chaldeans was not;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, they
had no name; for, if we inquire into their origin, they were descended from the
Assyrians, as is evident from
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011011&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
10:11. He therefore says truly, that they were not at first a nation, but were
concealed under the name of another, so that they did not form a separate
body.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ashur founded it for the
inhabitants of the wilderness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The words which
we have rendered "inhabitants of the wilderness" others translate <i>ships</i>,
but we do not approve of that exposition. What we at first stated is preferable,
namely, that the Assyrians gave a settled condition to the Chaldeans, who
formerly led a wandering life in the deserts under
skins,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F370</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but were collected into cities, and
trained to higher civilization, by the Assyrians. This is also the meaning of
the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wrrw[</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>gnoreru</i>,) namely, that they erected and built cities; for we cannot
agree with those who render it "to destroy."
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F371</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
What happened?</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He brought it
to ruin.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> That is, to use a common expression,
"The daughter has devoured the mother;" for the Assyrian monarchy was overturned
by the Chaldeans, though it was more powerful and flourishing than all the
others. It will be said, what has this to do with Tyre? We answer, it is because
Tyre will be overthrown by the Assyrians and Chaldeans. Since therefore the
Chaldeans, who formerly were no people, could conquer the Assyrians and subject
them to their power, why should we wonder if both united should conquer Tyre?
since the Lord gave such a display of his power in the case of the Assyrians,
why should Tyre rely on her riches? She will undoubtedly be made to feel the
hand of God, and her power will be of no avail to
her.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>Howl, ye ships of Tarshish.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He
repeats what he formerly said; for the Cilicians, on account of their vicinity,
constantly traded with the inhabitants of Tyre. He bids their ships <i>howl</i>,
because, when that harbour is shut up, the merchants will be struck with
amazement at not having their ordinary intercourse. He calls that harbour which
they visited, <i>their strength</i>, not only because it was a place of resort
that might be relied on, but because there was no other way in which their
voyages could yield profit.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall come to pass in that
day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> After having spoken of the taking of Tyre,
he next declares how long her calamity shall endure. It happens that cities
which have been ruined are suddenly restored, and regain their former position;
but the Prophet testifies that this city will be desolate and ruinous for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seventy
years</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>being
forgotten</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he means that there will be no
merchandise, because she will not have the ordinary course of
trade.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to the days
of one king.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F372</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some think that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the days of one
king</i></font><font face="Palatino"> relate to David, but that is exceedingly
frivolous, for "the days of a king" are put for the age of a man, in the same
manner as the age of a man is shewn by the Psalmist to be generally limited to
seventy years.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;199010&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
90:10.) But why did he mention "a king" rather than any other man? It was
because Tyre had a king, and reckoned time by the life of a king. This
contributed greatly to establish the certainty of the prediction, for the
Prophet could not have ascertained it by human
conjectures.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Tyre shall have a
song like that of a harlot.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By "the song of a
harlot" he employs a beautiful comparison to denote merchandise; not that in
itself it ought to be condemned, for it is useful and necessary to a
commonwealth, but he alludes to the fraud and dishonesty with which it
frequently abounds, so that it may justly be compared to the occupation of a
harlot.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take a
harp.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He compares Tyre to a harlot, who, after
having spent the whole period of her youth in debauchery, has at length grown
old, and on that account is forsaken and despised by all, and yet cannot forget
her former gain and lewdness, but desires to grow young again and renew her
loves, and, in order to attract men, goes about the city, delighting their ears
by songs and musical instruments. Such prostitutes are seized with some kind of
madness, when they perceive that they are disregarded on account of their old
age; and we see that Horace mocks at Lydia on this
account.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F373</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Thus Tyre, after having been ruined, and
as it were buried in oblivion, will again put forth her efforts, and schemes,
and contrivances, for recovering her former
condition.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Make sweet
melody.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By the "harp" and "sweet melody," he
means the tricks, and frauds, and blandishments, and flatteries of merchants, by
which they impose on men, and as it were drive them into their nets. In a word,
he shews by what methods mercantile cities become rich, that is, by deceitful
and unlawful methods; and therefore he says, that Tyre will regale their ears by
pleasant melody.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sing many
songs.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> That is, Tyre will add fraud to fraud,
and allurements to allurements, that at length she may attract all to her, may
be again remembered by men, and recover her former celebrity. In short, as an
old harlot contrives methods for regaining the favor of men, and allures them by
painting, and ornaments, and dress, and songs, and musical instruments, so will
Tyre recover her wealth and power by the same arts with which she formerly
succeeded. And yet he does not on that account exhort Tyre to restore herself in
this way, but proceeds with his
prophecy.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah will visit
Tyre.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F374</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Although the Lord will afflict Tyre in
such a manner that she will appear to be ruined, yet he declares that she will
obtain mercy, because, rising at length out, of her ruins, she will be restored
to her former vigor. Such a restoration is justly ascribed to the favor of God;
for otherwise the same thing must have happened to them as Malachi foretells
would happen to the Edomites, that the Lord would overturn and destroy all that
men would build.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;390104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
1:4.) Consequently they would never have returned to their former condition if
the Lord had not aided them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">From these words we
ought to draw a profitable doctrine, that though the Lord is a severe judge
towards the wicked, yet he leaves room for the exercise of his compassion, and
is never so harsh as not to mitigate his chastisements, and at length to put an
end to them. And if he is such towards the wicked, what will he be towards those
whom he has adopted, and on whom he determines to pour out his goodness? When
kingdoms therefore are re-established, when cities are rebuilt, and nations
regain their freedom, this is brought about solely by the providence of God,
who, whenever he pleases, lays low what is high,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;090207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 2:7,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;420152&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
1:52,) and quickly raises up and restores what was
fallen.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And then she will
return to her hire.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This ought to be viewed as
a contrast to the former statement, for the meaning is, that Tyre will be no
better, and will not be reformed by so severe a chastisement, because she will
quickly return to her natural disposition; for he accuses her of ingratitude. We
see instances of the same kind every day. There is scarcely a corner of the
world in which the Lord has not exhibited proofs of his judgment. To those whom
he has chastised he allows time to breathe, but they become no better. Isaiah
says that this will happen to
Tyre.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>She will commit
fornication.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> "She will not repent, but, on the
contrary, will return to her former courses.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>She will commit
fornication</i></font><font face="Palatino">, as she was formerly accustomed to
do." He unquestionably speaks of buying and selling, but continues to employ the
comparison which he had adopted; not that he wishes to condemn the occupation of
a merchant, as we have already said, but that it is so largely mingled with the
corruption of men as to resemble closely the life of a harlot; for it is so full
of tricks, and hidden stratagems, and deep-laid traps, (as we often see,) that
it appears to have been contrived for the purpose of ensnaring and deceiving
men. How many new and unheard of contrivances for making gain and exacting usury
are every day invented, which no one who has not been long trained in the school
of merchandise can understand? We need not wonder, therefore, that the Prophet
made use of this comparison, for it means that Tyre will have no more honesty
than before in mercantile transactions.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But her merchandise and her
hire shall be holiness to the Lord. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This was
another instance of the divine compassion towards Tyre. Though she had been
restored, yet she was not converted to God, but continued to follow dishonest
practices, so that she justly deserved to be ruined. And indeed she was again
punished severely, when Alexander took the city by storm; but still the kingdom
of Christ, as Luke informs us, was erected there.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;442104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
21:4.) This verse ought therefore to be viewed as contrasted with the former, as
if he had said, "<i>And yet</i> the merchandise of Tyre shall be consecrated to
God." Here we have an astonishing proof of the goodness of God, which penetrated
not only into this abominable brothel, but almost into hell itself. The
restoration of Tyre ought thus to be regarded as a proof of the goodness of God;
but the former favor was small in comparison with the second, when God
consecrated her to himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But a question
arises, "Could that which the inhabitants of Tyre obtained by cheating and
unlawful methods be offered to God in sacrifice?" For God abhors such
sacrifices, and demands an honest and pure conscience.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;202127&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
21:27,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:13.) Many commentators, in expounding this passage, give themselves much
uneasiness about this question, but without any good reason; for the Prophet
does not mean that the merchandise of Tyre will be consecrated to God while she
continues to commit fornication, but describes a time subsequent to her change
and conversion. At that time she will not lay up riches for herself, will not
amass them by unlawful methods, but will employ them in the service of God, and
will spend the produce of her merchandise in relieving the wants of the godly.
When he used a word expressive of what was disgraceful, he had his eye on the
past, but intimated that she would unlearn those wicked practices, and change
her disposition.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It shall not
be treasured nor laid up.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He describes, in a
few words, the repentance of Tyre, who, having formerly been addicted to
avarice, has been converted to Christ, and will no longer labor to amass riches,
but will employ them in kind and generous actions; and this is the true fruit of
repentance, as Paul admonishes, that "he who stole should steal no more, but, on
the contrary, should labor that he might relieve the poor and needy."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490428&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:28.) Isaiah foretells that the inhabitants of Tyre, who formerly, through
insatiable avarice, devoured the riches of all, will henceforth take pleasure in
generous actions, because they will no longer have an insatiable desire of gain.
It is an evidence of brotherly love when we relieve our neighbors, as it is an
evidence of cruelty if we suffer them to be hungry, especially when we ourselves
have abundance.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Her
merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He next mentions a proper method of
exercising generosity, which is, to employ their wealth in aiding the servants
of God. Though he includes all godly persons, yet he alludes to the Levites and
priests, some of whom sacrificed, while others made ready the sacrifices, and
others kept watch, and, in short, all were ready to perform their duty; and
therefore they were said to "dwell before the Lord."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;040301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
3:1-4:49.) The same thing may justly be said of all the ministers of the Church.
But as all believers, of whatever rank they are, belong to the sanctuary of God,
and have been made by Christ "a royal priesthood,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 2:9;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;660106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Revelation
1:6,) that they may stand in the presence of God so I willingly regard this
passage as relating to all "the household of faith,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
6:10,) to whom attention is especially due; for Paul holds them out as having
the highest claims, and enjoins that they shall be first relieved. If the tie
which binds us universally to mankind ought to prevent us from "despising our
own flesh,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235807&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
58:7,) how much more the tie that binds the members of Christ, which is closer
and more sacred than any natural bonds?</font><br><font face="Palatino">We ought
also to attend to this mode of expression, by which we are said to "dwell before
God;"
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F375</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for though there is not now any "Ark of the Covenant,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580904&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
9:4,) yet, through the kindness of Christ, we approach more nearly to God than
the Levites formerly did. We are therefore enjoined to "walk before him," as if
we were under his eye, that we may follow holiness and justice with a pure
conscience. We are enjoined to walk before him, and always to consider him as
present, that we may be just and
upright.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they may eat
till they are satisfied.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F376</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The Prophet means that we ought to supply the wants of brethren with greater
abundance and generosity than what is customary among men; for when neighbors
ought to be relieved, men are very niggardly. Few men perform cheerfully any
gratuitous duty, or labor, or kindness; for they reckon that they give up and
take from their own property all that they bestow on others. For the purpose of
correcting this error, God highly commends cheerfulness; for the command which
Paul gives to deacons, "to distribute joyfully,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
12:8,) ought to be applied to all; and all ought to remember that passage which
declares that "God loveth a cheerful giver."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470907&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 9:7.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">It deserves our attention,
also, that the Prophet says that what is bestowed on the poor is consecrated to
God; as the Spirit elsewhere teaches, that "with such sacrifices God is well
pleased."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
13:16;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470912&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 9:12.) Never was it on his own account that he commanded sacrifices
to be made, nor did he ever stand in need of them. But under the law he ordained
such exercises of piety; and he now commands us to bestow and spend on our
neighbors something that is our own, and declares that all that we lay out on
their account</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F377</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is "a sacrifice of sweet savor,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;500418&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
4:18,) and is approved and accepted by him. This ought powerfully to inflame us
to the exercise of kindness and generosity, when we learn that our alms are so
highly applauded, and that our hands, as well as our gift, are consecrated to
God.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, Jehovah maketh the earth
empty.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This prophecy, so far as I can judge, is
the conclusion of all the descriptions that have been given from the thirteenth
chapter downwards, in which Isaiah foretold destruction not only to the Jews and
to Israel, but to the Moabites, Assyrians, Egyptians, and other nations. In
short, having, as it were, surveyed all the countries which were near the Jews
and known to them, he gives a brief summary of the whole. Some view this as
referring to Israel, and others to the Jews, and think that their destruction is
foretold; but as he mentions <i>the world</i>, I can view it in no other light
than as a comprehensive statement of all that he formerly said about each of
them, and at different times. Nor is this view contradicted by the fact that he
immediately mentions <i>the priest</i>, which might lead us to believe that
these things relate to none but the people of God; for although he speaks of all
the nations, yet because the Jews always hold the highest rank, Isaiah must have
had them especially in his eye, for he was appointed to them. It may be said to
have been accidental that he mentions other nations; and therefore we ought not
to wonder if, after having made reference to them, he speaks particularly about
his own people in a single word.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Others suppose
that he means "the whole world," but think that he refers to the last day, which
I consider to be an excessively forced interpretation; for, after having
threatened the Jews and other nations, the Prophet afterwards adds a
consolation, that the Lord will one day raise up his Church and make her more
flourishing; which certainly cannot apply to the last judgment. But by the term
<i>the earth</i>, I do not think that the Prophet means the whole world, but the
countries well known to the Jews; just as in the present day, when we speak of
what happens in the world, we almost never go beyond Europe, or think of what is
passing in India; for this may be said to be our word. Thus, Isaiah speaks of
"the earth" known to himself and to all whom he addressed, and of the people who
inhabited the neighboring countries. In short, we may limit the term "World" to
the Egyptians, Assyrians, Moabites, Tyrians, and such like; as if he had said,
"Hitherto I have spoken of various calamities, which threatened many nations;
and still in part threaten some of them; but I may sum up all by saying, 'The
Lord will overturn and strip the face of the earth of all its
ornaments.'"</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And maketh it
bare.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F378</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some translate
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hqlb</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>bolekach</i>,) <i>he uncovereth the earth</i> that the enemies may have free
entrance into it. But I choose rather to translate it, "he maketh bare the
earth," because the earth is said to be "covered," when it is inhabited by a
great multitude of men, and when it abounds in fruits and flocks; and it is said
to be "uncovered" or "laid bare," when it is deprived of its inhabitants, and
when its covering is taken away from it, as if one were stripped of his raiment
and ornaments. Now, this must have happened not only to the Jews, but to the
Assyrians, Egyptians, and other nations, which he had mentioned; and therefore
to all of them together he threatens their
ruin.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall
be.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By these words he means the utmost
desolation, in which there will be no longer any distinction of ranks or any
appearance of a commonwealth; for so long as there is a tolerably regular form
of government, some distinction continues to be maintained between "the people"
and "the priests." By a figure of speech, in which a part is taken for the
whole,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sunekdocikw~v</font><font face="Palatino">,)
he mentions one department instead of the whole class, as is frequently done in
the Scriptures; though we might take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ynjk</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>kochanim</i>,) to mean those who hold any high rank; for Hebrew writers
frequently give this name to princes, and especially to those who are of royal
blood; but I have no reluctance to view it as an instance of the figure of
speech which I have mentioned.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Since Isaiah
reckons this confusion among the curses of God, and declares that, when the
distinction of ranks is laid aside, it is a terrible display of the vengeance of
God, we ought to conclude, on the other hand, how much God is pleased with
regular government and the good order of society, and also how great a privilege
it is to have it preserved among us; for when it is taken away, the life of man
differs little from the sustenance of cattle and of beasts of prey. We ought
therefore not only to acknowledge the dreadful vengeance of God, but also to lay
it to the blame of our own sins, whenever he breaks down order and takes away
instruction and courts of law; for when these fall, civilisation itself falls
along with them. It ought also to be considered that, when the Lord executes his
judgments, he spares no rank, not even the most sacred. What was this order of
priests, which the Lord had so splendidly adorned, and had determined to
consecrate to himself, and of which the people also boasted as if it had been
unchangeable and eternal? Yet even the rank of priesthood is involved in the
judgment of God, because there is no respect of persons, but, on the contrary,
the more highly any have been favored, and the higher the rank to which they
have been exalted, the more severely will he punish them, if they shall shew
themselves to be ungrateful and abuse his
benefits.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As the servant, so
his master; as the buyer, so the seller.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This
statement is to the same effect with what goes before; for these ranks are
manifestly lawful, and are not usually set aside, unless when the Lord
determines to chastise his people with dreadful vengeance, as we have already
said; for in a well-ordered society the distinction between master and servant
must be observed. In like manner, no public government can be lasting without
the transactions of commerce; and therefore, when the distinction between rich
and poor has been taken away, every scheme for gaining a livelihood among men is
destroyed. The meaning of the Prophet is, that all civil government will be
broken up, because in such calamities, they who were the wealthiest are reduced
to the lowest poverty. In short, he describes the most appalling desolation,
which will be followed by unwonted
change.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By emptying shall the earth be
emptied.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He confirms what he had already said,
and declares that those changes will not be accidental, but that they are the
work of God. In the first verse, he had expressly stated that God is making
preparations for emptying the earth: he now asserts that it will happen, and
adds the reason, that God hath purposed and determined to do
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The earth hath
lamented.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Isaiah proceeds with his subject; for
all this tends to explain the desolation of the whole world, that is, of the
world which was known to the Jews. According to his custom, he illustrates the
judgment of God more clearly by figures, which are fitted to produce an effect
on sluggish minds.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The lofty
people of the earth.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F379</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> By the "lofty ones" we must understand
those eminent persons who held a higher rank than others; for this is more
wonderful than if the common people had fallen. Yet if it be thought preferable
to explain it as relating peculiarly to the Jews, I have no objection; for
although the Assyrians and Egyptians excelled them in wealth and power, still
the Jews held the highest rank in this respect, that they had been adopted by
God. But I prefer the other exposition, which makes the meaning to be, that the
Lord would inflict punishment, not only on common people, but also on those who
surpassed others in rank and splendor.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>

Others render it "defiled" or "polluted," because
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&atilde;nk</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>chanaph</i>) means "to be wicked." Both renderings may be appropriate; but
the next verse appears to demand that we explain it to mean <i>false</i>; for he
appears to illustrate and exhibit it more fully immediately afterwards, when he
says that "the earth has been consumed by a
curse."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Under its
inhabitants.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Whether
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tht</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>tahath</i>) be translated
"</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Under its
inhabitants</i></font><font face="Palatino">," or, "<i>On account of</i> its
inhabitants," is of little importance. There is a kind of mutual bargain between
the land and the husbandmen, that it gives back with usury what it has received:
if it does not, it deceives those who cultivate it. But he assigns a reason,
imputing blame to them, that they render it barren by their wickedness. It is
owing to our fault that it does not nourish us or bring forth fruit, as God
appointed to be done by the regular order of nature; for he wished that it
should hold the place of a mother to us, to supply us with food; and if it
change its nature and order, or lose its fertility, we ought to attribute it to
our sins, since we ourselves have reversed the order which God had appointed;
otherwise the earth would never deceive us, but would perform her
duty.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because they have
transgressed the laws.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He immediately assigns
the reason why the earth is unfaithful, and deceives her inhabitants. It is
because those who refuse to honor God their Father and supporter, will justly be
deprived of food and nourishment. Here he peculiarly holds up to shame the
revolt of his nation, because it was baser and less excusable than all the
transgressions of those who had never been taught in the school of God. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrwt</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>torah</i>) is applied to "the Law," because it denotes instruction; but
here, in the plural number,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">trwt</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>toroth</i>,) it denotes all the instruction that is contained in the "Law."
But as the "Law" contains both commandments and promises, he adds two parts for
the purpose of
explanation.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have changed
the ordinance.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qj</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>chok</i>) means "an ordinance," and on that account some think that it
denotes ceremonies, and others that it denotes morals. We may render it
"commandments;" and I understand it to mean not only ceremonies, but everything
that belongs to the rule of a holy
life.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have broken the
everlasting covenant.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The third term employed
by him is, </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tyrb
</font><font face="Palatino">(<i>berith</i>,) by which he means a covenant and
contract. This word is limited to those "contracts" by which the Lord, who
adopted his people, promised that he would be their God.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021906&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
19:6; 29:45;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;032612&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
26:12.) He therefore charges them with ingratitude, because, when the Lord
revealed himself by all these methods, and gave proofs of his love, they were
disobedient and rebellious, "transgressed the laws," and "broke the holy
covenant."</font><br><font face="Palatino">But why does he address himself to
the Jews? Because he knew that he had been appointed to be their Prophet, that
he might especially give instructions to them. Hence we may infer what is the
rule of a holy life. It is contained in that law which we ought to follow if we
wish that God should approve of our life; if we turn aside from it, we must be
wicked and abandoned. We ought also to remark, that it is the will of God that
in his word we should consider not only his commandments and laws, but also his
covenant; for the chief part of the word consists of promises, by which he
adopts and receives us as his own people. Besides, the Prophet unquestionably
intended to use a variety of terms in order to express his meaning more
strongly; as if he had said, "There is nothing about us that is sound and pure;
everything is polluted and corrupted."</font><br><font face="Palatino">He calls
it "the covenant of eternity," or "the everlasting covenant," because it ought
to be perpetual and inviolable, and to be in force in every age. It was to be
transmitted, in uninterrupted succession, from father to son, that it might
never be effaced from the memory of man, but might be kept pure and entire. He
therefore represents in strong terms their treachery and wickedness, because
they dared to violate that covenant which God had made with them, and to
overthrow what the Lord intended to be firm and permanent. This was monstrous;
and therefore we ought not to wonder that the earth takes vengeance for this
wickedness, and refuses to give food to
men.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore hath the curse devoured
the earth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some render it
<i>perjury</i>,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F381</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hla</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>alah</i>) signifies also a "curse," I have no doubt that here he employs it
to denote a "curse," and alludes to those curses which Moses in the law
threatens against wicked men and transgressors of the law,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;032616&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
26:16;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;052815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy

first parent, so that it brought forth thorns and thistles instead of fruits.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010317&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
3:17, 18.) The Lord mitigated this curse, so that, although men were ungrateful
and unworthy, still it yielded them food. But when we do not cease to sin, and
when we add sin to sin, is it not in the highest degree just that the earth
should become barren and unfruitful, in order that we may more clearly perceive
this curse, and that it may make a deeper impression on our
senses?</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And its inhabitants
are made desolate.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I think that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>asham</i>) here means "to make desolate," rather than "to forsake;" and this
is apparent from the context, on which account I have translated it "are made
desolate." But perhaps it will be thought preferable to take the copulative
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>vau</i>) as signifying <i>because</i>, and then the meaning will be, "The
earth accursed by God is burnt up, <i>because</i> its inhabitants have acted
wickedly."
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F382</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore
the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men
left.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wrj</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>charu</i>) may be taken metaphorically, and I prefer this view of it, which
makes the meaning to be, that those whom the wrath of God has consumed are
burned up; because the destruction is compared to a conflagration. When he adds,
"that few will be left," we learn from it that this prediction cannot be
explained as relating to the last day of judgment, and that, on the contrary,
the Prophet foretells and confirms those desolation which threatened various
nations, and that he does so in order that the godly may fear, and may be led to
repentance, and may be prepared for enduring all
things.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The wine hath
failed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The same subject is continued, and the
Prophet threatens chiefly against the Jews the desolation of the land. He gives
a long description in order to affect them more deeply, and impress them with a
conviction of the judgment of God. Their luxury, intemperance, and feasting, are
rapidly surveyed, because amidst so great abundance they proudly disobeyed God.
Such ingratitude was not peculiar to the Jews or to that age, but it is
universally found that they who enjoy abundance rebel against God, and indulge
themselves too freely. On this account the Prophet censures them; as if he had
said, "Hitherto you have been plunged in luxuries and pleasures, but the Lord
will cause you to lead a very different kind of life." Isaiah speaks of the
future as if it had been present, in order to place it more clearly before their
eyes.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall not drink wine with a
song.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To drink wine is not in itself evil,
because God has appointed it for the use of man; but here the Prophet describes
the banquets of drunkards, which were full of licentiousness, songs, and
insolence. Again, because they abused their enjoyment of plenty, he threatens
them with want, which men almost bring upon themselves, when by their luxury
they turn to a bad use the goodness of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Strong drink shall be
bitter.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He adds, that if they drink wine, it
will be "bitter" to them, because sorrow commonly deprives men of a relish both
for what they eat and for what they drink. The meaning may be thus summed up,
"Though they have abundance of wine, yet they will be deprived of the use of it,
because they will feel such sorrow as shall take away all relish for it."
"Strong drink shall be <i>bitter</i>;" that is, you shall no longer enjoy those
pleasures and delights in which you have hitherto
indulged.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>The city of
</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F383</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
vanity is broken down.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I do not object to
viewing this as relating especially to the desolation of Jerusalem. Yet it may
be gathered from the context that it applies also to other cities; for shortly
afterwards he uses the plural number in summoning the nations to appear before
the same tribunal. But as the Prophet had his own countrymen chiefly in view, we
may properly consider it to denote Jerusalem, which he calls "the city of
vanity," either because there was no solid virtue in it, or because it was
destroyed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wht</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>tohu</i>) may refer either to the destruction itself, or to their crimes, by
which they provoked the wrath of God against them. If it be thought better to
refer it to their crimes, it will denote "the city of confusion," in which
nothing is regular or properly arranged; and I approve of this interpretation.
Yet it may refer to the punishment; for it declares, in my opinion, the cause of
the destruction, and gives up the city to ruin, because justice and good
government are banished from
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every house is shut
up.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is a proof of solitude, and the only
reason why it is added is, to express the desolation of that
city.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There is a cry about
wine.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He means, that there will be a scarcity
of wine; for where want or hunger is found, it is accompanied by unceasing
complaints, not only in private, but "in the streets" and public places. He
therefore points out those doleful sounds and complaints, but, at the same time,
reproves their luxury and intemperance, because they were not satisfied with
what was necessary, but greedily swallowed wine, and abandoned themselves to
every kind of enjoyment. We must supply the contrast. "Hitherto you have had
abundance of wine and of food, and you have taken occasion from it to grow
insolent against God; and therefore you will justly be deprived of them, and,
instead of your wanton indulgence, wailing and lamentations will be heard in the
streets."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All joy is
darkened.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The metaphor in this second clause
deserves attention; for, as we say that joy brightens when it obtains its
object, so the Prophet here says, that "joy is darkened," because sorrow may be
said to be a cloud drawn over it. To <i>rejoice</i> is not in itself evil, any
more than to drink; and the Prophet does not censure joy simply considered, but
excessive and immoderate mirth. When men are merry, they lay no restraint on
themselves on account of that dissoluteness or love of disorder
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajtaxi&gt;an</font><font face="Palatino">)
which is natural to them. The Jews, having behaved insolently and lived
luxuriously, are deservedly threatened with the vengeance of God, because most
justly is joy taken from us when we know not how to make a right use of the
Lord's benefits, or to rejoice in him. It thus becomes necessary that he should
take away our pleasures and delights, and compel us to sigh and
groan.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
In the city is left desolation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By an elegant
mode of expression he describes the desolation of Jerusalem or of many other

(<i>shammah</i>) is rendered by others <i>desolation</i>, which amounts to the
same thing.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the gate is
smitten with desolation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He mentions the
<i>gates</i>, because in them the crowded population of the city was seen, for
there the people assembled, and there the courts of justice were held. At first,
therefore, he mentions the whole city, and next he names one part of it, but for
the purpose of setting the matter in a stronger light; for although cities be
deprived of their inhabitants, yet some are to be seen in the gates; but if the
gates be altogether empty, there must be grievous solitude in the whole
city.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For it shall be in the midst
of the land.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As this statement is inserted
between the threatenings and the consolation, the Prophet appears to address the
chosen people, and not all the nations indiscriminately; if we do not rather say
that he describes the dispersion, by which the Jews were divided, as it were,
into many nations. But this being a harsh and forced interpretation, I interpret
it as simply meaning that some hope is left to the ruined nations, and certainly
this prediction applies strictly to the kingdom of Christ; and therefore we need
not wonder that some part of the salvation is also promised to the
Gentiles.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As the shaking of an
olive-tree.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet has elsewhere used the
same metaphor, but it was when he spoke of the Church alone.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;231705&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
17:5, 6.) On that occasion he said that some seed of God would be left, that
believers might not think that the Church was utterly ruined; for when "the
olives are shaken," still a few olives are left, and some grapes after the
vintage; and in like manner, after the terrible destruction which shall fall
upon the Church, a small number of the godly will be left. But now he extends
the same promise to other parts of the world, as they were to become partakers
of the same grace through Christ. Yet there is still a mixture of threatening;
as if he had said, that the earth will be deprived of its inhabitants in exactly
the same manner as the trees and vines are stripped of their
fruits.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall lift up their
voice.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He follows out and increases the
consolations which he had briefly sketched; for, having formerly
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;231019&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
10:19-22) said that, out of that vast multitude, a few drops would be left,
which would nevertheless overflow the whole world, in like manner he now says,
that the small number of the godly, which shall be left out of an abundant
vintage, will nevertheless rejoice and utter a voice so loud that it will be
heard in the most distant countries. This was done by the preaching of the
gospel; for, as to the condition of Judea, it appeared to be entirely ruined by
it: the national government was taken away, and they were broken down by foreign
and civil wars in such a manner that they never could rise above them. The rest
of the world was dumb in singing the praises of God, and deaf to hear his voice;
but as the Jews were the first fruits, I shall willingly admit that they are
here placed in the highest rank.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we obtain
a remarkable consolation, that the Lord can in a moment restore his Church, and
make it most flourishing; or rather, he can, as it were, create it out of
nothing; for even out of death, as we have seen, he brings life. Now, this is
contrary to nature and to ordinary custom, that so small a number of persons
should lift up their voice, and be heard in distant places; for where there are
few persons, there is silence, and where there is a crowd, there is commonly a
noise. It is therefore a work of God, which goes beyond the course of nature and
the ability of men; for otherwise it would appear as if the Prophet uttered what
was contradictory, that when the whole of Judea had been laid waste and the
world had been emptied, there would be few or almost none left, and yet that
their shouting would be heard everywhere. This is in itself incredible, or
rather absurd; but, as we have already said, it is an astonishing work of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall cry aloud from
the sea.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By those heralds he means not only
those who were the descendants of the Jews according to the flesh, but those who
were descended from them by faith. The <i>crying aloud</i> denotes not only
cheerful voices, expressive of gladness and joy, but likewise confidence; for
they will freely and boldly utter with a loud voice the praises of God. He
states, at the same time, that it is right that believers should be employed in
extolling God's perfections and not their own claims to approbation. By <i>the
sea</i>, he obviously means distant countries, and those which lay beyond the
sea and were unknown to the
Jews.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Wherefore glorify Jehovah in the valleys.

God's benefits ought to excite us to gratitude, and we testify it by singing his
praises. "What return shall we make," as David says, "for all the benefits which
he has bestowed on us, but to take the cup of thanksgiving for salvation, and
call on the name of the Lord?" The Prophet therefore observes this order; having
spoken of the restoration of the Church, he exhorts us to offer the sacrifice of
praise.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By <i>the valleys</i>, he means
countries that are hidden and, as it were, separated from others; for those
which are surrounded by mountains are separated and disjoined by nature. The
consequence is, that the inhabitants of valleys are less civilized, because they
have fewer opportunities of conversing with each other. The meaning is the same
as if the Prophet had said, that there will not be a corner so obscure or
retired that the praises of God shall not be heard in
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The name of Jehovah the
God of Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He uses the expression, "the
name of the God of Israel," in order to intimate that all nations will call upon
the true God; for, as all nations have a knowledge of God that is natural to
them, so all easily turn aside to superstition and false worship.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450119&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:19.) But here he speaks of spreading the true religion through the whole
world; and this makes it still more evident that the prophecy relates to the
kingdom of Christ, under which true religion has at length penetrated into
foreign and heathen nations.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>

statements which have some appearance of being at variance with each other. It
begins with a joyful description of the praises of God, and next passes on to
complaints and lamentations, in which he bewails the treachery of transgressors,
who overturn religion and godliness. So far as relates to praises, we have said
that we can neither praise God nor call upon him, till he reveal himself to us,
and give a taste of his goodness, that we may entertain hope and confident
expectation of life. Hence those sayings of David,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">When we feel nothing but the wrath of God, we are
dumb to his praises; and therefore when he says that the praises of God will be
heard, he means that the gospel will be spread through the whole world; that men
may acknowledge God to be their Father, and may thus break forth into his
praise. "From the uttermost part" is a phrase that deserves attention; for at
that time the praises of God were confined to Judea, and were not heard at a
distance; but afterwards they began to resound everywhere.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

all believers, as if the song were, "God is glorified on account of his
righteousness." Others read the two clauses as one, "We have heard that glory is
given to the righteous God." Those who think that the heralds of God's praises
are called "righteous," bring out a very good sense, but do not attend to the
word "Glory," or at least are constrained to render the word

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F386</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He makes use of the preterite, "We have heard," instead of the future tense; and
his reason for doing so is, that he intended to cheer the hearts of the godly by
some consolation; "We shall again hear the praises of God; " for this is more
than if he had said, "They will be heard." He speaks also in the first person,
in order to include the whole body of the Church, and thus to awaken the
attention of the godly.</font><br><font face="Palatino">God is called
<i>righteous</i>; and we know that this expression frequently occurs in
Scripture, but it belongs to him in a different manner from that in which it
belongs to men; for men are called "righteous," on account of the
"righteousness" which has been communicated to them; but God, who is the
fountain of righteousness, is called "righteous," on account of what he
performs.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;053204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy

7:9; 11:7.) And that is a proof of this congratulation and thanksgiving, because
from the communication of this righteousness we obtain salvation and life; and
therefore, wherever the righteousness of God is, it must be followed by praises
and thanksgivings.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When the Prophet predicted
these things, how incredible might they appear to be! for among the Jews alone
was the Lord known and praised.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
76:2.) To them destruction is foretold, and next the publication of the word,
and the celebration of the praises of God; but how could these things be done,
when the people of God had been destroyed? Hence we may infer that there were
few who believed these predictions. But now that those events have taken place,
it is our duty to behold with admiration so great a miracle of God, because,
when the Jews had been not only broken down, but almost annihilated, still there
flashed from them a spark by which the whole world was enlightened, and all who
were kindled by it burst forth into a confession of the
truth.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My leanness.
</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F387</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This passage is explained in various ways; for some translate
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yzr
</font><font face="Palatino"><i>(razi</i>) <i>secret</i>, and others
<i>leanness</i>. Those who translate it <i>secret</i> understand the Prophet to
mean that a double secret has been revealed to him, because the Lord has
determined to reward the good and to punish the wicked; for when men look only
at the outward appearance of things, and see that the wicked succeed to their
wish, and that the godly are overwhelmed by afflictions, they are distressed,
and doubt whether the affairs of men are governed by the hand of God, or all
things happen by chance; and Solomon shews that thoughts of this kind are the
seed of ungodliness.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;210811&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ecclesiastes
8:11.) On this account the Psalmist also says, that he "entered into the
sanctuary of God," that he might examine the subject in another manner than by
human reason.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197317&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
73:17.) If we adopt that interpretation, the meaning will be, "Though it appear
as if there were no reward to the righteous, yet I hold this as a secret
imparted to me, that it will be well with them; and although the wicked think
that they will escape, yet I know that they will not pass unpunished." But as
this ingenuity appears to be too far-fetched, I prefer a more simple
interpretation; and, besides, there immediately follows an interjection
expressive of lamentation,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ywa</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>oi</i>,) <i>Woe! </i>so that I do not think that Isaiah speaks here about
the righteous or about their reward.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Others more
correctly explain it <i>leanness</i>; as if he had said, that through grief he
shrinks and grows lean; for as the prosperous and flourishing condition of that
people might be called "fatness," so its wretched and distressed condition might
be called "leanness." Here the Prophet stands forth as the representative of the
whole race; and when the Lord cuts it down, he justly complains of his
"leanness." This interpretation, I have said, is probable; for when the Prophet
saw the people diminishing in numbers, he had good reason for bewailing that
diminution. We know that, when the grace of God was very abundantly poured out,
the ancient people was greatly diminished, and the posterity of Abraham was
almost annihilated.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But we must see if the
Prophet does not look farther than to the rejection of his nation, so as to
bewail the condition of his bowels, when he foresees that the Church will be
heavily distressed; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">zr</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>raz</i>,) which some translate <i>secret</i>, may properly be understood to
denote the internal part of the body in this way the exclamation would be, "My
bowels, or my entrails, are pained; " for in a pathetic discourse there is no
absurdity in supposing that a word is supplied. When the Lord has extended his
Church, it appears to be in a flourishing state, and free from all danger; but
when its very inwards or bowels, that is, its own members, give it uneasiness,
it is grievously tormented. Hypocrites arise, by whom it is more annoyed than by
enemies who "are without."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;662215&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Revelation
22:15.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Such is also the import of those
groaning,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ywa</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>oi</i>,) <i>wo to</i> <i>me</i>; and Isaiah, I have no doubt, intended to
intimate that the godly should not think that they will be happy in this world,
but should believe that they must maintain a continual strife, even when they
might imagine that there is nothing to hinder them from enjoying uninterrupted
tranquillity and peace. He wishes to express the feeling of poignant grief which
torments the Church inwardly, even in her very bowels; and this affliction is
the more deeply to be lamented, because it cannot be avoided; for, as some one
says, the Church can neither flee from internal and domestic enemies, nor put
them to flight. Isaiah can scarcely find terms adequate to express this
miserly</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The treacherous
dealers have dealt treacherously.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> These words
abundantly confirm the expositions which have been already given. How heavy this
affliction is, and how deeply it ought to be deplored, we ourselves have
abundantly experienced, and still experience every day. Whence arose Popery, and
all its corruption, but from this internal evil? for it was an imposthume
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajpo&gt;sthma</font><font face="Palatino">)
bred in the very bowels of the Church, vehicle sent forth offensive and diseased
matter. How comes it also that, when the Church begins to revive, we see
doctrine corrupted and discipline overturned not only by the common people, but
by those who ought to have given a good example to others? Is it not because the
Church is always subject to this
evil?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fear, and the pit, and the
snare.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet here discourses against the
sins of the people. Formerly he declared that not only one nation, but very many
and very distant nations, would have abundant grounds of thanksgiving. He now
passes to another doctrine; for I think that these words ought to be separated
from what goes before, because Isaiah again threatens the wicked, that they may
know that amidst the highest prosperity of the Church they will be miserable.
For the sake of cherishing their indifference, wicked men are accustomed rashly
to apply the promises of God to themselves, though they do not at all belong to
them; and therefore the prophets usually mingle threatenings with them. It is
also possible that Isaiah delivered this discourse separately from the rest, and
on a different occasion; for neither the prophets themselves nor other learned
men divided the chapters. We have often seen different subjects joined together,
and others divided which ought to have been joined, which was undoubtedly done
through ignorance. However that may be, the Prophet returns to the wicked, and
threatens against them severe and dreadful
judgment.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This description of "fear, the pit,
and the snare," is intended to touch the feelings; for if he had said, in a
single word, that destruction awaits the wicked, they would not have been
greatly moved. But there is room for doubting if he addresses the Jews alone.
For my own part, I should not be much inclined to dispute about this matter; but
I think it is more probable that these threatenings related also to other
nations, and even to the whole world, of which he had formally
prophesied.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O inhabitant of
the earth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By "the world" we understand those
countries which were known to the Jews, as we have already explained. The
meaning is, "Thou art pressed by afflictions so diversified, that thou hast no
means of escape." Amos gives a similar description: "He who shall flee through
dread of a lion shall meet a bear; and if he go into the house, when he leaneth
on a wall, a serpent shall bite him."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;300519&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Amos
5:19.) Isaiah formerly said that lions would be sent against the Moabites who
had escaped from the battle.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;231509&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
15:9.) God has an endless variety of scourges for punishing the wicked. It is as
if he had said, "Know that you cannot escape the hand of God; for he has various
methods by which he takes vengeance on their crimes, and thus overtakes those
who had hoped to escape by a variety of contrivances. He who escapes from the
battle shall be tormented with hunger; and when he is freed from hunger, he will
meet some other calamity, as if nets had been laid on all sides to ensnare
you."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the windows from on
high are open, and the foundations of the earth are
shaken.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This argument confirms what had been
already said, that it is impossible for them to escape the vengeance of God, who
has prepared for it a free course in heaven and in earth, from the utmost height
of heaven down to the depths of the earth. Some think that he alludes
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010711&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
7:11) to the deluge; but, in my opinion, the meaning is simpler, that the wrath
of God will be revealed above and below; as if he had said, "The Lord will arm
heaven and earth to execute his vengeance against men, that wherever they turn
their eyes, they may behold nothing but
destruction."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By breaking down is the earth
broken down.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He heightens his description of
punishments by using various modes of expression. A little afterwards he will
point out the cause of this "shaking," which is, that men by their sins had
drawn down on themselves such destruction. He now declares that this evil is
incurable. We have formerly said that the Prophet explains the same thing in
various ways, and for the purpose of striking and arousing those minds which are
naturally very sluggish; for there is in the flesh a carelessness which produces
contempt of God, and we have too much experience of it both in ourselves and in
others. In order, therefore, that the prophets might arouse those who were
careless and asleep in their vices, they adorn their style; not because they
cared about being thought eloquent, but that they might make their hearers more
attentive, and sting them to the quick. Hence the allusions of which these
verses are full; hence the brilliant metaphors in the style; hence the
threatenings and terrors announced in various ways; the object of all is, that
careless men may be aroused.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, this doctrine
ought to be limited to the wicked; not because the godly are exempted from those
evils, for they are afflicted as well as other men; but because, when the godly
betake themselves to God, and rely wholly upon him, they are not shaken in this
manner, and remain firm and steadfast against every assault; while wicked men,
who despised the judgments of God, and took unbounded liberties in
transgression, are terrified and alarmed, and never find
rest.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>And shall be removed like a tent.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">This does not mean that any change will take
place in the position of the earth; but these words, as we have already said,
must be referred to men; as if he had said, that there would be no kingly power
and no regular government. In short, he intended to describe those changes which
he had spoken of in the tenth
chapter.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the
transgressions thereof shall be heavy upon it.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
When he says that "the earth is laden with its iniquity," he has very
appropriately assigned this reason, that we may understand that God is never
angry with men without a cause; for we ourselves are the authors of all the
evils which we suffer. God is by nature disposed to kindness, and regards us
with a father's love; and therefore it is our own fault that we are treated with
sharpness and severity, and we have no reason to blame him.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F388</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
it shall fall, and not rise again.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He at length
repeats what he briefly stated a little before, that there will be no remedy for
those evils. Some think that this relates to the Jews, whose form of government
was entirely taken away, so that they were broken down and scattered, and were
scarcely reckoned in the rank of men. But I give a more extensive
interpretation, that the distresses of the world will be so severe, that it
cannot be restored to its original condition. Men always contend against adverse
events, and their minds are full of confidence. Having endured calamities, they
think that there will be some room for breathing, and their minds are swelled
with false hopes, which the Prophet therefore takes away, that they may not in
future deceive themselves by unfounded expectation. Yet it ought to be observed,
that this general statement does not set aside the exception which Isaiah
formerly made.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall come to
pass.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This passage has tortured the minds of
many commentators, and various interpretations have been offered by various
writers. Some think that this relates to the sun and the stars, and others, that
it relates to the devils, who will be punished along with the wicked. Others
refer it to the Jews, on whom God had bestowed a remarkable privilege. But I
cannot adopt any of those interpretations.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F389</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The simple and genuine meaning, therefore, appears to me to be, that no power
will be so high as to be exempted from those scourges of God; and though they
raise themselves above the clouds, yet the hand of God will reach them; as it is
said in the Psalm,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Whither shall I
go from thy Spirit? and whither shall I flee from thy face? If I ascend into
heaven, thou art there; if I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the
uttermost parts of the sea, there also shall thy hand pursue me."
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D907&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
139:7-10.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah will visit
upon the army on high.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F390</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This is a metaphor by which he denotes kings and princes, who shine and sparkle
in the world like stars; and he afterwards explains this metaphor in direct
language, by adding <i>upon the kings of the earth</i>; for I do not think that
they ought to be separated, as if he were speaking of different subjects, but
that there is a repetition of the same statement, so that the latter clause
explains the former. But perhaps it will be thought preferable to explain it
thus: "he will visit on the kingdoms of the earth," even on those things which
appear to surpass the rank of men; for some things rise so much above others,
that they appear as if they did not belong to the ordinary rank. The word
<i>visit</i> must relate to punishment, as even the context shews plainly
enough.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall be gathered
together, and shall be shut up in prison.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He
continues his subject in the beginning of the verse. The mode of expression is
metaphorical; for they were not all captives, but God reduced them to servitude,
as if a man held in his hand the enemies whom he subdued. He therefore brings
forward God as a conqueror, who shuts up enemies in prison, as captives are
commonly shut up. We know that men, as it were, flee from God, and despise him,
so long as he spares them, and exercises any forbearance towards them; and on
this account also he threatens that they shall be thrown into prison in large
masses, that they may not solace themselves with their
multitude.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Afterwards they
shall be visited.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When he adds that after a
time "they shall be visited," it is not simply a promise, but includes also a
threatening to this effect, "As formerly by their obstinacy they mocked God, and
excessively prolonged the time of sinning, so God will punish without making
haste, till at length, though late, they acknowledge the cause of their
distresses." Thus earthly judges frequently do not deign to admit into their
presence the malefactors who have offended them, but plunge them into darkness
and filth, and gradually wear them out, in order to subdue their obstinacy.
Again, as there are two ways in which God visits the world, either when he
punishes the wicked, or when he shews to the elect the tokens of a Father's
kindness, the word <i>visit</i> here signifies "to look upon; " and thus the
Prophet softens the harshness of the threatening. It was necessary that the
hearts of the godly should be supported amidst these distresses, that they might
not faint; and on their account, therefore, after various threatenings, the
prophets are wont to add consolations. As these statements tended to support
believers, they were undoubtedly addressed to the Jews, among whom chiefly faith
was found, or rather, there was none to be seen anywhere

for we are hasty in our desires, and would wish that God should immediately
perform his promises: we complain that he is slow, and we cannot brook any
delay. It is therefore our duty to wait patiently for that mercy; and no delay,
however long, should make us lose heart. Yet it ought also to be observed, that
this does not refer to all; for, as we saw a little before, God had determined
to save but a small remnant; and this ought to quicken us the more, that, being
humbled by slow and long-continued punishments, we may meet God who visits
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The moon shall be
confounded.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Many commentators think that the
Prophet waxes still more wroth against the Jews, so far as to say, that the sun
and moon and stars are ashamed of their unbelief, and that not only men, but
creatures devoid of speech, will abhor them; but this appears to be far removed
from the meaning and design of the Prophet. I have no doubt that he continues to
give the consolation which he had glanced at in the former verse; "When the Lord
shall visit his people, and cleanse the Church from its defilement, he will
establish a kingdom so illustrious that it will darken the sun and stars by its
brightness." This mode of expression is frequently employed by the prophets, and
we have formerly seen it. Since, therefore, God will establish your kingdom on
Mount Zion, so great will be its splendor in the restoration of the people, that
those things which dazzle the eyes of men, will be dark in comparison of it;
and, for the purpose of expressing this, he has mentioned those objects which
surpass all others in
brightness.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When the Lord of
hosts shall reign in Mount Zion.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> some think
that the word <i>reign</i> denotes God's vengeance; but this is inaccurate, for
although the Lord is said to reign when he discharges the office of a Judge, yet
the complex phrase, "the reign of God in Mount Zion," always denotes mercy and
salvation. He speaks of the restoration of the Church, and hence it follows,
that it is only in Christ that those things are
fulfilled.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And before his
elders glory.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By expressly mentioning the
"elders," he employs a figure of speech frequently used in Scripture, by which
the chief part of the Church is taken for the whole body of it. And yet it is
not without a special design that he denotes, by the term "elders," not only the
priests, but other governors who preside over discipline and morals, and by
whose moderation and prudence others ought to be guided. Under their name he
includes the whole nation, not only because they represent the whole body, and
because the common people are in some measure concealed under their shadow, but
likewise that believers may entertain hope of future restoration; for otherwise
it would have been of little or no avail that a scattered multitude should be
left like a mutilated body or a confused mass. Not without good reason did he
use the phrase, "and before his elders," that the Jews might know that the power
of God would be visibly and strikingly displayed; not that it can be perceived
by the bodily senses, but by faith. He reigns in such a manner, that we feel
that he is present with us; and if we did not comprehend this, it would yield us
no consolation.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Glory.
</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F392</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Instead of "glory" some read "gloriously," and others, "glorious," I prefer to
take it simply as a substantive, though there is little difference in the
meaning. He shews how great will be the splendor and glory of God, when the
kingdom of Christ shall be established, because all that is brilliant must be
obscured, and the glory of Christ alone must hold a high and prominent place.
Hence it follows, that then only does God receive his just rights, and the honor
due to him, when all creatures are placed in subjection, and he alone shines
before our eyes.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Lord, thou art my
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Hitherto Isaiah has prophesied about the
judgments of God, which threatened not only a single nation, but almost the
whole world. Now, it was impossible that the contemplation of calamities so
dismal as those which he foresaw should not give him great uneasiness; for godly
persons would desire that all mankind should be saved, and, while they honor
God, they desire also to love all that belongs to him; and, in short, so far as
any man sincerely fears God, he has a powerful and lively feeling of the divine
judgments. While wicked men stand amazed at the judgments of God, and are not
moved by any terror, godly men tremble at the slightest token of his anger. And
if this be the case with us, what do we suppose was experienced by the Prophet,
who had almost before his eyes those calamities which he foretold? For, in order
that the ministers of the word might be convinced of the certainty of what they
taught, it was necessary that they should be more powerfully impressed by it
than the generality of men.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Since therefore the
Lord held out to Isaiah, as in a picture, those dreadful calamities, he found it
necessary, under the overpowering influence of grief and anxiety, to betake
himself to the Lord; otherwise the confused emotions of his mind would have
agitated him beyond measure. He therefore takes courage from the belief that, in
the midst of these tempests, the Lord still determines to promote the advantage
of his Church, and to bring into subjection to himself those who were formerly
estranged. Isaiah therefore remains firm and steadfast in his calling, and does
not allow himself to be drawn aside from his purpose, but continually relies on
the expectation of mercy, and therefore perseveres in celebrating the praises of
God. Thus we learn that this thanksgiving is connected with the former
prophecies, and that Isaiah considers not only what he foretold, but why the
Lord did it; that is, why the Lord afflicted so many nations with various
calamities. It was, that he might subdue those who were formerly incorrigible,
and who rushed forward with brutal eagerness, who had no fear of God, and no
feeling of religion or
godliness.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou art my
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Being as it were perplexed and confused,
he suddenly raises his thoughts to God, as we have already said. Hence we ought
to draw a very useful doctrine, namely, that when our minds are perplexed by a
variety of uneasy thoughts on account of numerous distresses and afflictions
which happen daily, we ought immediately to resort to God, and rely on his
providence; for even the smallest calamities will overwhelm us, if we do not
betake ourselves to him, and support our hearts by this doctrine. In order to
bring out more fully the meaning of the Prophet, the word <i>but</i> or
<i>nevertheless</i> may be appropriately inserted in this manner: "Whatever
temptations from that quarter may disturb me, nevertheless I will acknowledge
thee to be my God." Thus he promises that he will give to God the praise which
is due to him; and this cannot be, unless a firm belief of his grace dwell in
our hearts, and hold a superiority, from which grace springs a joy, which yields
to us the most abundant ground for praises, when we are certain of our
salvation, and are fully convinced that the Lord is our God. Accordingly, those
who are influenced by no desire to praise God, have not believed and have not
tasted the goodness of God; for if we actually trust in God, we must be led to
take great delight in praising his
name.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thou hast done a
wonderful thing.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He uses the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">alp</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>pele</i>,) <i>wonderful</i>, in the singular number instead of the plural.
The Prophet does not confine his view to the present appearance of things, but
looks to the end; for even men who in other respects are heathens, behold in the
government of the world astonishing events, the sight of which overwhelms them
with amazement; which undoubtedly happened to the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon,
and to the Babylonians and Moabites. But those only who have tasted his goodness
and wisdom can profit by the works of God; for otherwise they undervalue and
despise his works, and do not comprehend their excellence, because they do not
perceive their end, which is, that God, wonderfully bringing light out of
darkness,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 4:6,) raises his Church from death to life, and regulates in the
best manner, and directs to the most valuable purpose, those things which to the
eye of man appear to be
confused.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Counsels which have
been already decreed of old.
</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F393</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Now, in order to bestow still higher commendation on the providence of God, he
adds, that the "counsels have been already decreed of old;" as if he had said,
that to God nothing is sudden or unforeseen. And indeed, though he sometimes
appears to us to act suddenly, yet all things were undoubtedly ordained by him
before the creation of the world.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;441518&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
15:18.) By this word, therefore, the Apostle means that all the miracles which
happen contrary to the expectation of men, are the result of that regular order
which God maintains in governing the world, arranging all things from the
beginning to the end. Now, since we do not understand those secret decrees, and
our powers of understanding cannot rise so high, our attention must therefore be
directed to the manifestation of them; for they are concealed from us, and
exceed our comprehension, till the Lord reveal them by his word, in which he
accommodates himself to our weakness; for his decree is
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnexeu&gt;rhton</font><font face="Palatino">)
unsearchable.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Firm
truth.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F394</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
From the eternal decrees of God the Prophet thus proceeds to doctrines and
promises, which he undoubtedly denotes by the word <i>truth</i>; for the
repetition would be frivolous, if this word did not signify a relation; because,
when God has revealed to us his purpose, if we believe his sayings, he then
appears to be actually true. He commends the firmness and certainty of the word,
when he says that it is "steadfast truth;" that is, that everything that comes
from God, everything that is declared by him, is firm and
unchangeable.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thou hast made of a city a
heap.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some refer this to Jerusalem; but I think
that there is a change of the number, as is very customary with the prophets;
for the Prophet does not speak merely of a single city, but of many cities,
which he says will be reduced to heaps. As to the view held by some, that the
Romans made Jerusalem a palace, it has nothing to do with the Prophet's meaning,
which will be easily enough understood, if we keep in remembrance what has been
already stated, that the Prophet does not confine his thoughts to those
calamities by which the Lord afflicts many nations, but extends his view to the
end of the chastisements. In this manner the Lord determined to tame and subdue
the obstinacy of men, whom he would never have brought into subjection to him
without having been broken down by various
afflictions.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A palace of
foreigners,
</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F395</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
that it may not be a city.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet does not
merely mean that, when the natives have been driven out, "foreigners" wil1
inhabit the cities which have been taken; for that would not agree with what he
immediately adds, "that it may be no longer a city; " but that wandering bands
of men who shall be in want of a habitation will there find abundance of room,
because there will be no inhabitants left. Since!
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wmra</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>armon</i>) denotes a magnificent palace, the Prophet thus says ironically,
that highwaymen will dwell as in palaces, on account of the vast extent of the
place which shall be deserted.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore shall the strong people
glorify thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is the end which I
mentioned;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F396</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for if the Lord should destroy the world, no good result would follow, and
indeed destruction could produce no feeling but horror, and we would never be
led by it to sing his praise; but, on the contrary, we must be deprived of all
feeling, when we perceive nothing but wrath. But praises flow from a sense of
grace and goodness. It is therefore as if he had said, "Thou wilt not only
strike and afflict, O Lord, but wilt cause the chastisements to be not without
effect; for by them thou wilt subdue the fierceness of men, so that those who
were formerly estranged from thee shall bend their neck to thee." This passage
should lead us to observe how much we need chastisements, which train us to
obedience to God; for we are carried away by prosperity to such an extent, that
we think that we have a right to do anything, and we even grow wanton and
insolent when God treats us with
gentleness.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The city of the
terrible nations shall fear thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When the
Prophet next mentions <i>fear</i>, he shews that this praise does not consist in
words or outward gestures, but in the sincere feeling of the heart. Hence we
infer that he now speaks of the entire worship of God; but, as many persons
think that they have fully discharged their duty, as soon as they have made a
confession with the mouth, he adds, for the sake of explanation, "The nations
shall fear thee." When he calls them strong and powerful, by these epithets he
denotes their pride and arrogance; for they were elated by their prosperity.
They rebel against God, and cannot be made humble or submissive, unless they
have been deprived of all things. To such views, therefore, ought our thoughts
to be directed amidst those calamities which we perceive. The fierceness of men
must be restrained and subdued, that they may be prepared for receiving doctrine
and for rendering true obedience. So long as they shall be blinded by their
wealth and vain confidence, they will fearlessly mock at the judgments of God,
and will never yield subjection to
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thou hast been a strength to
the poor.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Hence we see the fruit of conversion,
namely, that the Lord raises us from the dead, and brings us, as it were, out of
the grave, stretching out his hand to us from heaven, to rescue us even from
hell. This is our first access to him, for it is only in our poverty that he
finds the means of exercising his kindness. To us in our turn, therefore, it is
necessary that we be poor and needy, that we may obtain assistance from him; and
we must lay aside all reliance and confidence in ourselves, before he display
his power in our behalf. This is the reason why he visits us with chastisements
and with the cross, by which he trains us, so that we may be able to receive his
assistance and grace.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A refuge
from the storm, a shadow from the heat.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is
not without good reason that Isaiah adorns this description by these
comparisons; for numerous and diversified temptations arise, and, in order to
bear them courageously, it is necessary that the weak minds of men should be
strengthened and fortified. On this account he says that God will be "a strength
to the poor, a refuge from the storms, and a shadow from the heat;" because,
whatever may be the nature of the dangers and assaults which threaten them, the
Lord will protect his people against them, and will supply them with every kind
of armor.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The breath of the

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jwr</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>ruach</i>) signifies "the blowing of the wind," and denotes the tremendous
violence with which wicked men are hurried along against the children of God;
for not only do they "breathe out threatenings and terrors,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;440901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
9:1,) but they appear to vomit out fire
itself.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A
storm</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>flood against the
wall.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is to the same purport as the
former; for by this figure he means, that wicked men, when they obtain liberty
to do mischief, rush on with such violence that they throw down everything that
comes in their way, for to overthrow and destroy walls is more than if the water
were merely flowing over the fields.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As the heat in a dry
place.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> If the Lord did not aid when violent men
rush upon us, our life would be in imminent danger; for we see how great is the
rage of wicked men, and if the Lord overturn walls, what can a feeble man do
against him? These things therefore are added in order to magnify the grace of
God, that we may consider what would become of us if the Lord did not render
assistance.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet there are two ways in which
commentators explain this passage. Some understand it to mean, that wicked men
will be consumed by God's indignation, in the same manner as the violence of the
heat burns up the fields which are in themselves barren. Others render it in the
ablative case, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As if by
heat</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and make the meaning to be, "Though
wicked men, relying on their power, are so violent, yet the Lord will prostrate
them in a moment, as if they were overpowered 'by heat in a dry place.'" But I
consider the meaning to be different, for, after having shewn how great is the
rage of wicked men against believers, he
adds:</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou wilt bring them
down, O Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Alluding to the metaphor of the
deluge, which he had formerly used, he says, "Thou wilt quench their heat, which
would otherwise consume us, even as rain, or a shower, falling from heaven,
quenches the heat that scorched the thirsty fields." And thus the passage flows
naturally; for the other interpretation is forced, and does violence, as the
saying is, to the letter.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
noise of the strong ones will he lay
low.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F397</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This clause is tortured in various ways.
Some think that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rymz</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>zemir</i>) means <i>seed</i>; others that it means <i>a root</i>, as if he
had said, that God will not only destroy wicked men, but will utterly root them
out. This meaning would be probable, were it not opposed by the metaphor of the
heat. In my opinion, therefore, it is more correctly interpreted by others to
mean "singing and shouting," or "cutting off," although even those interpreters
do not fully succeed in getting at the meaning of the Prophet. He therefore
confirms the preceding statement, that the violence of wicked men, or the
shouting which they haughtily and daringly set up, will presently be laid low,
as the heat of the sun is overpowered by the falling rain, which is meant by
<i>the shadow of a</i> <i>cloud</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord of hosts shall
make.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This passage has received various
interpretations. Some think that the Prophet threatens the Jews, and threatens
them in such a manner as to invite various nations to a banquet. This mode of
expression is also found in other passages, for the Lord is said to fatten the
wicked for the day of slaughter. Those commentators think that, as if the Jews
were exposed as a prey to the Gentiles on account of their impiety, the Gentiles
are invited to a banquet; as if the Lord had said, "I have prepared a splendid
entertainment for the Gentiles; the Romans shall plunder and prey on the Jews."
But, in my opinion, that view of the passage cannot be admitted, nor will it be
necessary for me to give a long refutation of it, after having brought forward
the true interpretation. Others explain it as if Isaiah were speaking of the
wrath of God in this manner, "The Lord will prepare a banquet for all nations;
he will give to them to drink the cup of his anger, that they may be
drunken."</font><br><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet had quite a different
meaning, for he proceeds in making known the grace of God, which was to be
revealed by the coming of Christ. He employs the same metaphor which is also
used by David, when he describes the kingdom of Christ, and says,
that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"the poor and the rich
will sit down at this feast,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and
will eat and be satisfied."

<div><font face="Palatino">By this metaphorical language he means, that no class
of men will be excluded from partaking of this generous provision. Formerly it
seemed as if the Lord nourished the Jews only, because they alone were adopted,
and, as it were, invited to the feast provided for his family; but now he admits
the Gentiles also, and extends his beneficence to all
nations.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Will make for all
nations a feast of fat things.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is an
implied contrast when he says, <i>to all nations</i>, for formerly he was known
to one nation only.

(<i>shemarim</i>,) <i>dregs</i>, but inaccurately, for it means "old wines,"
such as the French call, <i>vins de garde</i>, "wines that have been long kept,"
and that are preferable to ordinary wines, especially in an eastern country,
where they carry their age better. He calls them liquids which contain no dregs
or sediment.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In short, it is sufficiently
evident that he does not here threaten destruction against Gentiles or Jews, but
that both are invited together to a very splendid banquet. This is still more
evident from Christ's own words, when he compares the kingdom of heaven to a
marriage-feast which the King prepared for his Son, to which he invites all
without exception, because those who were at first invited refused to come.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew

and as it proceeded from Mount Zion,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
2:3,) he says that the Gentiles will come to it to feast; for when God presents
to the whole world spiritual food for feeding souls, the meaning was the same as
if he had prepared a table for all. The Lord invites us at the present day, that
he may fill and satisfy us with good things; he raises up faithful ministers to
prepare for us that feast, and gives power and efficacy to his word, that we may
be satisfied with it.

this mountain.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As to the word <i>mountain</i>,
though the servants of God do not now come out of the mountain to feed us, yet
by this name we must understand the Church; for nowhere else can any one partake
of this food. That feast is not set down in streets and highways, the table is
not spread everywhere, and this banquet is not prepared in all places, In order
that we may feast, we must come to the Church. That place was mentioned, because
there alone God was worshipped, and revelations proceeded from it; as also the
gospel came forth from it. When he says that this banquet will be rich and
sumptuous, the design of this is to commend the doctrine of the gospel; for it
is the spiritual food with which our souls are fed, and is so exquisitely
delightful that we have no need of any
other.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F400</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Here also commentators differ, for by the word <i>covering</i> is meant the
disgrace with which believers are covered in this world, so that the glory of
God is not seen in them; as if he had said, "Though many reproaches oppress the
godly, yet God will take away those reproaches, and will make their condition
glorious. I pass by other interpretations; but, in my opinion, the true meaning
is, that the Lord promises that he will take away the veil by which they were
kept in blindness and ignorance; and therefore it was by the light of the gospel
that this darkness was
dispelled.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that
mountain.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He says that this will be in mount
Zion, from which also the light of the word shone on the whole world, as we have
already seen.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
2:3.) This passage, therefore, must unavoidably be referred to the kingdom of
Christ; for the light did not shine on all men till Christ, the Sun of
Righteousness, arose,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;390402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
4:2,) who took away all the veils, wrappings, and coverings. And here we have
another commendation of the gospel, that it dispels the darkness, and takes away
from our eyes the covering of errors. Hence it follows, that we are wrapped up
and blinded by the darkness of ignorance, before we are enlightened by the
doctrine of the gospel, by which alone we can obtain light and life, and be
fully restored. Here, too, we have a confirmation of the calling of the
Gentiles, that is, of our calling; for not only the Jews, but all nations, which
formerly were buried in every kind of errors and superstition, are invited to
this banquet.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F401</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The Prophet continues his subject; for in general he promises that there will be
perfect happiness under the reign of Christ, and, in order to express this the
more fully, he employs various metaphors admirably adapted to the subject. That
happiness is real, and not temporary or fading, which not even death can take
away; for amidst the highest prosperity our joy is not a little diminished by
the consideration that it will not always last. He therefore connects two
things, which render happiness full and complete. The first is, that the life is
perpetual; for to those who in other respects are happy for a time, it is a
wretched thing to die. The second is, that this life is accompanied by joy; for
otherwise it may be thought that death would be preferable to a sorrowful and
afflicted life. He next adds that, when all disgrace has been removed, this life
will be glorious; for otherwise less confidence would have been placed in the
prophecy, in consequence of the wretched oppression of the
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But it is asked, To what period must we
refer these promises? for in this world we must contend with various
afflictions, and must fight continually; and not only are we "appointed to
death,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;194422&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461531&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 15:31.) Paul complains of himself and the chief pillars of the
Church, that they are "a spectacle to all men," and endure insults of every
kind, and are even looked upon as
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kaqa&gt;rmata</font><font face="Palatino">)

Corinthians 4:9, 13.) Where or when, therefore, are these things fulfilled? They
must undoubtedly be referred to the universal kingdom of Christ; &#8212;
universal, I say, because we must look not only at the beginning, but also at
the accomplishment and the end: and thus it must be extended even to the second
coming of Christ, which on that account is called "the day of redemption" and
"the day of restoration;" because all things which now appear to be confused
shall be fully restored, and assume a new form.

as that deliverance might be regarded as the earnest and foretaste of another,
this promise must undoubtedly be extended to the last
day.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Let us therefore direct all our hope and
expectation to this point, and let us not doubt that the Lord will fulfill all
these things in us when we have finished our course. If we now "sow in tears,"
then undoubtedly we shall "reap with joy" and ecstasy.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19C605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
126:5.) Let us not dread the insults or reproaches of men, which will one day
procure for us the highest glory. Having obtained here the beginnings of this
happiness and glory, by being adopted by God, and beginning to bear the image of
Christ, let us firmly and resolutely await the completion of it at the last
day.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For Jehovah hath spoken
it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> After so many dreadful calamities, it might
be thought that such an event was incredible; and therefore the Prophet shews
that it proceeds not from man, but from God. When Jerusalem had been overthrown,
the worship of God taken away, the temple destroyed, and the remnant of the
people oppressed by cruel tyranny, no man would have believed it to be possible
that everything would be raised to its original condition. It was necessary to
combat with this distrust, to which men are strongly inclined; and therefore the
Prophet confirms and seals these
promises.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Know that God
communicated to me these declarations; fix your minds therefore on him, and not
on me; let your faith rely on him 'who cannot lie' or deceive."

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rma</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>amar</i>) is indefinite, "He shall say;" but as the discourse does not
relate to one or another individual, but to all in general, I chose to render it
in a passive form.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F403</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This is an excellent conclusion; for it shews that God's benefits are not in any
respect doubtful or uncertain, but are actually received and enjoyed by men. The
Prophet declares that the banquet, of which he formerly spoke, (verse 6,) will
not in vain be prepared by God; for men shall feast on it, and possess
everlasting joy.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lo, this is
our God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> That joyful shout, which he declares
will be public, is the actual test and proof, so to speak, of the experience of
the grace of God. This passage ought to be carefully observed; for the Prophet
shews that there will be such a revelation as shall fix the minds of men on the
word of God, so that they will rely on it without any kind of hesitation; and if
these things belong, as they undoubtedly do belong, to the kingdom of Christ, we
derive from them this valuable fruit, that Christians, unless they are wanting
to themselves, and reject the grace of God, have undoubted truth on which they
may safely rely. God has removed all ground of doubt, and has revealed himself
to them in such a manner, that they may venture freely to declare that they know
with certainty what is his will, and may say with truth what Christ said to the
Samaritan woman, "We worship what we know."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430422&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
4:22.) Having been informed by the gospel as to the grace offered through
Christ, we do not now wander in uncertain opinions, as others do, but embrace
God and his pure worship. Let us boldly say, "Away with all the inventions of
men!"</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is proper to observe the contrast
between that dark and feeble kind of knowledge which the fathers enjoyed under
the law, and the fullness which shines forth to us in the gospel. Though God
deigned to bestow on his ancient people the light of heavenly doctrine, yet he
made himself more familiarly known through Christ, as we are told; "No man hath
seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father,
hath declared him."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430118&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
1:18.) The Prophet now extols that certainty which the Son of God brought to us
by his coming, when he "sheweth to us the Father."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431409&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
14:9.) Yet, while we excel the ancient people in this respect, that the
reconciliation obtained through Christ makes God, as it were, more gracious to
us, there is no other way in which God can be known but through Christ, who is
"the pattern and image of his substance."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580103&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
1:3.) "He who knoweth not the Son, knoweth not the Father."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
14:7.) Though Jews, Mahometans, and other infidels, boast that they worship God,
the creator of heaven and earth, yet they worship an imaginary God. However
obstinate they may be, they follow doubtful and uncertain opinions instead of
the truth; they grope in the dark, and worship their own imagination instead of
God. In short, apart from Christ, all religion is deceitful and transitory, and
every kind of worship ought to be abhorred and boldly
condemned.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Nor is it without good reason that
the Prophet employs not only the adverb <i>Lo</i>, but the demonstrative pronoun
<i>This,</i>
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F404</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in order to attest more fully the presence of God, as, a little afterwards, by
repeating the declaration of certainty and confidence, he expresses the
steadfastness that will be found in those who shall worship God through Christ.
It is certain that we cannot comprehend God in his majesty, for he "dwelleth in
unapproachable light,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;540616&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 6:16,) which will immediately overpower us, if we attempt to rise to it;
and therefore he accommodates himself to our weakness, gives himself to us
through Christ, by whom he makes us partakers of wisdom, righteousness, truth,
and other blessings.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460130&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 1:30.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is worthy of observation that, when
he calls Christ the God of believers, he gives to him the name "Jehovah;" from
which we infer that the actual eternity of God belongs to the person of Christ.
Besides, since Christ has thus made himself known to us by the gospel, this
proves the base ingratitude of those who, not satisfied with so full a
manifestation, have dared to add to it their own idle speculation, as has been
done by Popery.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have waited
for him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He expresses the firmness and
perseverance of those who have once embraced God in Christ; for it ought not to
be a temporary knowledge, but we must persevere in it steadfastly to the end.
Now, Isaiah speaks in the name of the ancient Church, which at that time had its
seat, strictly speaking, among the Jews alone; and therefore, despising as it
were all the gods that were worshipped in other countries, he boldly declares
that he alone, who revealed himself to Abraham,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
15:1,) and proclaimed his law by the hand of Moses,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;022001&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
20:1, 2,) is the true God. Other nations, which were involved in the darkness of
ignorance, did not "wait for" the Lord: for this "waiting" springs from faith,
which is accompanied by patience, and there is no faith without the
word.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Thus he warns believers that their
salvation rests on hope and expectation; for the promises of God were as it were
suspended till the coming of Christ. Besides, we ought to observe what was the
condition of those times; for it appeared as if either the promise of God had
come to nought, or he had rejected the posterity of Abraham. Certainly, though
they looked very far, God did not at that time appear to them; and therefore
they must have been endued with astonishing patience to endure such heavy and
sharp temptations. Accordingly, he bids them wait quietly for the coming of
Christ; for then they will clearly perceive how near God is to them that worship
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The same doctrine ought to soothe us in the
present day, so that, though our salvation be concealed, still we may "wait for
the Lord" with firm and unshaken hope, and, when he is at a distance, may always
say, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lo, here he
is.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In times of the greatest confusion, let us
learn to distinguish him by this mark,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is
he</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F405</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
As to the words, though he says, in the past tense,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F406</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
"We rejoiced and were glad in his salvation;" yet the words denote a continued
act; and, a little before, he had said in the future tense, "He will save us."
The meaning may be thus summed up, "Christ will never disappoint the hopes of
his people, if they call on him with
patience."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the hand of Jehovah shall
rest.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The design of the Prophet in the
beginning of this verse, I have no doubt, was to comfort the godly, who but for
this would have thought that God had forsaken and abandoned them; for the
opinion of those who view it as describing the judgment which the Lord was about
to execute on the Jews, has no foundation whatever; but the meaning is the same
as if he had said, that the Lord will always assist his Church. I am aware that
"the hand of God" rests also on the reprobate, when he does not cease to pursue
them with his vengeance, till he completely overwhelm them; but here the word
"hand" denotes assistance, and not chastisements, and therefore by the word
"rest," is meant the uninterrupted continuance of defense or
protection.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We draw from this a profitable
doctrine, that although God scatters innumerable blessings over the whole world,
in such a manner that wicked men also obtain a share of them, yet his "hand"
does not "rest," or is not continually present, but in the holy <i>mountain</i>;
that is, in the Church, where he is worshipped. It ought also to be observed,
that Jerusalem had been chastised, before she received these blessings; for he
had formerly threatened chastisements and punishments, to which he added this
consolation.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moab shall be
trodden down under him. </i></font><font face="Palatino">In this clause he gives
an additional view of the grace of God; for, by inflicting punishment on the
enemies of the Church, he will shew how dearly he values its salvation. The Jews
had no enemies more deadly than the Moabites, though their ancestors
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F407</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
were near relatives. By a figure of speech
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sunekdocikw~v</font><font face="Palatino">)
in which a part is taken for the whole, he includes under this name all the
enemies of the Church, and especially those who are somewhat related to them,
and who are more destructive than all others. He shews that, though for a time
they are victorious and oppress the Church, yet eventually they shall be
punished. His object is, that under their afflictions believers may not lose
heart, as if their condition were unhappy, while wicked men are cheerful and
prosperous; for the "treading down," which is here mentioned, will quickly
follow. Consequently, if at the present day we see the Church disturbed and
oppressed by those who are somewhat related to us, and who even assume the name
and title of the Church, let us comfort our hearts by this
promise.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As straw is trodden
down in the dunghills.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F408</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnmdm</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>Madmenah</i>,) which we translate "dunghill,"
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F409</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is supposed by some to be the name of a city, which is also mentioned by
Jeremiah,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;244802&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
48:2.) But what if we should say that the Prophet alludes to the city, which was
probably situated in a fertile soil, and thus conveys a stronger censure, and
presses harder on the Moabites? As if he had said, "As straw is trodden down in
their fields, so will the Lord tread down the Moabites." I do not dislike other
interpretations, but consider it to be not improbable that he alludes to the
fertility of the soil in which that city was situated. Yet in my version I have
not hesitated to follow the common
opinion.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he shall spread
out.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet now explains and confirms the
former statement; but he employs a different metaphor, by which he means, that
the Lord will spread out his hand to the innermost part of the country of Moab,
and not merely to its extremities. Some explain the metaphor thus: "As the arms
are stretched out in swimming, so the Lord will chastise the Moabites on all
sides." Others think that it expresses the doubling of punishments, as if he had
said, "The Lord will not only punish the Moabites, but will again and again take
vengeance for the cruelty which they exercised against the children of
God."</font><br><font face="Palatino">But we might take another way of
explaining that metaphor. Those who swim do not rush forward with the utmost
violence, but gently spread out and quickly draw back their arms, and yet they
cut and subdue the waters. In like manner, the Lord does not always put forth
great strength to cut down the wicked, but without any effort, without the use
of armies, without any noise or uproar, he destroys and puts them to flight,
however valiant or well prepared for battle they may appear to be. And I approve
of this explanation, because it takes nothing from the meaning formerly given,
and explains more clearly, that the wicked are often brought to nothing by the
hand of God, though he do not openly thunder from heaven. When he says,
"</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the midst of
it</i></font><font face="Palatino">," he shews that no part will be hidden in
such a manner as not to be overtaken by this
vengeance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the
fortress.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet now directs his discourse
to the country of Moab. It was highly fortified, and was proud of its walls and
fortifications; and he affirms that the lofty towers, and other defences,
however strong and seemingly impregnable, will be of no avail. The ancients, it
is well known, had quite a different method of fortifying from what is practiced
among us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will bring down,
lay low, and cast to the ground.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The three
words here employed, for conveying the meaning more strongly, are not
superfluous; for it was necessary to beat down that pride which swelled the
hearts of the Moabites, and which, as we formerly saw,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F410</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
made them intolerable. The Prophet therefore mocks at them, "As if the Lord
could not cast down that loftiness of which you
boast!"</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the
dust.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The meaning of this clause is as if he
had said, "He will not only level it with the ground, but will reduce it <i>to
dust</i>, so that there will not even be a trace of the ancient ruin." This
passage contains an excellent and highly seasonable consolation; for the enemies
of the Church in the present day are so haughty, that they mock not only at men,
but at God himself, and are so much swelled and puffed up by their power, that
they imagine themselves to be invincible; but, in opposition to their bulwarks
and defences, we ought to bring forward this declaration of the Prophet, "The
Lord will quickly bring down and lay them low." Yet we must patiently endure to
see them strong and powerful, till the full time for their destruction
arrive.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that day shall a song be
sung.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here the Prophet begins again to shew
that, after the return of the people from captivity, they will be defended by
God's power and guardianship, and that under his protection Jerusalem will lie
as safe as if she had been surrounded by bulwarks, ramparts, a ditch, and a
double wall so that no enemy could find
entrance.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is proper to observe the time when
"this song was sung." The Prophet had foretold the calamity that would befall
the Church, which was not yet so near at hand, but happened a short time after
his death. When the people were led into captivity, they would undoubtedly have
despaired, if they had not been encouraged by such promises. That the Jews might
cherish a hope that they would be delivered, and might behold life in the midst
of death, the Prophet composed for them this song, even before the calamity
occurred, that they might be better prepared for enduring it, and might hope for
better things. I do not think that it was composed solely that, when they had
been delivered, they might give thanks to God, but that even during their
captivity, though they were like dead men,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;263701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
37:1,) they might strengthen their hearts with this confidence, and might also
train up their children in this expectation, and hand down these promises, as it
were, to posterity.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We have formerly
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F411</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
seen the reason why these and other promises were put by Isaiah into the form of
verse. It was, that, having been frequently sung, they might make a deeper
impression on their memory. Though they mourned in Babylon, and were almost
overwhelmed with sorrow, (hence these sounds,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D704&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
137:4,) "How can we sing the Lord's song in a foreign land?") yet they must have
hoped that at a future period, when they should have returned to Judea, they
would give thanks to the Lord and sing his praises; and therefore the Prophet
shews to them at a distance the day of deliverance, that they may take courage
from the expectation of it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We
have a city of strength.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By these words a full
restoration of Jerusalem and of the people is promised, because God will not
only deliver the captives and gather those that are scattered, but will also
preserve them safe, after having brought them back to their country. But not
long afterwards believers saw that Jerusalem was destroyed,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;122509&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 25:9,) and the Temple thrown down,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;143619&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 36:19,) and after their return nothing could meet their eye but
hideous ruins; and all this Isaiah had previously foretold. It was therefore
necessary that they should behold from the lofty watch-tower of faith this
restoration of Jerusalem.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He
hath made salvation to be walls and a bulwark.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
He now defines what will be "the strength of the city;" for the "salvation" of
God will supply the place of a "wall," towers, ditches, and mounds. As if he had
said, "Let other cities rely on their fortifications, God alone will be to us
instead of all bulwarks." Some allege that the words may be read, "He hath set a
wall and bulwark for salvation;" and I do not set aside that rendering. But as a
more valuable doctrine is contained in the Prophet's words, when nothing is
supplied, it serves no good purpose to go far for a forced interpretation;
especially since the true and natural interpretation readily presents itself to
the mind, which is, that God's protection is more valuable than all ditches and
walls. In like manner, it is also said in the psalm, "Thy mercy is better than
life,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;196303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
63:3;) for as David there boasts of enjoying, under God's shadow, greater safety
and freedom from care than if he had been fortified by every kind of earthly
defense, so Isaiah here says, that there will be good reason for laying aside
fear, when God shall have undertaken to guard his people. Now, since this
promise extends to the whole course of redemption, we ought to believe that at
the present day God is still the guardian of his Church, and therefore, that his
power is of more avail than if it had been defended by every kind of military
force. Accordingly, if we wish to dwell in safety, we must remain in the Church.
Though we have no outward defences, yet let us learn to be satisfied with the
Lord's protection, and with his sure salvation, which is better than all
bulwarks.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Open ye the gates.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This "song" was undoubtedly
despised by many, when it was published by Isaiah; for during his life, the
inhabitants of Jerusalem were wicked and ungodly, and the number of good men was
exceedingly small. But after his death, when they had been punished for their
wickedness, it was in some measure perceived that this prediction had not been
uttered in vain. So long as wicked men enjoy prosperity, they have no fear, and
do not imagine that they can be brought low. Thus the Jews thought that they
would never be driven out of Judea, and carried into captivity, and hoped that
they would continue to dwell there. It was therefore necessary to take away from
them every pretense for being haughty and insolent; and such is the import of
the Prophet's words:</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And a
righteous nation, which keepeth the truth, shall enter
in.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> "The inhabitants of the restored city shall
be unlike the former; for they will maintain righteousness and truth. But at
that time this promise also might appear to have failed of its accomplishment;
for when they had been driven out of the country and led into captivity, no
consolation remained. Accordingly, when the Temple had been destroyed, the city
sacked, and all order and government overthrown and destroyed, they might have
objected, "Where are those 'gates' which he bids us 'open?' Where are the people
who shall 'enter?' Yet we see that these things were fulfilled, and that nothing
was ever foretold which the Lord did not accomplish. We ought, therefore, to
keep before our minds those ancient histories, that we may be fortified by their
example, and, amidst the deepest adversity to which the Church is reduced, may
hope that the Lord will yet raise her up
again.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When the Prophet calls the nation
"righteous and truthful," he not only, as I mentioned a little before, describes
the persons to whom this promise relates, but shews the fruit of the
chastisement; for when its pollution shall have been washed away, the holiness
and righteousness of the Church shall shine more brightly. At that time wicked
men were the majority, good men were very few, and were overpowered by the
multitude of those who were of an opposite character. It was therefore necessary
that that multitude, which had no fear of God, and no religion, should be taken
away, that God might gather his remnant. Thus, it was a compensation for the
destruction, that Jerusalem, which had been polluted by the wickedness of her
citizens, again was actually devoted to God; for it would not have been enough
to regain prosperity, if newness of life had not shone forth in holiness and
righteousness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, as the Prophet foretells the
grace of God, so he also exhorts the redeemed people to maintain uprightness of
life. In short, he threatens that these promises will be of no avail to
hypocrites, and that the gates of the city will not be opened for them, but only
for the righteous and holy. It is certain that the Church was always like a
barn,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
3:12,) in which the chaff is mingled with the wheat, or rather the wheat is
overpowered by the chaff; but when the Jews had been brought back into their
country, the Church was unquestionably purer than before. Those who returned
must have been animated by a good disposition, to undertake a journey so long,
and beset by so many annoyances, embarrassments, and dangers; and many others
chose rather to remain in captivity than to return, thinking that to dwell in
Babylon was a safer and more peaceful condition than to return to Judea. Such
persons must have had a seed of piety, which led them to take possession of
those promises which were granted to the fathers. Now, though the Church even at
that time was stained by many imperfections, still this description was
comparatively true; for a large portion of the filth had been swept away, and
those who remained had profited in some degree under God's
chastisements.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A righteous
nation, which keepeth the truth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some
distinguish these terms in this manner, "A nation <i>righteous</i> before God,
and <i>upright</i> before men." But I take the meaning to be more simple; that,
after having called the nation "righteous," he shews in what righteousness
consists; that is, where there is uprightness of heart, which has nothing
feigned or hypocritical, for nothing is more opposite to righteousness than
hypocrisy. And though no man ever existed who advanced so far that he could
receive the commendation of being perfectly righteous, yet the children of God,
who with their whole heart aim at this "truth," may be said to be keepers of it.
But perhaps it will rather be thought that, by a figure of speech, one part is
taken for the whole, to describe what is true righteousness; that is, when all
deceit and all wicked practices have been laid aside, and men act towards each
other with sincerity and truth.</font><br><font face="Palatino">If any man wish
to make use of this passage for upholding the merits of men, the answer is easy;
for the Prophet does not here describe the cause of salvation, or what men are
by nature, but what God makes them by his grace, and what kind of persons he
wishes to be members of his Church. Out of wolves he makes sheep, as we have
formerly seen.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F412</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
So long as we live here, we are always at a great distance from perfection, and
are in continual progress towards it; but the Lord judges of us according to
that which he has begun in us, and, having once led us into the way of
righteousness, reckons us to be righteous. As soon as he begins to check and
reform our hypocrisy, he at once calls us true and
upright.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The thought is fixed; thou wilt
keep peace, peace.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F413</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
As the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rxy</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>Yetzer</i>) signifies both "imagination" or "creature," and "thought," some
render it, "By a settled foundation thou wilt keep peace; " as if the Prophet
meant, that when men, amidst the convulsions of the world, continue to rest
firmly on God, they will always be safe. Others render it, "For the fixed
thought thou wilt keep peace; " which amounts to nearly the same thing, that
they who have fixed their minds on God alone will at length be happy; for in no
other way does God promise that he will be the guardian of his people than when
they rely on his grace with settled thoughts, and without change or wavering.
Since, however, the sign of the dative case is not added, but the Prophet in a
concise manner of expression says, "Fixed or steadfast thought," let my readers
judge if it be not more appropriate to view it as referring to God, so as to
make the meaning to be, that the peace of the Church is founded on his eternal
and unchangeable purpose; for, in order to prevent godly minds from continual
wavering, it is of the highest importance to look to the heavenly
decree.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is undoubtedly true that we ought
constantly to hope in God, that we may perceive his continual faithfulness in
defending us; and believers are always enjoined not to be driven about by any
doubt, or uncertainty, or wavering, but firmly to rely on God alone. Yet the
meaning which is more easily obtained from this passage, and comes more
naturally from the words of the Prophet, is, that it is a fixed and unchangeable
decree of God, that all who hope in him shall enjoy eternal peace; for if
<i>fixed thought</i> means the certainty and steadfastness of the godly, it
would be superfluous to assign the reason, which is
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because he hath
trusted in thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In short, both modes of
expression would have been harsh, that "continual peace is prepared for
imagination," or "for thought." But it is perfectly appropriate to say that,
when we trust in God, he never disappoints our hope, because he has determined
to guard us for ever. Hence it follows, that, since the safety of the Church
does not depend on the state of the world, it is not moved or shaken by the
various changes which happen daily; but that, having been founded on the purpose
of God, it stands with steady and unshakable firmness, so that it can never
fall.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There is also, I think, an implied
contrast between God's fixed thought and our wandering imaginations; for at
almost every moment there springs up something new which drives our thoughts
hither and thither, and there is no change, however slight, that does not
produce some doubt. We ought therefore to hold this principle, that we do wrong
if we judge of God's unshaken purpose by our fickle imaginations; as we shall
elsewhere see,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"As far as the heavens

<div><font face="Palatino">We ought therefore above all to hold it certain, that
our salvation is not liable to change; because the purpose of God is
unchangeable.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou wilt keep
peace, peace.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What has now been stated explains
the reason of the repetition of the word <i>peace</i>; for it denotes
uninterrupted continuance for ever. By the word <i>peace</i> I understand not
only serenity of mind, but every kind of happiness; as if he had said, that the
grace of God alone can enable us to live prosperously and
happily.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Trust ye in Jehovah for
ever.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As to the words, some read in the second
clause, "Trust in God, the strong Jehovah of ages;" but as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwx</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>tzur</i>) is not always an adjective, but signifies <i>strength</i>, I
reject that meaning as forced, besides that it has little relation to the
subject, as will immediately appear. There is also little ground for the
ingenuity of those who infer from this passage the divinity of Christ, as if the
Prophet said, that "Jehovah is in Jah;" for the twofold name of God is given for
the express purpose of magnifying his power.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He
now exhorts the people to rest safely on God, and therefore, after the preceding
doctrine, there is now room for exhortation. Besides, it would have been vain to
say that our peace is in the hand of God, and that he is our faithful guardian,
if we had not been taught and instructed on this subject, and at the same time
urged by exhortations. Yet he exhorts us not only to earnest hope, but to
perseverance; and this discourse implies properly to believers, who have already
learned what it is to trust in the Lord, and who need to be strengthened,
because they are still weak, and may often fall, in consequence of the various
motives to distrust with which they are called to struggle. He therefore does
not enjoin them merely to trust in the Lord, but to remain steadfastly in trust
and confidence to the end.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For
in Jah Jehovah is the strength of
ages.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F414</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We ought to attend to the reason which
is here assigned, namely, that as the power of God, which is the object of
faith, is perpetual, so faith ought to be extended so as to be equally
perpetual. When the Prophet speaks of the strength and power of God, he does not
mean power which is unemployed, but power active and energetic, which is
actually exerted on us, and which conducts to the end what he had begun. And
this doctrine has a wider application, for it bids us truly believe that we
ought to contemplate the nature of God; for, as soon as we turn aside from
beholding it, nothing is seen but what is fleeting, and then we immediately
faint. Thus ought faith to rise above the world by continual advances; for
neither the truth, nor the justice, nor the goodness of God, is temporary and
fading, but God continues always to be like
himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For he will bring down the
inhabitants of loftiness.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F415</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He now explains more fully what is that power of God of which he spoke. It is
that which we ourselves feel, and which is exerted for our benefit. The two
clauses are therefore closely connected, that "the proud are laid low by the
power of God," and that "the lowly and despised are placed in their room;" for
it would not have yielded full consolation to tell us, in the first place, that
"the proud will be laid low," if he had not likewise added, that "the lowly will
be exalted," so as to hold dominion over the proud. We therefore acknowledge,
that in our own experience God works powerfully for our salvation, and this
yields to us a ground of hope.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Under the word
<i>loftiness</i> he includes not only bulwarks and fortifications of every kind,
(for the ancients were wont to build their cities in lofty places,) but also
wealth and magnificence. He therefore means, that no defense can prevent God
from casting down the wicked, and laying them low. Towers and bulwarks, indeed,
are not displeasing to God; but as it rarely happens that they who are strong
and powerful are not proud, so <i>loftiness</i> frequently denotes <i>pride</i>.
Unquestionably he speaks of the wicked, who have abundance of arms, forces, and
money, and imagine that they are protected against God himself. He likewise
comforts the Jews, as we have formerly said,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F416</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because the invincible power of Babylon might have terrified them and thrown
them into despair, if the Lord had not supported them by this promise: "You have
no reason for being terrified at the greatness or strength of Babylon; for she
will quickly fall, and will not stand before the power of the
Lord."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Straightnesses are the way of the
righteous man. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He does not praise the
righteousness of the godly, as some have falsely supposed, but shews that,
through the blessing of God, they are prosperous and successful during the whole
course of their life. Having only stated briefly in the beginning of the verse,
that "their ways are plain and smooth," he explains more fully in the second
clause, ascribing it to the grace of God that in an open plain, as it were, the
righteous proceed in their course, till they reach the
goal.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou wilt weigh the
straight path of the righteous.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The word
<i>weigh</i> contains a metaphor, that God, by applying a balance, as it were,
brings to an equal measure those things which in themselves were unequal. The
Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;y</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>yashar</i>) is ambiguous, for it may refer either to God or to the path.
Accordingly some render it, <i>Thou, who art upright, will direct the path of
the righteous</i>;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F417</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and in other passages God is called <i>upright</i>.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;053204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
32:4;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;192508&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
25:8.) There would also be propriety in the allusion, that the
<i>straightness</i> of which he spoke proceed from God, for he alone is
<i>straight</i> or <i>upright</i>. But the other version appears to be more
natural.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F418</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">He
promises in general, that God will take care of the righteous, so as to lead
them, as it were, by his hand. When the wicked prosper and the righteous are
oppressed, everything in this world appears to be moved by chance; and although
Scripture frequently declares and affirms that God takes care of them,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193705&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
37:5;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600507&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 5:7,) yet we can scarcely remain steadfast, but waver, when everything
that happens to them is unfavourable. Yet it is true that the ways of the
righteous are made plain by God's balance, however rough and uneven they may
appear to be; and not only so, but he has committed them to the guardianship of
his angels, "lest they should be injured, or dash their foot against a stone."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;199111&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
91:11.) But for this, they would easily fall or give way through exhaustion, and
would hardly ever make way amidst so many thorns and briers, steep roads,
intricate windings, and rough places, did not the Lord lead out and deliver
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Let us therefore learn to commit ourselves
to God, and to follow him as our leader, and we shall be guided in safety.
Though snares and artifices, the stratagems of the devil and wicked men, and
innumerable dangers, may surround us, we shall always be enabled to escape. We
shall feel what the Prophet says here, that our ways, even amidst deep chasms,
are made plain, so that there is no obstacle to hinder our progress. And,
indeed, experience shews, that if we are not led by God's guidance, we shall not
be able to push our way through rugged roads; for so great is our weakness that
we shall scarcely advance a single step without stumbling at the smallest stone
that comes in our way. Satan and wicked men not only entangle and delay us by
many perplexities, and not only present to us slight difficulties, but cause us
to encounter sometimes high mounds and sometimes deep pits, which even the whole
world would be unable to avoid.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is therefore
proper for us to acknowledge how much we need heavenly direction, and to confess

judgments.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This verse contains a very beautiful
doctrine, without which it might have been thought that the former statements
were without foundation. Since he said that God will be our guide during the
whole of life, so that we shall neither wander nor stumble, and while, on the
other hand, we are pressed by so many straits, we might conclude that those
promises have not been actually fulfilled. Accordingly, when he tries our
patience, we ought to strive, and yet to trust in him. Here the Prophet gives us
this instruction, that, though our eyes are not gratified by an easy and
delightful path, and though the road is not made smooth under our feet, but we
must toil through many hard passages, still there is room for hope and
patience.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By

<i>judgment</i> often has this meaning in Scripture. But here is a mark which
distinguishes the godly from hypocrites; for in prosperity hypocrites bless God,
and speak highly of him; but in adversity they murmur, and curse God himself,
and plainly shew that they had no confidence in him, and thus judge of God
according as their prosperity lasts. The godly on the other hand, when they are
tried by afflictions and calamities, are more and more excited to place
confidence.

(<i>aph</i>,) <i>Even</i>, is inserted for the sake of emphasis, as if the
Prophet had said, that believers are earnest in the worship of God, not only so
long as he treats them with gentleness, but that, if he deal harshly with them,
still they do not faint, because they are supported by hope. It is therefore the
true test of sincere godliness, when not only while God bestows his kindness
upon us, but while he withdraws his face, and afflicts us, and gives every sign
of severity and displeasure, we place our hope and confidence in him. Let us
learn to apply this doctrine to our own use, whenever we are hard pressed by the
calamities of the present life; and let us not cease to trust in him, even when
our affairs are in the most desperate condition.

"Though He slay me," says Job, "I will trust in Him;" and David says that:
"though he walk amidst the shadow of death, he will trust and not be afraid,
because he knows that God is with him."

name.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet aims at shewing what is the
source of that uwearied earnestness which prevents the godly from sinking under
the greatest calamities. It is because they are free from wicked desires and
from excessive solicitude, and in their aspirations boldly rise to God. For, in
consequence of our disorderly passions and cares holding us bound, as it were,
to the earth, our hearts either wander astray, or sink into indolence, so that
they do not freely rise to God; and as the essence of God is hidden from us,
this makes us more sluggish in seeking him. From his hidden and incomprehensible
essence, therefore, the Prophet draws our attention to the name of God, as if he
enjoined us to rest satisfied with that manifestation of it which is found in
the word; because there God declares to us, as far as is necessary, his justice,
wisdom, and goodness, that is,
himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And to the
remembrance of thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is not without good
reason also that he has added the word <i>remembrance</i>; for it means that the
first perception or thought is not enough, but that continual meditation is
enjoined; because without its aid all the light of doctrine would immediately
vanish away. And indeed the true and sincere knowledge of God inflames us to
desire him, and not only so, but also prompts us to desire to make progress,
whenever the "remembrance" of it occurs to our minds. The knowledge of God,
therefore, comes first; and next, we must be employed in frequent "remembrance;"
for it is not enough that we have once obtained knowledge, if love and desire do
not grow through constant meditation. Hence, also, we perceive that the
knowledge of God is not a dead
imagination.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My soul hath desired thee.</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">This is a stronger expression of the former
statement; for, having previously spoken in the person of believers, he had said
that the desire of their soul was towards God. He now adds, with regard to
himself, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My soul hath
desired</i></font><font face="Palatino">; as if he had said, "I have all the
faculties of my soul directed towards seeking thy name." The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;pn</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>nephesh</i>) frequently denotes the vital <i>Soul</i>; but as the Prophet
here employs two words, I distinguish them so as to make
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;pn</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>nephesh</i>) mean the desire or will, and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jwr</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>ruach</i>) the intellectual parts; for we know that these are the chief
parts of the human soul, namely, the Understanding and the Will, both of which
God justly claims for himself. Such is also the import of that passage, "Thou
shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy mind, and with all
thy strength."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
6:5;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402237&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
22:37.) The Prophet therefore shews, that all the faculties of his soul are
directed to this point, to seek God and embrace
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Others take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jwr</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>ruach</i>,) <i>the Spirit</i>, to mean the regenerated part; and so by
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;pn</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>nephesh</i>) they understand the natural soul, and by
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jwr</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>ruach</i>,) <i>the Spirit</i>, they understand the grace of God, which is
supernatural. But this cannot be admitted; for the sensual man
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">yuciko&gt;v</font><font face="Palatino">)
never seeks God; and we perceive how strongly we are opposed by our feelings
when we rise to God, and with what difficulty we conquer that aversion. It is
unnecessary, therefore, to refute this interpretation, for it is directly
contrary to Scripture; and from many similar passages it is sufficiently plain
that the Spirit and Soul mean the understanding and the
heart.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the
night.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By <i>the night</i> Scripture often
means adversity, which is compared to darkness and gloominess. But I interpret
it somewhat differently, as if the Prophet had said, "There is no time so
improper or unreasonable that I may not call upon thee or pray to thee." That
interpretation differs little from the former, but is rather more general; for
night is supposed to be set apart for rest, and at that time all the desires and
labors of men
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F421</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
cease; and, in short, there is little difference between a sleeping and a dead
man. He says, therefore, that at the time which is devoted to rest and repose he
rises to seek God, so that no occasion turns him aside; &#8212; not that those
who are asleep have any active thought, but that sleep itself, if we turn to
God, is a part of our course; and although we slumber and are silent, still we
praise him by hope and
confidence.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the
morning</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F422</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will I seek
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By <i>the night</i> the Prophet does not
literally mean <i>sleep</i>; and this is perfectly evident from the present
clause, in which <i>night</i> is contrasted with <i>morning</i>, which denotes
continuance.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The inhabitants
of the earth will learn righteousness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We must
observe the reason assigned, when he says that "the inhabitants of the earth
learn righteousness from the judgments of God," meaning that by chastisements
men are taught to fear God.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F423</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In prosperity they forget him, and their eyes are as it were blinded by fatness;
they grow wanton and petulant, and do not submit to be under authority; and
therefore the Lord restrains their insolence, and teaches them to obey. In
short, the Prophet confesses that he and others were trained, by God's
chastisements, to yield submission to his authority, and to intrust themselves
to his guardianship; because if God do not, with uplifted arm, claim his right
to rule, no man of his own accord yields
obedience.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The wicked man will obtain
favor.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F424</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Isaiah contrasts this statement with the former. He had said that the godly,
even when they are afflicted, or see others afflicted, still rely on the love of
God, and trust in him. But now he declares, on the other hand, that the wicked
cannot be brought in any way to love God, though he endeavor, by every sort of
kindness, to draw and gain them over; and that, whatever aspect the Lord assume
towards them, they do not become better.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This
verse appears, at first view, to contradict the former, in which the Prophet
said, that the justice of God is acknowledged in the earth, when he executes his
judgments, and shews that he is the Judge, and punishes the transgressions of
men; while he says here that the wicked cannot in any way be led or persuaded to
worship God, and that they are so far from being made better by the
chastisements, that even acts of kindness make them worse. The good effect of
chastisements certainly does not appear in all; for wicked men do not at all
profit by them, as we see in Pharaoh, whom chastisements and scourges rendered
more obstinate.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;020713&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
7:13.) But although he spoke indiscriminately about "the inhabitants of the
earth," yet he strictly included none but God's elect, with whom indeed even
some hypocrites share the profit that is gained; for sometimes, though
reluctantly, they are moved by reverence for God, and are restrained by the
dread of punishments.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F425</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but as the Prophet here describes sincere repentance, by "the inhabitants of the
earth" he means only the children of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Some
view it as a question, "Shall favor be shewn to the wicked?" or, "Why should the
wicked man obtain favor?" as if the Prophet insinuated that they do not deserve
that God should deal gently with them. But I choose rather to explain it thus,
"Whatever may be the acts of kindness by which God draws the wicked, they will
never learn to act uprightly." The Prophet therefore has limited the statement
made in the former verse.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In
the land of upright actions he will deal
unjustly.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is added in order to shew more
strongly the baseness of this ingratitude. It was a sufficiently heinous offense
that they abused the acts of God's kindness, and by means of them became more
rebellious; but it is their crowning wickedness, that "they deal wickedly in the
land" which the Lord had consecrated to himself. What he now says relates to
Judea, but may be extended also to other countries in which God is now
worshipped; but at that time there was no other country on which Isaiah could
bestow that title, for in no other was there any knowledge of God.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
76:2.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Thus he calls Judea "the land of Upright
actions." I give this interpretation, because, since the Prophet employs
(</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twjkn</font><font face="Palatino">)
in the feminine gender, the word <i>upright</i> cannot apply to men.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F426</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He therefore bestows this title, because the law was there in full force,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
76:1, 2.) and that nation had been peculiarly chosen by God; and it was added,
as I have already said, in order to exhibit more strongly the ingratitude of the
nation. Some extend it indiscriminately to the whole world, because, wherever we
live, God supports us on the condition of our maintaining uprightness. This is
too far-fetched; but, since God has now spread abroad his kingdom in every
direction, wheresoever men call on his name, that is "the land of upright
actions;"
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F427</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
so that we are worthy of double condemnation, if, after having been stimulated
by benefits so numerous and so great, we do not testify our gratitude by the
practice of godliness and by good works.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he
adds, that the reprobate </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will not
behold the majesty of the Lord,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> this does not
in any degree palliate, but rather doubles their criminality; because it is base
and shameful indolence not to observe the glory of God which is openly
manifested before our eyes. The wicked are thus rendered the more inexcusable,
because, how numerous soever may be the methods by which the Lord makes known
his name, still they are blind amidst the clearest light. There is never any
lack of testimonies by which the Lord openly manifests his majesty and glory,
but, as we have formerly seen,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F428</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
few consider them. God manifests his glory not only by the ordinary works of
nature, but likewise by some astonishing miracles and demonstrations, by means
of which he gives us abundant instruction about his goodness, wisdom, and
justice. Wicked men shut their eyes, and do not observe them, though in trifling
matters they are very clear-sighted; and the Prophet now censures them severely
for this wickedness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Others think that it is a
threatening against the reprobate,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall not behold the majesty
of the Lord,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> as if they did not deserve to
obtain this view of the works of God. Though this is true, yet, as this clause
is closely connected with the former, the Prophet continues to censure the
indolence of those who do not direct their minds to the works of God, but, on
the contrary, become stupid. On this account, we ought to think it the less
wonderful that so few repent, though very many demonstrations of the
righteousness of God are openly made; for infidelity is always blind to behold
the works of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Jehovah, though thy hand is
lifted up.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is an explanation of the former
statement; for he brings forward nothing that is new, but shews more clearly
what he had formerly stated in a few words. He had already said that the wicked
"will not behold the majesty of the Lord;" and now he explains that "majesty" to
be that which is visible in the works of God. He does not send us to that hidden
majesty which is concealed from us, but leads us to the works, which he denotes
figuratively
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">metwnumikw~v</font><font face="Palatino">)
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F429</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
by the <i>hand</i>. Here he again censures the wicked, and shews that they
cannot be excused on the plea of ignorance; for, though they perceive nothing,
still the hand of God is openly visible; and it is nothing but their blind
ingratitude, or rather their voluntary indolence, that hinders them from
perceiving it. Some might plead ignorance, and allege that they did not see
these works; but the Prophet says that God's hand is "lifted up," and not merely
exerted, so that it is not only visible to a few persons, but shines
conspicuously.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall see
and be ashamed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He shews plainly that this
"beholding" is different from that of which he formerly spoke, when he said that
the wicked "do not see the glory of the Lord;" for they do see, but do not
observe or take any notice of it; but at length "they shall see," but too late,
and to their great hurt. After having long abused the patience of God, and
proved that they were obstinate and rebellious, they will at length be
constrained to acknowledge the judgments of God. Thus Cain,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010413&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
4:13,14,) Esau,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012738&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
27:38,) and others like them, who too late repented of their crimes,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
12:17,) though they fled from the face of God, yet were constrained to see that
he was their Judge. Thus, in those who despise him, God frequently, produces a
feeling of remorse, that he may display his power; but such knowledge is of no
avail to them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In this manner, therefore, the
Prophet threatens wicked men, after having accused them of blindness, in order
to shew that they have no plea of ignorance; and he forewarns them that the time
will come when they shall know with whom they have to do, and that they will
then feel that they ought not to despise that heavenly name which they now treat
as fabulous, and scorn. They shut their eyes, and act without restraint, and
make us a laughing-stock, and do not think that God will be their Judge, but
rather turn into ridicule our distresses and afflictions. Thus they look down on
us as from a lofty place, and grow more and more hardened; but at length they
will understand that the true worshippers of God have not lost their
labor.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And shall be
ashamed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In order to shew that this beholding
of the glory of God is not only of no advantage, but hurtful to them, he says
that they shall behold with <i>shame</i> the blessing of God towards believers,
in which they will have no
share.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Through their envy of
the people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This tends to shew more strongly
the severity of the punishment, that not only will they burn with "envy," when
they shall see that the children of God have been delivered from those
distresses, and have been exalted to glory, but there will likewise be added
another evil, that they will be consumed by the fire of the enemy. By "the envy
of the people," therefore, is here meant the indignation which wicked men feel
when they compare the lot of godly men with their
own.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yea, the fire of thine
enemies shall devour them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the fire</i> <i>of the
enemies</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he means that "fire" with which God
consumes his "enemies." He employs the word "fire" to denote God's vengeance;
for here it must not be taken for visible "fire" with which we are burned, nor
even for the thunderbolt alone, but is a metaphorical expression for dreadful
anguish, as we find that in many other passages Scripture denotes by this term,
God's severest vengeance.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;053222&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
32:22;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;182026&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
20:26, 22:20.) No language indeed can sufficiently express this anguish. Yet I
do not object to the suggestion, that the Prophet alludes to the destruction of
Sodom and Gomorrah.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011924&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Jehovah, thou wilt ordain peace
for us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This statement tends to the consolation
of the godly, as if he had said, "We shall see what will be the end of the
wicked; for thou wilt prevent them from sharing with thy children, and wilt take
them away as enemies by fire, but we shall be happy." The Hebrew verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tp&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>shaphath</i>,) which signifies "to ordain," has the same import as the word
"establish;" as if he had said, "Thou wilt prepare peace for us in uninterrupted
succession:" for the wicked also enjoy peace, but not of long duration; but our
peace is fixed on the Lord, and has a firm foundation, and never comes to an
end. By the word <i>peace</i> he means perfect happiness. Hence infer, that the
children of God alone, who rest on him, are happy; for the life of the wicked,
to whatever extent it may abound in pleasures and luxuries, when everything
proceeds to their wish, is most miserable. There is therefore no solid
foundation for peace but in God's fatherly
love.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All our
works.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By <i>works</i> he means all the
blessings which the Lord bestows on those who believe in him; as if he had said,
"Transactions, business, actions," and everything included in the French phrase
<i>nos affaires</i>, or in the corresponding English phrase <i>our</i>
<i>affairs</i>. Accordingly, those who have quoted this passage for the purpose
of overturning free-will have not understood the Prophet's meaning. It is
undoubtedly true that God alone does what is good in us, and that all the good
actions which men perform are from his Spirit. But here the Prophet merely shews
that we have obtained from the hand of God all the good things which we enjoy;
and hence he infers that his kindness will not cease till we shall have obtained
perfect happiness. Now, since God is the author of all good things, we ought
chiefly to consider those which hold the first and highest place; for if we
ought to acknowledge that we have received from God those things by which we
support this life, much more those which belong to the salvation of the soul.
If, therefore, we ought to acknowledge his kindness in small matters, how much
more ought we to acknowledge it in matters of the greatest importance and value?
But there is no reason why we should bring forward this passage against the
Papists; for they might easily evade it, and we have a great number of other
passages exceedingly conclusive.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In this
passage, therefore, the Prophet appears to exhort the godly to testify their
gratitude; for he bids them declare the acts of God's kindness, so as to
acknowledge that they are indebted to him for everything which they possess; and
this contains a profitable doctrine, namely, that from past events and benefits
received, the godly reason even as to God's future kindness, and infer that he
will also take care of them for the future. Having therefore experienced God's
kindness, let us also learn to hope for the future; and since he hath shewn
himself to be so kind and bountiful, let us steadfastly fix our hearts in the
hope of future assistance.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This example has been
followed by all the saints, and in this way they have strengthened their faith.
Thus David says, "Thou wilt not despise the work of thy hands."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D808&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;500106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
1:6.) Jacob also says, "I am less than the compassions and the truth which thou
hast shewn to thy servant; but thou saidst, I will surely do thee good."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;013210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
32:10,12.) God is not like men, to be capable of being wearied by doing good, or
exhausted by giving largely; and therefore the more numerous the benefits with
which he has loaded us, so much the more ought our faith to be strengthened and
increased.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>

composed in order to refresh the hearts of believers, who were to be cruelly
banished from that land which was a figure of eternal happiness, that, having
been deprived of sacrifices and holy assemblies, and almost of every
consolation, crushed by the heavy yoke of the Babylonians, banished from their
country, loaded with reproach and sore afflictions, they might direct their
groanings to God, in order to seek relief. He speaks, therefore, in the name of

have had dominion over us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Not without cause do
they complain that they are placed under a different dominion from that of God,
for he had received them under his sole guardianship. Hence it follows that, if
they had not been estranged from him, they would not have endured so hard a lot
as to be exposed to the tyranny and caprice of enemies. It may be thought that
the government of all princes is "besides God," or different from that of God,
even though they govern in his name. But the Prophet does not speak of those who
govern for our benefit, but of those who are opposed to true worship and to holy
doctrine. David was indeed a ruler who exercised dominion separate from that of
God, but at the same time he was a genuine servant of God for the general
advantage of the whole people; and therefore he maintained the true religion,
which those rulers wished altogether to overthrow. Most justly did it befall the
Jews, that, in consequence of having refused to obey God, who treated them with
the greatest kindness, they were subjected to the tyranny of wicked
men.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There is an implied contrast between God
and the pious kings who governed the people in his name and by his authority,
and the tyrants who oppressed them by governing with most unjust laws. This will
be made more evident by a similar passage in Ezekiel, "I gave them," says God,
"good laws, by which they might live; but because they did not execute my
judgments, and despised my statutes, and profaned my Sabbaths, and cast their
eyes upon the idols of their fathers, for this reason I gave them statutes that
were not good, and judgments by which they could not live."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;262011&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
20:11, 24, 25.) Since they might formerly, through the blessing of God, have
been prosperous and happy, if they had obeyed his word, the prophet Ezekiel
threatens that they will be subjected to tyrants who will compel them to obey
their cruel enactments, and that without profit or reward. Isaiah now deplores a
similar calamity. "When the Lord ruled over us, we could not be satisfied with
our lot, and now we are compelled to endure severe tyranny and suffer the just
punishment of our wickedness." The same complaint may be made by believers who
live under the Papacy, or who in any way are compelled, by unjust laws, to
observe superstition; for they are subject to a government which is "besides
God," or different from that of God, and endure bondage worse than barbarous,
which not only fetters their bodies, but conducts their souls to torture and
slaughter.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In thee
only.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This clause appears to be contrasted with
the former to this effect, "Although irreligious men wish to withdraw from thy
dominion, yet we will continue under it; for we are fully convinced that we are
thine." But we may draw from it more abundant instruction, that, although the
feeling of the flesh pronounces that those who are cruelly oppressed by enemies
have been forsaken by God, and laid open to be a prey, yet the Jews do not cease
to boast in God when they do not perceive that he is near them; for the mere
remembrance of his name supports them, and gently cherishes their hope. There is
thus a very emphatic contrast between "the remembrance of the name of God" and
the immediate experience of his grace; for steadfastly to embrace God, even
though he is absent, is a proof of uncommon
excellence.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Others render it,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In thee and in thy
name</i></font><font face="Palatino">; but the word <i>and</i> is not in the
passage. There is here exhibited to us consolation, which is great and highly
necessary in these times, when the base ingratitude of men, by shaking off the
yoke of God, has brought down upon itself a most cruel tyranny; and we need not
wonder if we already see it abound in many places in which men call on the name
of God. Yet the godly ought not to faint on this account, provided that they
support themselves by this consolation, that God never entirely forsakes those
who find abundant consolation in the remembrance of his name. But at the same
time it is necessary to testify this faith, so as to choose to die a thousand
times rather than depart from God by profaning his name; for when any one goes
astray through the fear of men, it is certain that he never has truly tasted the
sweetness of the name of God. So long, therefore, as we freely enjoy the word,
let us be diligently employed in it, so that, when necessity shall demand it, we
may be armed, and that it may not appear that we have indulged at our ease in
idle speculation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>

The Prophet again speaks of the unhappy end of the wicked, whose prosperity
often agitates and vexes us, as we read in the Psalms of David.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
37:1, 73:3, 17.) That our eyes may not be dazzled by the present appearances of
things, he foretells that their end will be very miserable. Others interpret
this passage as relating to believers, who appear to die without any hope of a
resurrection; but unquestionably he speaks of the reprobate, and this will be
still more evident from an opposite statement which he makes at the nineteenth
verse. There is a contrast between the resurrection of good men and wicked men,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F431</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
between whom there would be little difference, were it not evident that the
latter are sentenced to eternal death, and that the former will receive a
blessed and everlasting life: and not only does eternal death await the wicked,
but all the sufferings which they endure in this world are the commencement of
everlasting destruction; for they cannot be soothed by any consolation, and they
feel that God is their
enemy.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The slain shall not

added for the sake of explanation; for it assigns the reason why the reprobate

In the wrath of God they have nothing to look for but death and
ruin.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast added to the nation.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">This verse is explained in various ways. Some
think that the Prophet here declares that the godly are not merely oppressed by
one kind of affliction, but are plunged, as it were, into the lowest misery, and
that they see no end of their distresses. Others explain it simply to mean, "O
Lord, thou hast bestowed on thy nation various blessings," and think that the
Prophet mentions the blessings which god bestowed on his people in various ways,
as if he had said, "The people have experienced, not only in one instance, but
in innumerable ways, the Lord's kindness and
bounty."</font><br><font face="Palatino">But when I attend to what follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast
enlarged</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, "Thou hast extended thy
kingdom, which formerly was confined within narrow limits," I choose rather to
view the two statements as closely connected; for the latter clause is an
interpretation of the former. Besides, it agrees well with what follows,
that</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> God is
glorified</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for we know that in nothing does the
glory of God shine more conspicuously than in the increase of the Church. It is
as if he had said, "Thou hadst formerly a small people, but thou hast multiplied
and increased it;" for the Gentiles were admitted and joined to the Jews on
condition that they should be united into one people. Thus the Lord added a vast
multitude, for the children of Abraham were called out of all
nations.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We must therefore supply, not "Thou
hast added blessings," but "Thou hast added a greater number;" and the meaning
is, "O Lord, thou wast not satisfied with that small number, and hast gathered
for thyself out of all nations an innumerable people." This relates to the
kingdom of Christ, which has been spread through the whole world by the
preaching of the gospel; and in this passage the Prophet speaks highly of this
wide extension, and expresses it by the phrase,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast
enlarged</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This mode of expression is not at
variance with the ordinary way of speaking, when an enlargement of a kingdom or
of territories is expressed. And yet the Prophet does not mean that the land was
enlarged, but that, by spreading the worship of God on all sides, mutual
intercourse produced larger space and greater freedom of habitation; for
contentions had the effect of narrowing it.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F435</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
We have here a promise of the calling of the Gentiles, which must have greatly
comforted godly men during that banishment and miserable dispersion of the
Church, so that, although they saw it to be amazingly weakened and diminished,
still they were convinced that it would be increased in such a manner that not
only would they become innumerable, but foreign and distant nations would be
added to
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
O Jehovah, in tribulation they have visited
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This might be explained as relating to
hypocrites, who never flee to God but when they have been constrained by
distresses and afflictions. But since the Lord instructs believers also by
chastisements, as the Prophet formerly shewed, (verses 8 and 9,) I choose rather
to refer it simply to them, that not only they may know that God has justly
punished them, but that the bitterness of the afflictions may likewise be
sweetened by the good result of the chastisement, and that they may be better
instructed in the fear of the Lord, and may profit more and more every day.
Isaiah therefore speaks in the person of the Church, that whenever godly men
read this statement, they might acknowledge that amidst their distresses and
afflictions they were nearer to God than when they enjoyed prosperity, by means
of which almost always (such is the depravity of our nature) we become
excessively proud and insolent. On this account we must be curbed and tamed by
chastisements; and this thought will soften the harshness of punishments, and
make us less ready to shrink from them if we think that they are profitable to
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They poured out a
prayer.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;jl</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>lachash</i>)
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F436</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
signifies a <i>muttering</i>. This word therefore must not be taken for a prayer
pronounced in words,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F437</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but for that which indicates that the heart is wrung with sore pains, as those
who are tortured by extreme anguish can hardly speak or express the feelings of
their hearts. It therefore denotes, that calling upon God which is sincere and
free from all hypocrisy; such as men will aim at when in sore affliction they
utter groans as expressive of intense pain. In prosperity men speak with open
mouths; but when they are cast down by adversity, they hardly venture to mutter,
and express their feelings with the heart rather than with the tongue. Hence
arise those unutterable groans of which Paul speaks.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450826&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:26.) It is in reference to the godly, therefore, that Paul makes this
declaration, and to them must this doctrine be limited; for wicked men, although
some lamentations are extorted from them by pain, become more hardened and more
and more obstinate and rebellious.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As a woman with
child.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here two things ought chiefly to be
remarked. First, he compares believers to women in labor, who, we know, endure
exquisite pain; and, accordingly, he says that their anguish breaks out into
loud and violent cries. Hence we infer that the Prophet does not only speak of
that sorrow which arises from outward distresses and annoyances, but rather
describes that dreadful anguish by which the hearts of the godly are sorely and
dreadfully tormented, when they perceive that God is angry with them, and when
their consciences reprove them. There is no bodily pain so acute that it can be
compared to that anguish, and this is plainly expressed by the phrase <i>in
thy</i> <i>sight</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have as it were brought forth
wind.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The second thing to be remarked is, that
he goes beyond the limit of the metaphor; for when there is no end to their
distresses, the condition of the godly is worse than that of women in labor,
who, as soon as they are free from their pains, break out into joy at the sight
of what they have brought forth,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431621&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
16:21,) and forget all their sorrows. The godly, on the other hand, he tells us,
are continually bringing forth; for new troubles and anxieties constantly await
them, and when they think that the birth is at hand, they bring forth nothing
but anguish. That is what he means by
<i>wind,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
F438</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> namely, that there is no removal or
abatement of pain; and immediately afterwards he thus explains it,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Salvations have not been wrought
for the land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F439</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that is, we have not beheld any
deliverance.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the
inhabitants of the world have not fallen.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">Lbw
wlpy</font><font face="Palatino"> (<i>ubal yippelu</i>,) that is,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>have not
fallen</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lpn</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>naphal</i>) signifies "to fall." Others explain it "to dwell." If we take it
in that sense, the meaning Will be, "The Jews shall not dwell," that is, they
shall not return to their own land the inhabitants who possess it shall not
perish. But if we follow the ordinary interpretation, we must view it as
referring to the wicked. "The inhabitants of the world annoy us and do not fall;
everything goes on prosperously with them."</font><br><font face="Palatino">So
long as the wicked flourish, the children of God must be unhappy, and become
like women in labor; and this condition must be quietly endured by us, if we
wish to have a place in the Church of God. It is, indeed, the common lot of all
to endure numerous and endless afflictions; and hence comes the old proverb, "It
is happy not to be born, or, when born, immediately to depart out of life." But
we see that the godly are visited with sore anguish and very heavy afflictions
beyond others; for in this manner God wishes to try their faith, that, after
having laid aside their desires and forsaken the world, they may serve him.
Since, therefore, the Lord has a peculiar care of them, he must chastise them,
while he permits wicked men to indulge in unbounded
licentiousness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here we are also reminded that
we must endure not merely one or another calamity, and must not imagine that,
when we have endured some afflictions, there are none in reserve for us; for we
ought always to be prepared to endure new ones. When God begins to chastise his
people, he does not immediately cease. We shall "bring forth wind" when we think
that the birth is at hand; other calamities will break out, and we shall be
continually attacked by additional sorrows. We must therefore maintain this
warfare so long as it shall please God to employ us in it. Accordingly, we shall
follow the ordinary interpretation, <i>have not</i> <i>fallen</i>; for, as the
Lord cheers his people, when he manifests to them his salvation and punishes the
wicked, so he gives them occasion to groan, so long as they behold their enemies
placed in a lofty position and exercising high authority. And if the Lord in
this manner tried his Church in former times, we need not wonder that we
experience the same thing in the present day.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the inhabitants of the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he means heathens and irreligious men;
for he contrasts the rest of the world with Judea, which he formerly called, by
way of eminence, (</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kat j
ejxoch&lt;n</font><font face="Palatino">,) <i>the land</i>, and mentions its
inhabitants
apart.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>Thy dead men shall live.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Isaiah
continues the same consolation, and addresses his discourse to God, thus shewing
that there is nothing better for us than to bring our thoughts to meet in God,
whenever we must struggle with temptations; for there is nothing more dangerous
than to wander in our thoughts, and to give way to them, since they can do
nothing else than toss us up and down and drive us into error. Nothing therefore
is safer for us than to betake ourselves to God, on whom alone our hearts can
rest; for otherwise we shall meet with many things that tend to shake our faith.
The general meaning is, that as God guards believers, though they are like "dead
men," yet they "shall live" amidst death itself, or shall rise again after their
decease.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But it may be asked, of what time does
Isaiah speak? For many interpret this passage as relating to the last
resurrection. The Jews refer it to Messiah's kingdom, but they are mistaken in
thinking that it is immediately fulfilled by the Messiah's first coming.
Christians are also mistaken in limiting it to the last judgment; for the
Prophet includes the whole reign of Christ from the beginning to the end, since
the hope of living, as we shall immediately see, goes beyond this world. Now, in
order to understand more fully the whole of the Prophet's meaning, we ought
first to consider that life is promised, not indiscriminately, but only to
"God's dead men; " and he speaks of believers who die in the Lord, and whom he
protects by his power. We know that "God is the God of the living, and not of
the dead."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402232&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
22:32.) Accordingly, if we are God's people, we shall undoubtedly live; but in
the meantime we must differ in no respect from dead men, for "our life is
hidden,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;510303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
3:3,) and we do not yet see those things for which we hope.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450823&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:23, 24.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">So then he speaks simply of the dead,
that is, of the condition of believers, who lie in the shadow of death on
account of various afflictions which they must continually endure. Hence it is
evident, that this must not be limited to the last resurrection; for, on the
contrary, we say that the reprobate, even while they live, are dead, because
they do not taste God's fatherly kindness, in which life consists, and therefore
perish in their brutal stupidity. But believers, by fleeing to God, obtain life
in the midst of afflictions, and even in death itself; but because they have in
prospect that day of the resurrection, they are not said literally to live till
that day when they shall be free from all pain and corruption, and shall obtain
perfect life; and, indeed, Paul justly argues, that it would be a subversion of
order, were they to enjoy life till the appearance of Christ, who is the source
of their life.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;510303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
3:3, 4.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Thus we have said that Isaiah includes
the whole reign of Christ; for, although we begin to receive the fruit of this
consolation when we are admitted into the Church, yet we shall not enjoy it
fully till that last day of the resurrection is come, when all things shall be
most completely restored; and on this account also it is called "the day of
restitution."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;440321&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
3:21.) The only remedy for soothing the grief of the godly is, to cast their
eyes on the result, by which God distinguishes them from the reprobate. As death
naturally destroys all the children of Adam, so all the miseries to which they
are liable are forerunners of death, and therefore their life is nothing else
than mortality. But because the curse of God, through the kindness of Christ, is
abolished, both in the beginning and in the end of death, all who are engrafted
into Christ are justly said to live in dying; for to them all that is evil is
the instrument of good.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450828&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:28.) Hence it follows, that out of the depths of death they always come forth
conquerors till they are perfectly united to their Head; and therefore, in order
that we may be reckoned among "God's dead men," whose life he faithfully guards,
we must rise above nature. This is more fully expressed by the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlbn</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>nebelah</i>,) or <i>dead
body</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My dead body, they
shall arise.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As if he had said, "The
long-continued putrefaction, by which they appear to be consumed, will not
hinder the power of God from causing them to rise again entire." So far as
relates to the phrase, some render it, "With my dead body." Others explain it,
"Who are my dead body." Others supply the particle of comparison, "Like as my
dead body; " but as the meaning is most fully brought out if, without adding or
changing anything, we take up simply what the words mean, I choose to view them
as standing in immediate connection. At least, this word is inserted for the
express purpose that the Prophet may join himself to the whole Church, and thus
may reckon himself in the number of "God's dead men" in the hope of the
resurrection.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F440</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">As
to his mentioning himself in particular, he does so for the sake of more fully
confirming this doctrine; for thus he testifies his sincerity, and shews that
this confession is the result of faith, according to that saying, "I believed,
therefore I spake."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
116:10;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470413&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 4:13.) But for this, irreligious men might discourse concerning the
mercy of God and eternal life, though they had no sincere belief of them; for
even Balaam knew that he spoke what was true, and yet he derived no benefit from
his predictions.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;042319&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
23:19; 24:13.) Very differently does the Prophet speak in this passage; for he
professes to belong to the number of those who shall obtain life, and then
declares that he willingly endures all the troubles and calamities by which the
Lord humbles and slays him, and that he chooses rather to endure them than to
flourish along with the wicked. In this manner he testifies, that he does not
speak of things unknown, or in which he has no concern, but of those things
which he has learned by actual experience; and shews that his confidence is so
great that he willingly ranks himself in the number of those "dead bodies"
which, he firmly believes, will be restored to life, and therefore chooses to be
a dead body, and to be so reckoned, provided that he be accounted a member of
the Church, rather than to enjoy life in a state of separation from the
Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This gives greater force to his
doctrine, and he contrasts it with the statement which he formerly made (verse
14) about wicked men, <i>they shall not live</i>; for the hope of rising again
is taken from them. If it be objected, that resurrection will be common not only
to believers but also to the reprobate, the answer is easy; for Isaiah does not
speak merely of the resurrection, but of the happiness which believers will
enjoy. Wicked men will indeed rise again, but it will be to eternal destruction;
and therefore the resurrection will bring ruin to them, while it will bring
salvation and glory to
believers.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Awake and sing, ye
inhabitants of the dust.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He gives the name,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>inhabitants of the
dust</i></font><font face="Palatino">, to believers, who are humbled under the
cross and afflictions, and who even during their life keep death constantly
before their eyes. It is true that they enjoy God's blessings in this life;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F441</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but by this metaphor Isaiah declares that their condition is miserable, because
they bear the image of death; for "the outward man" must be subdued and
weakened, till it utterly decay, "that the inward man may be renewed."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470416&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 4:16.) We must therefore be willing to be humbled, and to lie down
in the dust, if we wish to share in this
consolation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Accordingly, he bids the dead men
"awake and sing," which appears to be very inconsistent with their condition;
for among them there is nothing but mournful silence.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;190605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
6:5; 88:11.) He thus draws a clear distinction between God's elect, whom the
corruption of the grave and the "habitation in the dust" will not deprive of
that heavenly vigor by which they shall rise again, and the reprobate, who,
separated from God the source of life, and from Christ, fade away even while
they live, till they are wholly swallowed up by
death.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thy dew is the dew
of herbs.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F442</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He now promises "the dew of herbs," and thus illustrates this doctrine by an
elegant and appropriate comparison. We know that <i>herbs</i>, and especially
those of the meadows, are dried up in winter, so that they appear to be wholly
dead, and, to outward appearance, no other judgment could be formed respecting
them; yet the roots are concealed beneath, which, when they have imbibed the
<i>dew</i> at the return of spring, put forth their vigor, so that <i>herbs</i>
which formerly were dry and withered, grow green again. In this manner will the
nation regain its former vigor after having been plentifully watered with the
<i>dew</i> of the grace of God, though formerly it appeared to be altogether
withered and decayed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Such comparisons, drawn
from well-known objects, have great influence in producing conviction. If
"herbs" watered by "dew" revive, why shall not we also revive when watered by
the grace of God? Why shall not our bodies, though dead and rotten, revive? Does
not God take more care of us than of herbs? And is not the power of the Spirit
greater than that of "dew?" Paul employs a similar argument in writing to the
Corinthians, when he treats of the resurrection; but as he applies his
comparison to a different purpose, I think it better to leave it for the
present, lest we should confound the two passages. It is enough if we understand
the plain meaning of the
Prophet.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the earth shall
cast out the dead.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Others render the clause in
the second person, "Thou wilt lay low the land of giants,"
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F443</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
or "Thou wilt lay low the giants on the earth." I do not disapprove of this
interpretation, for the words admit of that meaning; but the former appears to
agree better with the scope of the passage, though it makes little difference as
to the substance of the doctrine. These words must relate to that consolation of
which we have formerly spoken.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come, my
people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In this verse he exhorts the children
of God to exercise patience, to shut themselves up, and to bear with moderation
their troubles and afflictions, and to stand unmoved in opposition to the fierce
tempests which seemed likely to overwhelm them. This exhortation was highly
necessary; for the lamentable state to which the nation was afterwards reduced
was, to outward appearance, very inconsistent with that promise. The Prophet,
therefore, when the people are distressed and know not where to go, takes them,
as it were, by the hand, and conducts them to some retired spot, where they may
hide themselves in safety till the storms and tempests are abated. When he calls
them "his own people," he speaks in the name of God, and not in his
own.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Enter into thy
chamber.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By <i>chamber</i> he means calmness
and composure of mind, by which we encourage and strengthen our hearts with firm
belief, and calmly wait for the Lord, as Habakkuk, after having foretold the
calamities which were about to fall on the Jews, says that he will go up "to his
watch-tower," that is, to a place of safety, in which he may patiently and
silently await the result.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;350201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
2:1.) Isaiah gives a similar injunction in this passage, that the godly, when
they see that they are attacked by various storms which they are unable to
resist, should shut themselves up in a "chamber," or some place of
retirement.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shut thy doors
behind thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As it would not be enough that we
should once be fortified against the fierce attacks of tempests, he bids us also
"shut the doors." This relates to steadfastness; as if he enjoined us to take
good heed not to leave any chink open for the devil; for he will easily break
through and penetrate into our hearts, if the smallest entrance be allowed
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hide thyself for a little
moment.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When he bids them "hide" or "conceal"
themselves, he means that it will be a very safe refuge for believers, if they
are courageous and patiently wait for the Lord; for though we must boldly and
valiantly maintain the contest, yet since the power of God is displayed in our
weakness,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;471209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 12:9,) there is nothing better for us than to take refuge, with all
humility, under God's wings, that they who tremble may be placed by him in
perfect safety.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Again, because we are naturally
rash, and hurried away by impatience, when we do not see that the Lord's
assistance is immediate, on this account he says that these storms are
"momentary."
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F444</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
True, we must continually struggle with afflictions, and, so long as we live,
must not hope to see an end of them; and, consequently, the afflictions are, in
our opinion, of very long duration. But if we compare them with that eternity,
in which we shall possess immortal joys, it will be but "a very little moment."
In like manner, Paul also shews that the light and momentary afflictions which
we endure in this life, ought not to be compared to that weight of eternal glory
which we expect to receive.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 4:17;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450818&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:18.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Till the indignation
pass over.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By adding this he intends to remove
all doubt from believers, as if he promised that they would quickly be
delivered. I interpret "indignation" as meaning simply the affliction which
proceeds from the Lord's anger. Others refer it to enemies; and I do not object
to that interpretation, but prefer the former; for we see that the prophets
earnestly teach that no evil happens to us that does not come from the hand of
God, who does not inflict them on us without good reason, but when he has been
provoked by our iniquities and transgressions.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;300306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Amos
3:6.) We are thus reminded that God's wrath against the Church will not last
always, but that, like storms and tempests, it will come to an end, and on this
account believers endure it more patiently. Hence it is said elsewhere,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;330709&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Micah
7:9,) "I will bear the Lord's wrath;" for they know that he chastises them for
their salvation. He introduces the Lord speaking, as I mentioned a little
before, that his exhortation may have greater
authority.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For, behold, Jehovah cometh out
of his place.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is a very grievous temptation
to the godly, when they see that the wicked exercise their rage without being
punished, and that God does not restrain them; for they look upon themselves as
forsaken by him. Isaiah therefore meets this temptation, and shews that the
Lord, though he keep himself out of view for a time, will in due season gird
himself for yielding assistance, and for revenging the injuries which his people
have received.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By the word <i>cometh out</i>, he
describes God stretching out his hand to his people in such a manner as if it
had formerly been concealed, because the saints did not perceive his aid. For
this reason he says, that the Lord "cometh out," and that he appears in public
to yield assistance and exercise judgment, as if he had formerly dwelt like a
private person at home. But perhaps there is an allusion to the sanctuary; and
this mode of expression occurs frequently in the prophets.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;330101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Micah
1:3;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;350313&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
3:13;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;381403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
14:3.) Though heathen nations despised the ark of the covenant which was laid up
in a place little renowned, yet believers knew, by communications of power and
grace which they quickly obtained, that it was not in vain or to no purpose that
they called on God in that holy place. Yet this principle always holds good,
that, though unbelievers ridicule the temple as some mean hut, still God will
"come forth" from it at his own time, that the whole world may know that he is
the protector of his people</font><br><font face="Palatino">This meaning is more
appropriate than if we were to interpret God's <i>place</i> to mean heaven, from
which he "cometh forth;" for Isaiah intended to express something more. When the
prophets mention heaven, they exhibit to us the majesty and glory of God; but
here he refers to our senses, that is, when we see that God, who formerly
appeared to remain concealed and to be at rest, gives us assistance. He employs
the demonstrative particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnh</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>hinneh</i>,) <i>behold</i>, and the participle of the present tense
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">axy</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>yotze</i>,) <i>coming forth</i>, in order to express certainty, and that
believers may not be displeased at bridling their feelings till his
coming.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To visit the
iniquity.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is to the same purport with what
goes before; for it would have been inconsistent with the nature of God, who is
the judge of the world, to allow the wicked freely to indulge in sin without
being punished. The word <i>visit</i> contains a well-known metaphor; because,
so long as God delays or suspends his judgments, we think that he sees nothing,
or that he has turned away his eyes. There is emphasis, also, in the phrase
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wyl[</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>gnalaiv</i>,) <i>upon him</i>; as it is frequently said that the wicked are
taken in "the snares which they have laid,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;190916&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
9:16,) or "in the pit which they have digged."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;195706&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
57:6.) The meaning therefore is, that all the injuries inflicted will fall on
the heads of those who were the authors of
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The earth also shall
disclose her blood.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F445</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This also is highly emphatic. When innocent blood is shed and trodden under foot
by wicked men, the earth drinks it up, and as it were receives it into her
bosom; and, in the meantime, the death of the godly appears to be forgotten, and
to be blotted out for ever from remembrance, so that it shall never come to be
beheld even by God himself. Men indeed think so, but God makes a widely
different declaration; for he declares, that those murderers will one day be
"disclosed" and brought into judgment.</font><br><font face="Palatino">On this
account he calls it "the blood, or bloods, of the earth," which the earth has
drunk up; and in like manner it is said, that "the earth opened her mouth" when
the blood of Abel was shed.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
4:11.) In that passage the Lord represents in strong terms the aggravation of
that guilt, by saying, that the earth was polluted with that blood, and
therefore he shews how "precious in his sight is the death of the saints,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B615&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
116:15,) how great is the care which he takes of them, and that at length he
will not permit their death to pass unpunished. The earth itself will take up
arms to avenge the murders and cruelties which the godly have endured from
tyrants and enemies of the truth; and not a drop of blood has been shed of which
they will not have to render an account. We ought therefore to call to
remembrance this consolation, and to keep it constantly before our eyes, when
the wicked slay, mock, and ridicule us, and inflict upon us every kind of
outrage and cruelty. God will at length make known that the cry of innocent
blood has not been uttered in vain; for he never can forget his own people.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that
day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here the Prophet speaks in general of the
judgment of God, and thus includes the whole of Satan's kingdom. Having formerly
spoken of the vengeance of God to be displayed against tyrants and wicked men
who have shed innocent blood, he now proceeds farther, and publishes the
proclamation of this
vengeance.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On
leviathan.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The word "leviathan" is variously
interpreted; but in general it simply denotes either a large serpent, or whales
and sea-fishes, which approach to the character of monsters on account of their
huge size.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F446</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
A1though this description applies to the king of Egypt, yet under one class he
intended also to include the other enemies of the Church. For my own part, I
have no doubt that he speaks allegorically of Satan and of his whole kingdom,
describing him under the figure of some monstrous animal, and at the same time
glancing at the crafty wiles by which he glosses over his mischievous designs.
In this manner he intended to meet many doubts by which we are continually
assailed, when God declares that he will assist us, and when we experience, on
the other hand, the strength, craft, and deceitfulness of Satan. Wonderful are
the stratagems with which he comes prepared for doing mischief, and dreadful the
cruelty which he exercises against the children of God. But the Prophet shews
that all this will not prevent the Lord from destroying and overthrowing this
kingdom. It is indeed certain that this passage does not relate to Satan
himself, but to his agents or instruments,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F447</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
by which he governs his kingdom and annoys the Church of God. Now, though this
kingdom is defended by innumerable cunning devices, and is astonishingly
powerful, yet the Lord will destroy it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">To
convince us of this, the Prophet contrasts with it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Lord's sword, hard, and
great, and strong,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> by which he will easily slay
an enemy that is both strong and crafty. It ought therefore to be observed, that
we have continually to do with Satan as with some wild beast, and that the world
is the sea in which we sail. We are beset by various wild beasts, which endeavor
to upset our ship and sink us to the bottom; and we have no means of defending
ourselves and resisting them, if the Lord do not aid us. Accordingly, by this
description the Prophet intended to describe the greatness of the danger which
threatens us from enemies so powerful and so full of rage and of cunning
devices. We should quickly be reduced to the lowest extremity, and should be
utterly ruined, did not God oppose and meet them with his invincible power; for
by his sword alone can this pernicious kingdom of Satan be
destroyed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But we must observe what he says in
the beginning of the verse, <i>In</i> <i>that day</i>. It means that Satan is
permitted, for some time, to strengthen and defend his kingdom, but that it will
at length be destroyed; as Paul also declares, "God will quickly bruise Satan
under your feet."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451620&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
16:20.) By this promise he shews that the time for war is not yet ended, and
that we must fight bravely till that enemy be subdued, who, though he has been a
hundred times vanquished, ceases not to renew the warfare. We must therefore
fight with him continually, and must resist the violent attacks which he makes
upon us; but, in order that we may not be discouraged, we must keep our eye on
that day when his strong arm shall be
broken.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On leviathan the
piercing serpent, and on leviathan the crooked
serpent.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The epithets applied to "leviathan"
describe, on the one hand, his tricks and wiles, and, on the other hand, his
open violence; but at the same time intimate that he is endued with invincible
power. Since
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jyrb</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>bariach</i>) signifies a crowbar, that word denotes metaphorically the power
of piercing, either on account of venomous bites or on account of open violence.
The second name,!
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wtlq[</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>gnakallathon</i>,) is derived from the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lq[</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>gnakal</i>,) <i>to bend</i>; and hence it comes to be applied to crooked and
tortuous foldings.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>

redness.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F448</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He now shews that all this will promote the salvation of the Church; for the
Lord attends to the interests of his people, whom he has taken under his
guardianship and protection. In order, therefore, that the Church may be
restored, Satan and all his kingdom shall be utterly destroyed. The object of
all the vengeance which God takes on his enemies is to shew that he takes care
of the Church; and although in this passage the Prophet does not name the
Church, he shews plainly enough that he addresses her in this
congratulation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This figure conveys the meaning
even more strongly than if he had spoken expressly of the people of Israel; for
since the whole excellence of a vineyard depends partly on the soil in which it
is planted, and partly on diligent cultivation, if the Church of God is a
vineyard, we infer that its excellence is owing to nothing else than the
undeserved favor of God and the uninterrupted continuance of his kindness. The
same metaphor expresses also God's astonishing love towards the Church, of which
we spoke largely under the fifth chapter.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F449</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">He
calls it </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a vineyard of
redness</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, very excellent; for in
Scripture, if we compare various passages, "red wine" denotes excellence. He
says that this song may at that time be sung in the Church, and foretells that,
though it would in the mean time be reduced to fearful ruin, and would lie
desolate and waste, yet that afterwards it will be restored in such a manner as
to yield fruit plentifully, and that this will furnish abundant materials for
singing.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
I Jehovah keep it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here the Lord asserts his
care and diligence in dressing and guarding the vine, as if he had said, that he
left nothing undone that belonged to the duty of a provident and industrious
householder. Not only does he testify what he will do, when the time for
gladness and congratulation shall arrive, but he relates the blessings which the
Jews had already received, that their hope for the future may be increased. Yet
we must supply an implied contrast with the intermediate period, during which
God appeared to have laid aside all care of it, so that at that time it differed
little from a wilderness. This then is the reason why the Lord's vineyard was
plundered and laid waste; it was because the Lord forsook it, and gave it up as
a prey to the enemy. Hence we infer that our condition will be ruined as soon as
the Lord has departed from us; and if he assist, everything will go
well.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will water it every
moment.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He next mentions two instances of his
diligence, that he "will water it every moment," and will defend it against the
attacks of robbers and cattle and other annoyances. These are the two things
chiefly required in preserving a vineyard, cultivation and protection. Under the
word <i>water</i> he includes all that is necessary for cultivation, and
promises that he will neglect nothing that can carry it forward. But protection
must likewise be added; for it will be to no purpose to have cultivated a
vineyard with vast toil, if robbers and cattle break in and destroy it. The
Lord, therefore, promises that he will grant protection, and will not permit it
to suffer damage, that the fruits may ripen well, and may be gathered in due
season. Though the vine may suffer many attacks, and though enemies and wild
beasts may assail it with great violence, God declares that he will interpose to
preserve it unhurt and free from all danger. Moreover, since he names a fixed
day for singing this song, let us remember that, if at any time he cease to
assist us, we ought not entirely to cast away hope; and therefore, if he permit
us to be harassed and plundered for a time, still he will at length shew that he
has not cast away all care of us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fury is not in
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This verse contains excellent consolation;
for it expresses the incredible warmth of love which the Lord bears towards his
people, though they are of a wicked and rebellious disposition. God assumes, as
we shall see, the character of a father who is grievously offended, and who,
while he is offended at his son, still more pities him, and is naturally
inclined to exercise compassion, because the warmth of his love rises above his
anger. In short, he shews that he cannot hate his elect so as not to bear
fatherly kindness towards them, even while he visits them with very severe
punishments.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Scripture represents God to us in
various ways. Sometimes it exhibits him as burning with indignation, and having
a terrific aspect, and sometimes as shewing nothing but gentleness and mercy;
and the reason of this diversity is, that we are not all capable of enjoying his
goodness. Thus he is constrained to be perverse towards the perverse, and holy
towards the holy, as David describes him.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191825&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
18:25.) He shews himself to us what we suffer him to be, for by our
rebelliousness we drive him to severity.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet
here the Prophet does not speak of all indiscriminately, but only of the Church,
whose transgressions he chastises, and whose iniquities he punishes, in such a
manner as not to lay aside a father's affection. This statement must therefore
be limited to the Church, so as to denote the relation between God and his
chosen people, to whom he cannot manifest himself otherwise than as a Father,
while he burns with rage against the reprobate. Thus we see how great is the
consolation that is here given; for if we know that God has called us, we may
justly conclude that he is not angry with us, and that, having embraced us with
a firm and enduring regard, it is impossible that he shall ever deprive us of
it. It is indeed certain that at that time God hated many persons who belonged
to that nation; but, with respect to their adoption, he declares that he loved
them. Now, the more kindly and tenderly that God loved them, so much the more
they who provoked his anger by their wickedness were without excuse. This
circumstance is undoubtedly intended to aggravate their guilt, that their
wickedness constrains him, in some measure, to change his disposition towards
them; for, having formerly spoken of his gentleness, he suddenly exclaims,
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>"Who shall engage me
in battle with the brier and thorn?"</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or, as
some render it, "Who shall set me as a brier and thorn?" Yet it might not be
amiss also to read, "Who shall bring against me a brier, that I may meet it as a
thorn?" for there is no copulative conjunction between those two words. Yet I
willingly adhere to the former opinion, that God wishes to have to deal with
thistles or thorns, which be will quickly consume by the fire of his wrath. If
any one choose rather to view it as a reproof of those doubts which often arise
in us in consequence of unbelief, when we think that God is inflamed with wrath
against us, as if he had said, "You are mistaken in comparing me to the brier
and thorn," that is, "You ascribe to me a harsh and cruel disposition," let him
enjoy his opinion, though I think that it is different from what the Prophet
means.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F450</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">Others
think that God assumes the character of a man who is provoking himself to rage;
as if he had said, "I do not choose to be any longer so indulgent, or to
exercise such forbearance as I have formerly manifested;" but this is so forced,
that it does not need a lengthened refutation. It is true, indeed, that since
God is gentle and merciful in his nature, and there is nothing that is more
foreign to him than harshness or cruelty, he may be said to borrow a nature that
does not belong to him.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F451</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But the interpretation which I have given will of itself be sufficient to refute
others, namely, that God complains bitterly that ye will as soon fight with
thorns as with his vineyard, for when he considers that it is his inheritances
he is compelled to spare it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
will pass through them in a hostile manner, and utterly consume
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> These words confirm my former exposition;
for the burning relates to "briers and thorns," and he declares that, if he had
to deal with them, he would burn them all up, but that he acts more gently,
because it is his vineyard. Hence we infer that, if God is not enraged against
us, this must be attributed, not to any merits of men, but to his election,
which is of free grace. By these words,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ynnty
ym</font><font face="Palatino">, (<i>mi yitteneni</i>,) "Who shall give me?" he
plainly shews that he has just cause for contending with us, and even for
destroying us in a hostile manner, were he not restrained by compassion towards
His Church; for we would be as thorns and briers, and would be like wicked men,
if the Lord did not separate us from them, that we might not perish along with
them. If the phrase

(o,) is frequently a disjunctive conjunction,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F453</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and therefore this passage is explained as if the particle had been twice used,
"<i>Either</i> let her take hold of my strength, <i>or</i> let her make peace
with me;" that is, "If she do not enter into favor with me, she will feel my
strength to her great loss." Others explain it somewhat differently, "Who shall
take hold of my strength?" that is, "Who shall restrain me?" But I pass by this
interpretation, because I consider it to be too far-fetched. I return to that
which is more generally received.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is supposed
that God threatens the Jews in order to try all the ways and methods by which
they may be brought back to the right path; for God is laid under a necessity to
urge us in various ways, because we are accustomed to abuse his forbearance and
goodness. On this account he frequently threatens to punish us for our
ingratitude, as Isaiah appears to do in this passage, "If they do not choose to
avail themselves of my kindness, and repent, that they may return to favor with
me, they shall feel my strength,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F454</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which I have hitherto restrained." Yet another meaning equally appropriate might
perhaps be drawn from it, as if God exhorted his people to acknowledge his
power, which leads them to seek reconciliation; for whence comes that brutish
indifference which makes us view without alarm the wrath of God, but because we
do not think of his power with due
reverence?</font><br><font face="Palatino">But I prefer to view it as a
question, as in other passages also it frequently has this meaning.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F455</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
"Will he take hold of my strength, so as to enter into peace with me?" As if a
father, anxious and perplexed about his son, were to groan and complain, "Will
not this scoundrel
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F456</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
allow himself to receive benefit? for I know not how I ought to treat him; he
cannot endure severity, and he abuses my goodness. What shall I do? I will
banish him till he repent, and then he will feel how great is that fatherly
power by which I have hitherto preserved him. Since he does not permit me to
exercise forbearance, he must be treated with the utmost rigour of the law. Will
he not then perceive how great my power is, that he may come into a state of
favor with me?" We shall understand this better, if we consider that the source
of all our distresses is, that we are not affected with a sense of the divine
goodness; for if we should take into consideration the greatness of the
blessings which we have received from God, we should quickly be drawn aside from
our iniquities and transgressions, and should desire to return into a state of
favor with him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here we see what care about our
salvation is manifested by our Heavenly Father, who wishes us to take hold of
his power and goodness, that we may know how great it is, and may partake of it
more and more abundantly; for he would wish to deal with us on the same familiar
terms as with his children, if we did not prevent him by our wickedness. Since,
therefore, we are incapable of enjoying his fatherly tenderness, he must display
his strength and majesty, that, being awed by it, and affected by the
anticipation of the judgment, we may humbly entreat him, and sincerely implore
peace and pardon. Now, this is done when we are truly
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F457</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
converted to him; for, so long as we please ourselves, and flatter our vices, we
cannot but displease him; and, on the other hand, if we enter into peace with
him, we must make war against Satan and sin.</font><br><font face="Palatino">How
earnestly God desires to be reconciled to us appears still more clearly from the
repetition of the words. He might have said, in a single word, that he is
merciful and ready to bestow pardon; and therefore, when he twice repeats the
words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he may make peace
with me,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he declares that willingly and most
earnestly he hastens to blot out all our
offenses.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Afterwards
</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F458</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall Jacob put forth
roots.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now gives actual proof of that love
of which he formerly spoke. In order to understand it better, we must consider
the condition of that ancient people; for it was the heritage of God, not
through its own merits, but by the blessing of adoption. The Lord might justly
have been offended at that nation to such an extent as to destroy it utterly,
and blot out its name; but he refrained from exercising such severity, because
he had to deal with his vineyard and heritage. He aimed at nothing more than
that the people should acknowledge their guilt and return to his favor; and
therefore he followed up the former statement with this promise, lest the
people, struck with excessive terror at that power which exhibits the judgments
of God and his chastisements and stripes, should grow disheartened; for the
contemplation of the judgment of God might throw us into despair, if we did not
entertain some hope of being restored. Accordingly, he says
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jacob shall again put
forth roots.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> "Though I shall lessen my Church,
and reduce it to a very small number, yet it shall be restored to its ancient
and flourishing condition, so as to fill the whole world; for, after having once
been reconciled, it will be more and more increased." This metaphor borrowed
from <i>roots</i> is highly elegant; for by the wrath of the Lord we are as it
were cut off, so that we appear to be completely slain and dead; but to whatever
extent the Lord afflicts his Church, he never allows the roots to die, but they
are concealed for a time, and at length bring forth their
fruit.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the face of the
world shall be filled with fruit.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What he now
says, that "the world shall be filled with the fruit" of those roots, was
accomplished at the coming of Christ, who collected and multiplied the people of
God by the gospel; and Israel was united with the Gentiles in one body, so that
the distinction which formerly existed between them was removed.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:14.) Now, we know that the gospel, and all the fruit that sprung from it,
proceeded from the Jews.

Hath he smitten him?</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F459</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He confirms the former statement, and shews that, even in chastisements, there
are certain and manifest proofs of the goodness and mercy of God; for while the
Lord chastises his people, he moderates the severity in such a manner as always
to leave some room for compassion. There are various ways of explaining this
verse. Some interpret it thus: "Did I smite Israel as his enemies smote him? The
Assyrians did not at all spare him: they acted towards him with the utmost
cruelty. But I laid a restraint on my wrath, and did not smite as if I wished to
destroy him; and thus I gave abundant evidence that I am not his enemy." But I
prefer another and commonly received interpretation, which lends us to
understand that a difference between believers and the reprobate is here
declared; for God punishes both indiscriminately, but not in the same manner.
When he takes vengeance on the reprobate, he gives loose reins to his anger;
because he has no other object in view than to destroy them; for they are
"vessels of wrath, appointed to destruction,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450922&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:22,) and have no experience of the goodness of God. But when he chastises the
godly, he restrains his wrath, and has another and totally different object in
view; for he wishes to bring them back to the right path, and to draw them to
himself, that provision may be made for their future
happiness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But it may be asked, Why does the
Prophet employ a circuitous mode of expression, and say, "according to the
stroke of him that smote him?" I answer, he did so, because the Lord often
employs the agency of wicked men in chastising us, in order to depress and
humble us the more. It is often a very sore temptation to us, when the Lord
permits us to be oppressed by the tyranny of wicked men; for we have doubts
whether it is because he favors them, or because he deprives us of his
assistance, as if he hated us. To meet this doubt, he says that he does indeed
permit wicked men to afflict his people, and to exercise their cruelty upon them
for a time, but that he will at length punish them for their wickedness more
sharply than they punished the godly persons. Yet, if any one choose to adopt
the former interpretation, namely, that the Lord will not deal with us as with
enemies, I have no objection. Hence arises also that saying, that "it is better
to fall into the hands of God than into the hands of men; " for the Lord can
never forget his covenant, that he will deal in a gentle and fatherly manner
with his Church.

he pays such regard to their weakness that he never permits them to be oppressed
beyond measure. As to the word

(<i>beshallechach</i>.) Interpreters are not agreed as to the meaning of this
word. Some think that it means, "by engaging them in internal wars with each
other," and others, "that God will punish their sins by that sword which they
have drawn and put into his hand." But as I cannot approve of either of those
interpretations, I pass them by. I approve more highly of those who interpret
it, "in her shootings forth," that is, in plants; so as to mean, that in
inflicting punishment, the Lord attacks not only their outward circumstances,
but also their persons. We know that the Lord's chastisements are various. The
more light and moderate are those by which he takes from us only external
blessings, which are called "the good things of fortune." So then God punishes
believers in such a manner as not only to afflict their persons, but to take
from them what is necessary for the support of life, such as corn, wine, oil,
and other things of that kind which the earth produces; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jl&ccedil;
</font><font face="Palatino">(<i>shalach</i>) signifies to "shoot forth," and to
"produce."</font><br><font face="Palatino">But I have another exposition which
comes nearer to the Prophet's meaning, that <i>in shooting forth</i> God
contends with the Church, because, though he cuts down the branches and even the
trunk, yet his wrath does not extend to the roots, so as to prevent the tree
from again shooting forth; for there is always some remaining vigor in the
roots, which he never permits to die. And this agrees with what goes before,
when he promised (verse 6) that Israel would bring forth "fruit." This explains
what he formerly said, <i>in measure</i>; namely, that he will not pull up the
root; for the Lord cuts down what appears outwardly, such as branches and
leaves, but defends the root and preserves it safe. But, on the other hand, he
tears up the reprobate by the roots, and cuts them down in such a manner that
they can never rise
again.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Though he blow with his
violent wind.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some translate it, "he blew with
his wind," but I think that the meaning is made more clear by saying, "though he
blow." He continues the metaphor, by which he had alluded to herbs and plants,
which a violent wind causes to wither, but only in appearance; for the root is
always safe. Thus though the Lord attacks believers with great violence, and
takes away all their beauty and comeliness, so that they appear to be entirely
slain, yet he usually preserves in them some internal
vigor:</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the day of the east
wind.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When the Prophet spoke of "the day of the
east wind," he had his eye on the situation of Judea, to which, as we learn from
other passages, that easterly wind was injurious. We know that each country has
its own particular wind that is injurious to it; for in some countries the north
wind, in others the south wind, and in others the east or equinoctial wind,
occasions great damage, throwing down the corn, scorching or spoiling all the
fruits, blasting the trees, and scarcely leaving anything in the fields
uninjured. By "the east wind" in this passage, is supposed to be meant "the
equinoctial wind," which in many countries is very
destructive.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore in this manner shall
the iniquity of Jacob be expiated.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> After having
spoken of the chastisement of the people, he begins to state more clearly that
the Lord promotes the interests of his people by these chastisements, so that
they derive benefit from them. He had mentioned this formerly, but now he
explains it more fully, that all the chastisements which God inflicts will tend
to wash away the sins of his people, that thus they may be reconciled to
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">A question arises, Are our sins expiated by
the stripes with which God chastises us? For if it be so, it follows that we
must satisfy God for our sins, as the Papists teach. These two things are
closely connected. If God punish us for our sins in order to expiate them, when
punishments are not inflicted, satisfactions must come in their room. But this
difficulty will be easily removed, if we consider that here the Prophet does not
handle the question, whether we deserve the forgiveness of sins on account of
our works, or whether the punishments which God inflicts on us may be regarded
as making amends for them. He simply shews that chastisements are the remedies
by which God cures our diseases, because we are wont to abuse his goodness and
patience. God must therefore bring us to acknowledgment of our sins, and to
patience; and thus the punishments which he inflicts as chastisements for our
sins are remedies, because our desires may be said to be consumed by them as by
fire,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F460</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to which also Scripture frequently compares them.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;196610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
66:10; 89:46.) In no respect can they yield satisfaction, but men are prepared
by them for repentance. Hence he shews, therefore, that the godly have no reason
for exclaiming against God's chastisements, and that they ought to acknowledge,
on the contrary, that their salvation is thus promoted, because otherwise they
would not acknowledge the grace of God. If any person wish to have a short
reply, we may state it in a single word, that chastisements expiate our offenses
indirectly, but not directly, because they lead us to repentance, which again,
in its turn, brings us to obtain the forgiveness of
sins.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And this is all the
fruit, the taking away of his sin.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some render
it in the genitive case, "the fruit of the taking away of his sin; " but I
prefer to read it in the nominative case.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lk</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>chol</i>,) <i>all</i>, frequently means, "great and abundant;" and therefore
it denotes the plentiful fruit by which the chastisements will be followed. In a
word, he intends to commend to us God's chastisements on the ground of their
usefulness, that the godly may bear them with calmness and moderation, when they
know that by means of them they are purged and prepared for salvation.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F461</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And immediately afterwards the Prophet explains his meaning more clearly by
speaking of abolishing superstitions. So long as the people of Israel enjoyed
prosperity, they did not think of repentance; for it is natural to men that
prosperity should make them insolent and harden them more and more. He therefore
shews how, in chastising his people, God also takes away their sin, because,
having formerly indulged in wickedness and proceeded to greater lengths in
sinning in consequence of his goodness and forbearance, they shall now know that
they were justly punished, and shall change their life and
conduct.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When he shall have
made all the stones of the altar.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here Isaiah,
by a figure of speech, exhibits a single class, so as to explain the whole by
means of a part, and describes in general terms the removal of idolatry and
superstitions; for lie does not speak of the <i>altar</i> which was consecrated
to God, but of that which they had erected to their idols. Thus, when the stones
of it shall have been broken, and the idols thrown down and destroyed, so that
no trace of superstition shall be seen, the iniquity of the people shall at the
same time be removed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence it ought to be
remarked, first, that we ought not to expect pardon from the Lord, unless we
likewise repent of our sins; for whosoever flatters himself must be the object
of the anger of God,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F462</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
whom he does not cease to provoke, and our iniquity is taken away only when we
are moved by a true feeling of repentance. Secondly, it ought to be observed,
that though repentance is an inward feeling of the heart, yet it brings forth
its fruits before men. In vain do we profess that we fear God, if we do not give
evidence of it by outward works; for the root cannot be separated from its
fruits. Thirdly, it ought to be inferred, that idolatry is chiefly mentioned
here, because it is the source of all evils. So long as the pure worship of God
and the true religion are maintained, there is also room for the duties of
brotherly kindness, which necessarily flow from it; but when we forsake God, he
permits us also to fall into every kind of vices. And this is the reason why,
under the name of idolatry, he includes likewise other acts of wickedness.
Besides, we see that he condemns not only statues and images, but everything
that had been invented by the Jews contrary to the injunction of the law; and
hence it follows that he sets aside every kind of false
worship.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That groves and
images may never rise again.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By adding this, he
shews how strongly God abhors idolatry, the remembrance of which he wishes to be
completely blotted out, so that not even a trace of it shall henceforth be seen.
Yet the Prophet intended to express something more, namely, that our repentance
ought to be of such a kind that we shall steadfastly persevere in it; for we
will not say that it is true repentance, if any one, through a sudden impulse of
feeling, shall put down superstitions, and afterwards shall gradually allow them
to spring up and bud forth; as we see to be the case with many who at first burn
with some appearance of zeal, and afterwards grow cold. But here the Prophet
describes such steadfastness that they who have once laid aside their filth and
pollution maintain their purity to the
end.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yet the defenced city shall be
desolate</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here the copulative
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>vau</i>) is generally supposed to mean <i>for</i>, and some take it for
<i>otherwise</i>. There will thus be a twofold interpretation; for if we
translate it <i>because</i>, the Prophet will assign a reason for the former
statement, but that exposition is rejected by the context, and is altogether
absurd. With greater plausibility it is taken for <i>otherwise</i>; for this
threatening might be appropriately introduced, "If you do not repent, you see
what awaits you, the defenced city shall be like a wilderness." But I consider
that exposition to be a departure from the natural meaning, and therefore I
choose rather to take it as signifying <i>nevertheless</i> or
<i>yet</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet means that Jerusalem and
the other cities of Judea must "nevertheless" be destroyed, and that, although
the Lord wishes to spare his people, it is impossible for them to be preserved.
Godly men would have grown disheartened, when they saw that holy city overthrown
and the temple demolished; but from these predictions they learned that God
would have abundance of methods for preserving the Church, and were supported by
that consolation. So then the Prophet intended to meet this very sore
temptation; and hence also we learn that we ought never to lose courage, though
we suffer every hardship, and though the Lord treat us with the utmost severity.
Although this threatening extends to the whole of Judea, yet I think it probable
that it relates chiefly to Jerusalem, which was the metropolis of the
nation.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall the calf
feed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This metaphor is frequently employed by
the prophets when they speak of the desolation of any city; for they immediately
add, that it will be a place for pasture. Here we ought to take into account the
judgment of God, which places <i>calves</i> and brute beasts in the room of the
Jews who had profaned the land by their crimes. Having been adopted by God to be
his children, with good reason ought they to have obeyed so kind a Father; but
since they had shaken off the yoke and given themselves up to wickedness, it was
the just reward of their ingratitude, that the land should be possessed by
better inhabitants, taken not from the human race but from brute

What he says about the "tops" tends to shew more strongly the desolation; as if
he had said that there will be such abundance of grass that the calves will crop
none but the tender parts.

(<i>saiph</i>) signifies also <i>branch</i>; but as branches naturally rise
high, I take it here for <i>summit</i> or <i>top</i>. It might also be thought
that there is an allusion to the beauty of the city, and that as its houses
formerly were lofty and magnificent, when these have been thrown down, nothing
will be seen in it but herbs and leaves, the "tops" of which the calves which
enjoy abundant pasture will eat in
disdain.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When its harvest shall
wither.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F464</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Some think that the Prophet has in his eye the metaphor of a vineyard, which he
employed at the beginning of the chapter, and therefore they translate
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ryxq</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>katzir</i>,) <i>branches</i>. The word is certainly ambiguous; but as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ryxq</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>katzir</i>) means also a <i>harvest</i>, and as the metaphor of a
<i>harvest</i> is more appropriate, I prefer to take it in that sense. Nor do I
translate it, "When the harvest shall be withered," but "When the harvest shall
wither." In this passage <i>wither</i> means nothing else than to approach to
maturity. Before the harvest of the land is ripe, it shall be cut down; as if he
had said, "The Lord will take away from thee the produce which thou thoughest to
be already prepared for thee and to be in thy
hand."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The women coming shall
burn it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When he says that "women shall come,"
he means that God will have no need of robust soldiers to execute his judgment,
and that he will only make use of the agency of women. This exhibits in a still
stronger light the disgracefulness of the punishment, for he threatens that the
calamity shall also be accompanied by disgrace; because it is more shameful and
humiliating to be plundered by "women," who are unused to war, than by
men.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For it is a people of no
understanding.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> At length he assigns the reason
of so heavy a calamity. At first sight it might appear to be excessively harsh
that the Lord should permit the people whom he had chosen to be wretchedly
tormented and scattered, and not to render them any assistance; for it is
inconsistent with his kindness and fatherly love which he bears towards them.
But the Prophet shews that God had good reason for punishing the Jews with such
severity; for they were destitute of knowledge and sound
"understanding."</font><br><font face="Palatino">Nor is it without reason that
he pronounces ignorance to have been the source of all evils; for since "the
fear of God is the beginning of wisdom,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;200107&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
1:7;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
111:10,) they who despise God and obey the wicked passions of their flesh are
justly condemned by the Spirit of God as blind and mad. And yet such ignorance
does not at all excuse us or lessen the guilt of our wickedness; for they who
sin are conscious of their sinfulness, though they are blinded by their lust.
Wickedness and ignorance are therefore closely connected, but the connection is
of such a nature that ignorance proceeds from the sinful disposition of the
mind. Hence it comes that "ignorance," or "ignorances," is the general name
given by the Hebrew writers to every kind of sin, and hence also that saying of
Moses,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"O that they were wise

32:29.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Any man will easily perceive this, if he consider how
great is the power of evil passions to trouble us; for when we have been
deprived of the light of doctrine, and are void of understanding, the devil
drives us as it were to madness, so that we do not dread the arm of God, and
have no respect for his holy
word.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore their Maker
will not have compassion on them.</i> </font><font face="Palatino">For the
purpose of still heightening their terror, he at length takes away all hope of
pardon; for even if a remnant was preserved, the wrath of God did not on that
account cease to rage against the multitude at large. The Prophet here calls God
the <i>Maker</i> and <i>Creator</i> of Israel, not in the same manner that he is
called the Creator of heaven and earth,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
1:1,) but inasmuch as he has formed his Church by the Spirit of regeneration. In
like manner Paul also declares, that in that sense we are

19:25.) Isaiah made this statement, in order to exhibit more strongly the
ingratitude of the people, and to shew how justly they deserve to be punished,
since, after having been formed and preserved by God, they treated him with
dishonor and contempt.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And yet it shall come to pass on
that day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He softens the harshness of the
former statement; for it was a dreadful judgment of God, that the people were
deprived of all hope of mercy and favor. The particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>vau</i>) must therefore be explained as in the tenth verse,
"<i>Nevertheless</i>, or, <i>and yet</i> it shall come to pass on that
day."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That Jehovah shall
thrash.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet speaks metaphorically; for
he compares the gathering of the Church to the "thrashing" of wheat, by which
the grain is separated from the chaff. The meaning of the metaphor is, that the
people were so completely overwhelmed by that captivity that they appeared to be
nothing else than grain concealed or scattered here and there under the chaff.
It was necessary that the Lord should "thrash," as with a fan, what was
concealed amidst the confused mass; so that this gathering was justly compared
to "thrashing."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From the
channel of the river to the river of Egypt.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By
this he means Euphrates and the Nile; for the people were banished, partly into
Chaldea or Assyria, and partly into Egypt. Many fled into Egypt, while others
were carried captive into Babylon. He therefore foretells that the Lord will
gather his people, not only from Chaldea, and from the whole of Mesopotamia, but
also from Egypt.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And you shall
be gathered one by one.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">Dja
djal</font><font face="Palatino">, (<i>leahad</i> <i>ehad</i>,) which we have
translated "one by one," is translated by others "each out of each place;" but
this is an excessively forced exposition, and the exposition which I have stated
appears to me more simple. Yet there are two senses which the words will bear;
either, "I will gather you into one body," or "I will gather you, not in
companies nor in great numbers, but one after another," as usually happens when
men who had wandered and been scattered are gathered; for they do not all
assemble suddenly, but approach to each other by degrees. The Jews were
scattered and dispersed in such a manner that they could not easily be gathered
together and formed into one body; and therefore he shews that this dispersion
will not prevent them from being restored to a flourishing condition. This was
afterwards fulfilled; for the Jews were gathered and brought back, not by a
multitude of horsemen or chariots, not by human forces, or swords, or arms, as
Hosea states, but solely by the power of God.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;280107&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
1:7.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It shall also come to pass in
that day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is the explanation of the former
verse. He speaks metaphorically, and shews that so great will be the power of
God, that he will easily bring back his people. As kings assemble large armies
by the sound of a trumpet, so he shews that it will be easy for the Lord to
gather his people, on whom prophecy had not less efficacy than the trumpet by
which soldiers are
mustered.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall come
who were perishing.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He calls them
<i>perishing</i>, because they were miserably scattered, and appeared to be very
near destruction, without any hope of being restored. The enemies, while their
monarchy lasted, would never have permitted their captives to return, nor had
they led them into banishment in a distant country with any other design than
that of gradually casting into oblivion the name of
Israel.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And who had been
scattered in the land of Egypt.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What he adds
about Egypt contains a more remarkable testimony of pardon, namely, that those
who fled into Egypt, though they did not deserve this favor, shall be gathered.
They had offended God in two respects, as Jeremiah plainly shews; first, because
they were obstinate and rebellious; and, secondly, because they had refused to
obey the revelation,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;242810&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
28:10, 11;) for they ought to have submitted to the yoke of the Babylonians
rather than flee into Egypt in opposition to the command of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And shall worship Jehovah
in the holy mountain.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> At length, he describes
the result of their deliverance, that the Jews, having returned from captivity
into their country, may again worship God their deliverer in a pure and lawful
manner. By the <i>mountain</i> he means the temple and sacrifices. This was
indeed accomplished under Darius, but the Prophet undoubtedly intended to extend
this prophecy farther; for that restoration was a kind of dark foreshadowing of
the deliverance which they obtained through Christ, at whose coming the sound of
the spiritual trumpet, that is, of the gospel, was heard, not only in Assyria or
Egypt, but in the most distant parts of the world. Then were the people of God
gathered, to flow together to Mount Zion, that is, to the Church. We know that
this mode of expression is frequently employed by the prophets when they intend
to denote the true worship of God, and harmony in religion and godliness; for
they accommodated themselves to the usages of the people that they might be
better understood. We know also that the gospel proceeded out of Zion; but on
this subject we have spoken fully at the second chapter.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Woe to the crown of
pride.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Isaiah now enters on another and
different subject from that which goes before it; for this discourse must be
separated from the former one. He shews that the anger of the Lord will quickly
overtake, first, Israel, and afterwards the Jews; for it is probable that the
kingdom of Israel was still entire when the Prophet uttered these predictions,
though nothing more can be affirmed with certainty than that there is good
reason to believe that the ten tribes had not at that time been led into
captivity.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Accordingly, the Prophet follows this
order. First, he shews that the vengeance of God is not far from Israel, because
various sins and corruption of every kind prevailed in it; for they were swelled
with pride and insolence, had plunged into their luxuries and given way to every
kind of licentiousness, and, consequently, had broken out into open contempt of
God, as is usually the case when men take excessive liberties; for they quickly
forget God. Secondly, he shews that God in some measure restrains his anger by
sparing the tribe of Judah; for when the ten tribes, with the half tribe of
Benjamin, had been carried into captivity, the Jews still remained entire and
uninjured. Isaiah extols this compassion which God manifested, in not permitting
his Church to perish, but preserving some remnant. At the same time he shews
that the Jews are so depraved and corrupted that they do not permit God to
exercise this compassion, and that, in consequence of the wickedness which
prevailed among them, not less than in Israel, they too must feel the avenging
hand of God. This order ought to be carefully observed; for many persons blunder
in the exposition of this passage, because the Prophet has not expressly
mentioned the name of Israel, though it is sufficiently known that
<i>Ephraim</i> includes the ten tribes.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As to
the words, since the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ywh</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>hoi</i>) very frequently denotes "wishing evil on a person," I was unwilling
to depart from the ordinary opinion of commentators, more especially because the
Prophet openly threatens in this passage; yet if the translation, <i>Alas
the</i> <i>crown!</i> be preferred, I have no
objection.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the excellence

The copulative
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>vau</i>) signifies <i>for</i> or <i>because</i>. He compares the "glory" and
"excellence" of Israel to "a fading flower," as will afterwards be stated. In
general, he pronounces a curse on the wealth of the Israelites; for by the word
"Crown" he means nothing else than the wicked confidence with which they were
puffed up, and which proceeded from the excess of their riches. These vices are
almost always joined together, because abundance and fullness produce cruelty
and pride; for we are elated by prosperity, and do not know how to use it with
moderation. They inhabited a rich and fertile country, and on this account Amos
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;300401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Amos
4:1) calls them "fat cows," which feed on the mountain of Samaria. Thus, being
puffed up by their wealth, they despised both God and men. The Prophet calls
them "drunkards," because, being intoxicated by prosperity, they dreaded no
adversity, and thought that they were beyond the reach of all danger, and that
they were not even subject to God
himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A fading
flower.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He alludes, I doubt not, to the crowns
or chaplets
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F468</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which were used at banquets, and which are still used in many places in the
present day. The Israelites indulged in gluttony and drunkenness, and the
fertility of the soil undoubtedly gave occasion to their intemperance. By
calling it "a fading flower" he follows out his comparison, elegantly alluding
to flowers which suddenly
wither.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which is on the head

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F469</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

saw under their feet their pastures, the fertility of which still more inflamed
their pride.

(<i>shemanim</i>) is translated by some "of ointments;" but that is
inapplicable, for it denotes abundance and fullness, which led them to neglect
godliness and to despise God. By the word "head" or "top," he alludes to the
position of the country, because the Israelites chiefly inhabited rich valleys.
He places on it a crown, which surrounds the whole kingdom; because it was
flourishing and abounded in every kind of wealth. This denotes riches, from
which arose sluggishness, presumption, rashness, intemperance, and cruelty. This
doctrine relates to us also; for the example of these men reminds us that we
ought to use prosperity with moderation, otherwise we shall be very unhappy, for
the Lord will curse all our riches and
abundance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>

which the Lord will cast them down from this lofty
pride.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As a deluge of

"hail," by which both herbs and flowers are thrown down, and all the beauty of

destructive to flowers than a heavy shower or "hail." He makes use of the

appears to me to be, that the glory and splendor of the Israelites will be laid
low, as if one threw down a drunk man "with the hand." The same statement is
confirmed by him in the third verse.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>

As Dionysius the Second,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F470</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in consequence of gorging himself at unseasonable banquets, was seized with such
blindness that he constantly stumbled, so pleasures and luxuries blind the minds
of men in such a manner that they no longer know either God or themselves. The
Prophet therefore inculcates the same truth frequently on the minds of men who
were stupid and amazed, that they might understand what would otherwise have
appeared to them to be incredible.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F471</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As
the hasty fruit before the summer.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now
illustrates the subject by another metaphor exceedingly beautiful and
appropriate; for the first-ripe fruits are indeed highly commended, because they
go before others, and hold out the expectation of the rest of the produce; but
they last but a short time, and cannot be preserved, for they are quickly eaten
up either by pregnant women, or by children, or by men who do not make a proper
selection of their food. He says that the happiness of the Israelites will be of
that sort, because their flourishing prosperity will not be of long duration,
but will be swallowed up in a moment. What Isaiah declared about the kingdom of
Israel, applies also to the whole world. By their ingratitude men prevent all
the goodness which the Lord has bestowed on them from reaching maturity; for we
abuse his blessings and corrupt them by our wickedness. The consequence is, that
hasty and short-lived fruits are produced, which could not yield to us continual
nourishment.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that day shall the Lord of
hosts.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> After having spoken of the kingdom of
Israel, he passes to the tribe of Judah, and shews that, amidst this severe
vengeance of God, there will still be room for compassion, and that, although
ten tribes perished, yet the Lord will preserve some <i>remnant</i>, which he
will consecrate to himself; so that there will be in it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a crown of glory and diadem of
excellence,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, that the Church is never
disfigured in such a manner that the Lord does not adorn it with beauty and
splendor.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet I do not extend this prophecy
indiscriminately to all the Jews, but to the elect who were wonderfully rescued
from death; for although he calls the tribe and half-tribe <i>a remnant</i>, as
compared with the other ten tribes, yet, as we advance, we shall see that he
makes a distinction between the tribe of Judah itself and the others. Nor ought
we to wonder that the Prophet speaks differently about the same people,
directing his discourse, sometimes to a body corrupted by crimes, and sometimes
to the elect. Certainly, as compared with the ten tribes, which had revolted
from the worship of God and from the unity of faith, he justly calls the Jews a
<i>remnant</i> of the people; but when he leaves out of view this comparison,
and considers what they are in themselves, he remonstrates with equal justice
against their corruptions.</font><br><font face="Palatino">I am aware that some
expound it differently, on account of what is said immediately afterwards about
<i>wine and strong drink</i>, (verse 7,) and think that this statement ought to
be viewed in connection with the beginning of the chapter. Yet perhaps the Lord
spares the Jews. But how would he spare them? They are in no respect better than
the others; for they are equally in fault,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F472</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and must also be exposed to the same punishments. But those commentators do not
consider that the Prophet holds out an instance of the extraordinary kindness of
God, in not exercising his vengeance at the same time against the whole family
of Abraham, but, after having overthrown the kingdom of Israel, granting a truce
to the Jews, to see if they would in any degree repent. Neither do they consider
that, by the same means, he employs the circumstance which he had stated for
placing in a stronger light the ingratitude of the people, that is, that they
ought to have been instructed by the example of their brethren;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F473</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for the calamity of Israel ought to have aroused and excited them to repentance,
but it produced no impression on them, and did not make them better. Although
therefore they were unworthy of so great benefits, yet the Lord was pleased to
preserve his Church in the midst of them; for this is the reason why he rescued
the tribe of Judah, and the half-tribe of Benjamin, from that
calamity.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, since the tribe of Judah was a
small portion of the nation, and therefore was despised by the haughty
Israelites, the Prophet declares that in God alone there is enough of riches and
of glory to supply all earthly defects. And hence he shews what is the true
method of our salvation, namely, if we place our happiness in God; for as soon
as we come down to the world, we gather fading flowers, which immediately wither
and decay. This madness reigns everywhere, and more than it ought to be among
ourselves, that we wish to be happy without God, that is, without happiness
itself. Besides, Isaiah shews that no calamities, however grievous, can prevent
God from adorning his Church; for when it shall appear that everything is on the
eve of destruction, God will still be a crown of glory to his people. It is also
worthy of observation, that Isaiah promises new splendor to the Church only when
the multitude shall be diminished, that believers may not lose courage on
account of that dreadful calamity which was at
hand.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And for a spirit of
judgment.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He explains the manner in which the
Lord will adorn that "remnant" with additional splendor; for he holds out
instances of the true art of civil government, which mainly contributes to the
upholding of nations. It consists chiefly of two things, <i>counsel</i> and
<i>strength</i>. The internal administration must be conducted by counsel and
wisdom, and "strength" and force are needed against enemies who are without.
Since therefore it is by these two defences that kingdoms and commonwealths
defend and uphold their rank, he promises to his people the spirit of "wisdom"
and "strength." At the same time he shews that it is God who gives both, and
that they ought not to be expected from any other; for magistrates will not be
able to rule and to administer justice in a city, and military generals will not
be able to repel enemies, unless the Lord shall direct
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But they also have erred through
wine.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He returns to the irreligious despisers
of God, who were Jews in name only, and proves their ingratitude to be highly
aggravated, because, though they had before their eyes a striking proof of the
anger of God, when they saw their brethren severely chastised, and not
withstanding experienced God's forbearance towards themselves, yet neither that
example of severity, nor the conviction of the divine goodness, could bring them
back into the right path, or make them in any respect better, although the Lord
spared them. Here he speaks of "wine and strong drink" metaphorically; for I do
not understand it to relate to ordinary drunkenness, against which he
remonstrated at the beginning of the chapter, but, on the contrary, he says that
they were like drunk men, because they wanted knowledge and sound understanding.
If the word <i>as</i> be supplied before the words "through wine and through
strong drink," the meaning will be more easily understood. I do acknowledge that
by continued drunkenness men become, as it were, brutalized, and I have no doubt
that drunkenness and excessive eating and drinking contributed also to stupefy
the minds of the Jews; but if we examine the whole of the context, it will be
easy to see that the madness which he condemns is
metaphorical.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The priest and
the prophet have erred.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He proceeds still
farther to exhibit their aggravated guilt, and says that not only the common
people were drunk, but the priests themselves, who ought to have held out the
light and pointed out the path to others; for, as Christ declares, they may be
regarded as "the salt of the earth."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400513&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
5:13.) If they are mad, what shall the common people be? "If the eye is blind,"
what shall become of the other parts of the body?
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400623&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
6:23.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have erred in
vision.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The most grievous thing of all is, when
he says that they err not only in the more flagrant transgressions of life, but
in <i>vision</i> and <i>judgment</i>. Hence we ought to infer how desperate was
the condition of the Jewish Church, and here, as in a mirror, we may behold our
transgressions. It is indeed something monstrous that, after so many
chastisements which God has employed for cleansing it, the Church is so deeply
corrupted; but such is our wickedness that we fight against his strokes,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F474</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and though he continually restrains us, and uses unceasing efforts to purify us
from our sins, we not only render all his remedies useless, but bring upon
ourselves new diseases. We ought not therefore to wonder that in the present
day, after the numerous scourges and afflictions with which the Church has been
chastised, men appear to be obstinate, and even become worse, when Isaiah
testifies that the same thing took place in the ancient Church. True, indeed,
the goodness of the Lord rose above the base and shameful wickedness of that
nation, and still preserved the Church; but this was accomplished by his secret
power, contrary to the expectation of all; for it would be of no advantage to
us, if he employed ordinary remedies.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence also
it is evident how silly and childish is the boasting of the Papists, who always
have in their mouth "The Church," and use as a pretext the names of priests,
bishops, and pontiffs, and wish to fortify themselves by their authority against
the word of God, as if that order could never err or mistake. They think that
they have the Holy Spirit confined within their brains, and that they represent
the Church, which God never forsakes. But we see what the Prophet declares
concerning the priests, whose order was more splendid and illustrious. If ever
there was a Church, there certainly was one at that time among the Jews; and
that order derived from the word of God support to which they have no claim. And
yet he shews that not only were they corrupt in morals, but erred "in vision and
judgment," and that the prophets, whom we know that God added to the priests,
out of the ordinary course, on account of the carelessness of the priests, were
nevertheless blind in that sacred office of teaching and in revelations. Nothing
therefore is more idle than, under the pretext of an office which bears a
splendid title, to hold out as exempt from the danger of erring those who,
having forsaken God, and not only cast away all regard to religion, but even
trodden shame under their feet, defend their tyranny by every means in their
power.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For all tables are full of
vomiting.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He pursues the same metaphor, and
draws, as it were, a picture of what usually happens to men who are given up to
drunkenness; for they forget shame, and not only debase themselves like beasts,
but shrink from nothing that is disgraceful. It is certainly an ugly and
revolting sight to see "tables covered with vomiting;" and, accordingly, under
this figure Isaiah describes the whole life of the people as shameful beyond
endurance. There can be no doubt that the Prophet intended to express by a
single word, that no sincerity or uprightness was left among the Jews. If we
approach their tables, we can find nothing but foul drunkenness; if we look at
their life, no part of it is pure or free from crimes and enormities. Doctrine
itself is so corrupt that it stinks as if it were polluted by vomiting and
filth. In expounding allegories, I have no intention to enter, as some do, into
ingenious disquisitions.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whom shall he teach
knowledge?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here the Prophet shews by an
expression of amazement, that the disease of the people is incurable, and that
God has no other remedies adapted to cure them, for he has tried every method
without effect. When he calls wanderers to return to the right path, and
unceasingly warns those who are thoughtlessly going astray, this undoubtedly is
an extraordinary remedy; and if it do no good, the salvation of those who refuse
to accept of any aid from a physician is utterly
hopeless.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Those who are weaned
from the milk.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet complains that the
stupidity of the people may be said to hinder God from attempting to cure them
of their vices; and therefore he compares the Jews to very young infants,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F475</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
or who are but beginning to prattle, and whom it would be a waste of time to
attempt to teach. Justly indeed does Peter exhort believers to draw near, "like
infants newly born, to suck the milk of pure doctrine;" for no man will ever
shew himself to be willing to be taught until he has laid aside that obstinacy
which is the natural disposition of all.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F476</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 2:2.) But now the Prophet condemns another kind of infancy, in which men
who are stupefied by their vices pay no more regard to heavenly doctrine than if
they had no understanding whatsoever. It is therefore a mistake to connect this
statement of the Prophet with that passage in the Apostle Peter, as if Isaiah
represented God as desirous to obtain disciples who had divested themselves of
all pride, and were like infants lately weaned; for the Prophet, on the
contrary, loudly complains, that to "teach doctrine" is useless, and merely
provokes ridicule among stupid and senseless persons, who are "children, not in
malice, but in understanding," as Paul speaks.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461420&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 14:20.) From what follows it will more clearly appear that, since
they were unfit for receiving doctrine, God cannot be accused of undue severity
if he reject them, and if he resolve not to bestow useless labor by thundering
in their ears any longer.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For precept must be on
precept.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This shews plainly that the Lord
complains of spending his labor to no purpose in instructing this unteachable
people, just as if one were to teach children, who must have elementary
instructions repeated to them over and over again, and quickly forget them, and
when the master has spent a whole day in teaching them a single letter, yet on
the following day and afterwards, the same labor must be renewed, and though he
leave nothing untried that care or diligence can do, still they will make no
progress under him. Those who change the words of this verse, in order to avoid
offending the ears of the readers,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F477</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
obscure the Prophet's meaning through a foolish affectation of copiousness of
language, and even destroy the elegance of the style; for, by using the same
words, he intended to express a repetition which is constant and unceasing, and
full of annoyance. The metaphor, as I have already said, is taken from children,
to whom teachers do not venture to give long lessons, because they are incapable
of them, but give them, as it were, in little drops. Thus, they convey the same
instructions a second and third time, and oftener; and, in short, they continue
to receive elementary instructions till they acquire reason and judgment. By a
witty imitation he repeats the words, "here a little, there a
little."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Instruction upon

The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wq</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>kav</i>) is improperly, in my opinion, translated by some interpreters
<i>line</i>, as if the Prophet alluded to the slow progress of a building, which
rises gradually by "lines." That would be a harsh and far-fetched metaphor, for
this passage relates to elementary instruction conveyed to children. I
acknowledge that the same Hebrew word is used in the eighteenth chapter, where
we have translated it "Line by line,"
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F479</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and in many other passages; but here the connection demands a different meaning,
as is also the case in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191904&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
19:4, where, however, the word <i>line</i>
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F480</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
or <i>dimension</i> could be admitted with greater propriety than in this verse.
Yet I admit that it is taken metaphorically for an instruction or rule; for as
in buildings
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wq</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>kav</i>) denotes the "rule" or "plumb-line," as we shall see that it means
in a later portion of this chapter, we need not wonder that it is applied to
other rules.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F481</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Some supply, that "it is as if one should say;" but that is superfluous. I
therefore view these words as relating to God, who became, as the Prophet tells
us, a barbarian
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F482</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to a people without understanding. This reproof must have wounded them to the
quick, because by their own fault they made God, who formed our tongues, to
appear to be "a stammerer." He does not as yet threaten them, but lays the blame
on their indolence, that they rendered the proclamation of heavenly doctrine a
confused noise, because of their own accord they shut their eyes, and thus
derived no advantage from it. Their infatuation, in not hearing God speaking to
them, is compared by the Prophet to a
prodigy.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For he said to
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some explain it by circumlocution in this
manner: "If one should say to them, This is the rest, they refuse to hear." But
this is a feeble exposition, and does not connect the various parts of the
passage in a proper manner. On the contrary, the Prophet assigns the reason why
God appears to the Jews to be a barbarian: it is, because they had not ears.
Words were spoken to the deaf. It was to no purpose that the Lord offered to
them rest. This deafness arose from obstinacy, for they wickedly and
rebelliously rejected doctrine. Their wickedness was doubly inexcusable in
refusing rest which was offered to them, and which all men naturally desire. It
was in itself intolerable baseness to be deaf to the voice of God speaking, but
it was still more foul ingratitude deliberately to reject a blessing which was
in the highest degree desirable. Accordingly, he points out the benefit which
they might have derived from the obedience of faith, and of which they deprived
themselves by their own wickedness. He therefore reproaches them with this
ignorance and blindness; for it springs from their own stubbornness in
maliciously turning away their eyes from the light which was offered to them,
and choosing rather to remain in darkness than to be
enlightened.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence it follows that unbelievers,
as soon as God has exhibited to them his word, voluntarily draw down on
themselves wretched uneasiness; for he invites all men to a blessed rest, and
clearly points out the object by which, if we shape the course of our life, true
happiness awaits us; for no man who has heard heavenly doctrine can go astray
except knowingly and willingly. We learn from it how lovely in our eyes heavenly
doctrine ought to be, for it brings to us the invaluable blessing of enjoying
peace of conscience and true happiness. All confess loudly that there is nothing
better than to find a place of security; and yet, when rest is offered, many
despise it, and the greater part of men even refuse it, as if all men expressly
desired to have wretched perplexity and continual trembling: and yet no man has
a right to complain that he errs through ignorance; for nothing is clearer or
plainer than the doctrine of God, so that it is vain for men to plead any
excuse. In short, nothing can be more unreasonable than to throw the blame on
God, as if he spoke obscurely, or taught in a confused manner. Now, as God
testifies in this passage that he points out to us in his word assured rest, so,
on the other hand, he warns all unbelievers that they suffer the just reward of
their wickedness when they are harassed by continual
uneasiness.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cause the weary to
rest</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some explain it thus, that God demands
the duties of brotherly kindness, in order that he may be reconciled to us, and
that those duties are here included, a part being taken for the whole. But I
think that the Prophet's meaning is different, namely, that God points out to us
that rest by which our weariness may be relieved, and that consequently we are
convicted of deeper ingratitude, if even necessity, which is a very sharp spur,
does not quicken us to seek a remedy. This saying of the Prophet corresponds
nearly to the words of Christ,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Come to me, all ye that
labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
11:28.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In a word, Isaiah informs the Jews that they have
this choice, "Do they prefer to be refreshed and relieved, or to sink under the
burden and be overwhelmed?" This confirms a passing remark which I made a little
before, that God does not in vain exhort those who seek repose to come to him,
as we shall elsewhere see,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"I have not in vain said
to the house of Jacob, Seek me."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234519&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
45:19.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since, therefore, if we do not stand in the way, we
shall be taught by his word, we may safely rely on the doctrine which is
contained in it; for he does not intend to weary us out by vain curiosity, as
men often draw down upon themselves much distress and anguish by idle
pursuits.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Besides, when he shews that this rest
is prepared for the weary who groan under the burden, let us at least be taught
by the distresses which harass us to betake ourselves to the word of God, that
we may obtain peace. We shall thus find that the word of God is undoubtedly
fitted to soothe our uneasy feelings, and to give peace to our perplexed and
trembling consciences. All who seek "rest" in any other way, and run beyond the
limits of the word, must always be subjected to torture or wretched uncertainty,
because they attempt to be wise and happy without God. We see that this is the
condition of the Papists, who, having despised this peace of God, are wretchedly
tormented during their whole life; for Satan tosses and drives them about in
such a manner that they are tormented with dreadful uneasiness, and never find a
place of rest.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The word of the Lord shall
therefore be to them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Although the Prophet
repeats the same words, yet the meaning is somewhat different; for, having
formerly spoken of voluntary stupidity, he now threatens the punishment of it,
namely, that God will strike them with such bewilderment, that they shall be
totally deprived of the benefit of saving doctrine, and shall perceive in it
nothing but an empty sound. In short, he concludes, from what goes before, that
since they had not profited by the word of God, the Jews shall be justly
punished for their ingratitude; not that the word shall be taken from them, but
that they shall be deprived of sound judgment and understanding, and shall be
blind amidst the clearest light. Thus God blinds and hardens the reprobate more
and more on account of their disobedience.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Paul
quotes this passage
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461421&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 14:21) when he reproves the Corinthians for foolish affectation, in
consequence of their being so much under the influence of ambition, that they
regarded with the highest admiration those who spoke in a foreign tongue, as the
common people are accustomed to stare at everything that is unknown and
uncommon. This passage in the writings of Paul has been misunderstood, because
these words of the Prophet have not been duly weighed. Now, Paul applies these
words most appropriately to his object; for he shews that the Corinthians are
under the influence of a foolish and absurd admiration, and that they improperly
aspire to those things from which they can derive no advantage; in short, that
they are "like children, not in malice, but in knowledge and understanding;"
that thus they voluntarily draw down on themselves the curse which the Prophet
here threatens; and that the word of God becomes to them precept on precept, and
they receive no more instruction from it than if a person were to bawl out to
them in an unknown tongue. It is the height of madness to bring upon themselves,
by idle affectation, that blindness and stupidity which the Lord threatens
against obstinate and rebellious men. Paul therefore explains and renders more
intelligible this statement made by the Prophet, for he shews that they who
abuse the doctrine of salvation do not deserve to make progress in it in any way
whatever.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We have seen a passage closely
resembling it in which the Prophet compared his doctrine to "sealed letters."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230816&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
8:16) Afterwards we shall find that the Prophet compares it to a book that is
"shut."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;232911&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
29:11.) This takes place when, on account of the ingratitude of men, God takes
from them judgment and sound understanding; so that, "seeing they do not see,
and hearing they do not hear," and thus are most justly punished.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
6:9;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;410412&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
4:12.) This ought to be carefully observed; for frequently we think that all is
well with us, and are highly delighted with ourselves, because we continue to
enjoy the word.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F483</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But of what avail will it be to us, if it do not enlighten our understanding and
regulate our hearts? We thus draw down upon ourselves a heavier judgment, and
therefore we need a twofold grace; first, that God would shine on us by his
word; and secondly, that he would open our understandings and dispose our hearts
to obedience, otherwise we shall derive no more aid from the brilliancy of the
gospel than blind men derive from the brightness of the sun. By this punishment,
therefore, we are reminded that we must not abuse the word of God, but must look
directly to the object which the Lord holds out to us in the
word.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall fall
backward, and be broken and snared.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> At length
he describes the destruction of those who are blind to this brightness of the
word; for nothing remains for them but to be thrown down headlong, because they
have departed from the right path, and therefore they must stumble and fall. He
means that the fall will not be slight, for they shall be <i>bruised</i> by it.
By the word <i>sealed</i> he employs another metaphor, namely, that for all
unbelievers "snares" are prepared, by which they shall be entangled and drawn to
destruction. We had a similar sentiment on a former occasion,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
8:15,) and expressed in nearly the same words;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F484</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for there the Prophet speaks on the same subject, the blinding of the people,
who by their obstinacy had provoked the wrath of God. He shews that they who go
astray, in opposition to the word of God, are always very near destruction.
Either they shall meet with stumbling blocks on which they shall "stumble," or
with snares by which they shall be "ensnared." In short, it will be impossible
that evil shall not befall those who do not keep the path which God has pointed
out; for either they shall openly "fall and be bruised," or through concealed
traps they shall fall into a "snare."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore hear ye the word of the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He goes on to address to them still
stronger reproof, and at the same time mingles with it a consolation in order to
encourage the hearts of the godly. While he threatens utter destruction against
the wicked, he leaves for believers ground of consolation, by declaring that
their salvation is dear and precious in the sight of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye scornful
men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By this term he means men who are addicted
to sophistry and deceit, who think that by jeers and cunning they can escape the
judgment of God; for

signifies to <i>jeer</i> or <i>scorn</i>. Now, he addresses not ordinary men,
but rulers and governors, who, in governing the people, thought that they
surpassed other men in sharpness and dexterity, but turned their acuteness to
cunning, by which they acted hypocritically towards God himself, and therefore,
in keen irony, he calls them "scorners;" as if he had said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"You think that you have
enough of craftiness to mock God, but you will not succeed in mocking him."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480607&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Galatians
6:7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet's chief and severest contest was with the
nobles; for although all ranks were exceedingly corrupted, yet the nobles, being
puffed up with a false belief of their own wisdom, were more obstinate than the
rest. It has commonly been found, in almost every age, that the common people,
though they are distinguished by unrestrained fierceness and violence, do not
proceed to such a pitch of wickedness as nobles or courtiers, or other crafty
men, who think that they excel others in ability and wisdom. The ministers of
the word ought chiefly, therefore, to arm themselves against ingenious
adversaries. None can be more destructive; for they not only of themselves do
injury, but excite others to the same kind of scorn and wickedness, and
frequently, through the estimation in which they are held, and the splendor of
their reputation, they dazzle the common people who are less clear-sighted. It
is a dreadful and monstrous thing when the governors of the Church not only are
themselves blinded, but even blind others, and excite them to despise God, and
ridicule godly doctrine, and taunt it by their jeers, and, in short, employ
their utmost ingenuity for overturning religion; but in opposition to such
persons we ought to encourage our hearts by the example of the Prophet, that we
may not sink or lose heart in this contest. He shews us also the way in which we
ought to treat such persons.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F486</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
We ought not to spend much time in teaching them, (for instruction would be of
little use,) but must threaten them severely, and terrify them by the judgment
of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This people which is
in Jerusalem.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Their guilt is highly aggravated
by the consideration that they inhabit the very sanctuary of God, and infect
with their pollution God's chosen
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because ye have
said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet next assigns the reason why
he called them "scorners;" it was because they had thrown off all fear of God.
He likewise describes the manner in which they acted, by saying that they
promised to themselves that they would escape punishment amidst all their crimes
and enormities, and became the more daring, and, as if they had obtained greater
liberty to pursue wicked courses, rushed forward without dread wherever their
unruly passions carried
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have struck a league
with death, and with hell have we made a
compact.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is what he means by the league
into which they had entered with death and the grave; for by despising and
boldly ridiculing all God's threatenings and chastisements, they thought that
they were out of all danger.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hzj</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>chozeh</i>) means what he had formerly expressed by
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tyrb</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>berith</i>,) for it is a repetition of the same statement. Literally it
signifies <i>seeing</i>,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F487</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and denotes what is conveyed by the French phrase, <i>avoir intelligence</i>, or
by the English phrase, "to have a mutual understanding." There appears to be
also an implied contrast between prophetic visions and that deceitful craftiness
on which veterans in wicked arts value
themselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have made lies
our refuge.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is certain that those cunning
men never broke out into such boasting as to utter those offensive words, for
that would have been childish and absurd.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F488</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Besides, though they despised God and set at nought all his admonitions, they
undoubtedly wished to be held in some estimation by the people, and would never
have confessed that they "made lies their refuge; " but the Prophet looked at
their feelings and aims, and not at their pretexts, and took into account their
actions and dispositions, and not their words. Whoever, then, flatters himself
and his vices, and fearlessly despises God's threatenings, declares that he has
"entered into a league with death," which he does not at all dread,
notwithstanding the Lord's threatenings.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The
Prophet, therefore, reproves in general that carnal presumption by which men are
led to forgetfulness of the judgment of God, and willingly deceive themselves,
as if they could escape the arm of God: but chiefly he attacks Lucianists
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F489</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and censorious men, who place their wisdom in nothing else than in irreligious
contempt of God; and the more eager they are to conceal their dishonor, the more
earnestly does the Prophet expose them, as if he had dragged forth to the light,
from a deep concealment, their cunning wiles, and as if he had said, "This is
the dexterity, skill, and cunning of the wise men of this world, who are exposed
on every hand to troubles and afflictions, and yet imagine that they are
concealed and safe. They unquestionably deserve to seek salvation from
falsehood, for they disregard God's salvation, and despise and ridicule him."
Their tricks, and cunning, and imposture, are indeed concealed by them under
plausible names, and they do not think that they are falsehoods; but the Prophet
calls them by their proper
names.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When the overflowing
scourge shall pass through.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As to "the
overflowing scourge," the Prophet here includes two metaphors; for he compares
the calamities and afflictions by which God chastises the transgressions of the
world to a "scourge," and then says, that they are so rapid and violent that
they resemble a "flood." Against those calamities, however severe and
distressing, wicked men of this description think that they are fortified by
lying and deceit, and hope that they shall be able to escape them, though they
overflow far and wide over the whole world. They perceive the judgments of God,
and the calamities to which men are exposed; but, because they do not observe
the hand and providence of God, and ascribe everything that happens to fortune,
they therefore seek to obtain such defences and safeguards as may drive such
"scourges" away from them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore thus saith the Lord
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Isaiah now comforts the godly, and
threatens against the wicked such punishment as they deserved. In the first
instance, he brings forward consolation, because the godly were a laughingstock
to those crafty men, as we see at the present day that irreligious men laugh at
our simplicity, and reckon us to be fools, because amidst such deep adversity
and sore afflictions we still hope that it will turn out to our advantage. In
opposition to this insolence of the reprobate, the Prophet encourages and
supports the hearts of the godly to pass by with indifference, and reckon of no
account their jeers and reproaches, and to believe firmly that their hope will
not be confounded or
vain.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I lay in Zion a
stone, a stone of trial.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The demonstrative
particle <i>behold</i> expresses certainty; as if he had said, "Though wicked
men despise my words, and refuse to believe them, yet I will perform what I have
promised." The pronoun <i>I</i> is emphatic, that the prophecy may be more
firmly believed. As to the words, the genitive!
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;jb</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>bochan</i>,) <i>of trial</i>, which is used instead of an adjective along
with <i>stone</i>, may be taken both in an active and in a passive sense, either
for a stone by which the whole building is "tried," or examined as by a
standard, or for a "tried stone." The former meaning appears to me to be more
appropriate, and undoubtedly the usage of the Hebrew language requires us to
interpret it rather in an active sense. He calls it therefore a trying stone, or
a trier, on account of the effect produced; because by this stone the whole
building must be squared and adjusted, otherwise it must unavoidably totter and
fall.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A precious corner-stone,
a sure foundation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He calls it a corner-stone,
because it supports the whole weight of the building, and by this name, which is
also given to it in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B822&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
118:22, he commends its force and strength. Lastly, he calls it a "foundation,"
and, so to speak, a "fundamental foundation," proceeding gradually in the
commendation of it; for he shews that it is not an ordinary stone, or one of
many which contribute to the building, but that it is a highly valuable stone,
on which the whole weight of the building exclusively rests. It is a stone, but
a stone which fills the whole corner; it is a corner-stone, but the whole house
is founded on it. As "another foundation cannot be laid," so on it alone must
the whole Church, and every part of it, rest and be built.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460311&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 3:11.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that
believeth shall not make haste.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This clause is
interpreted by some as an exhortation, "He that believeth, let him not make
haste." But I prefer to take it in the future tense, both because that meaning
agrees best with the context, and because it is supported by the authority of
the Apostle Paul. I do acknowledge that the Apostles followed the Greek
translation,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F490</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and used such liberty, that while they were satisfied with giving the meaning,
they did not quote the exact words. Yet they never changed the meaning, but,
taking care to have it properly applied, they gave the true and genuine
interpretation. Whenever, therefore, they quote any passage from the Old
Testament, they adhere closely to its object and
design.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, Paul, when he quotes this prophecy,
adopts the Greek version, "He that believeth shall not be ashamed."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450933&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:33; 10:11.) And certainly the design of the Prophet is to shew, that they who
believe will have peace and serenity of mind, so that they shall not desire
anything more, and shall not wander in uncertainty, or hasten to seek other
remedies, but shall be fully satisfied with this alone. That is not a departure
from the meaning, for the word signifying <i>to make</i> <i>haste</i> conveys
the idea of eagerness or trembling. In short, the design of the Prophet is, to
extol faith on account of this invaluable result, that by means of it we enjoy
settled peace and composure. Hence it follows that, till we possess faith, we
must have continual perplexity and distress; for there is but one harbour on
which we can safely rely, namely, the truth of the Lord, which alone will give
us peace and serenity of mind.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This fruit of
faith is elsewhere described by the same Apostle Paul, when he says that, "being
justified by faith, we obtain peace with God."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
5:1.) The Apostles and evangelists shew that this "stone" is Christ, because the
Church was actually settled and founded at the time when he was presented to the
view of the world.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402142&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
21:42;

Peter 2:6.) First, in him the promises have their firmness; secondly, the
salvation of men rests on him alone, and therefore if Christ be taken away, the
Church will fall down and be ruined. The state of the fact therefore shews, that
these statements must undoubtedly be referred to Christ, without whom there is
no certainty of salvation; and therefore at every moment ruin is at hand. Next,
we have the authority of evangelists and Apostles; and indeed the Holy Spirit
conveys that instruction by their mouth.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But it
will be proper to examine it more closely, that we may see in what manner these
things are applied to Christ. First, it is not without good reason that Isaiah
represents God as speaking, whose peculiar work it is to found the Church, as we
have already seen elsewhere, and as the Prophet will afterwards declare; and
this statement occurs very frequently in the Psalms. For if all men devote their
labor to it, they will not be able to lay the least stone. It is God alone,
therefore, who founds and builds his Church, though he employs for this purpose
the labors and services of men. Now, by whom was Christ given, but by the
Father? So then it was the heavenly Father who did and accomplished these
things, and who appointed Christ to be the only foundation on which our
salvation rests.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But was not this stone laid
before? Did not the Church always rest on this foundation? I acknowledge that it
did, but only in hope; for Christ had not yet been revealed, and had not
fulfilled the office of a Redeemer. On this account the Prophet speaks of it as
a future event, that believers may be fully persuaded that the Church, which
they saw not only tottering and falling, but grievously shaken and almost laid
in ruins, will yet be made firm by a new support, when it shall rest on a stone
laid by the hand of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I lay
in Zion.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He says that it is "in Zion;" because
Christ must come out of it, which contributes greatly to confirm our faith, when
we see that he came out of that place which was appointed for this purpose so
long before. Now, at the present day, "Mount Zion" is everywhere; for the Church
has spread to the ends of the world.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Christ is
truly "the stone of trial," for by him must the whole building be regulated, and
we cannot be the building of God, if we are not adapted to him. Hence also Paul
exhorts us to</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"grow in him who is the
head, from whom the whole body must be joined and united."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ephesians
4:15.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Our faith must be wholly applied to Christ, that he
may be our rule. He is also the "corner-stone," on which rests not only one part
of the building, but its whole weight, and the foundation
itself.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"No man," as Paul says,
"can lay any other foundation than Jesus Christ."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460311&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 3:11.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is the reason why, when the Lord promises by the
mouth of Isaiah the restoration of his Church, he reminds us of the foundation;
for it was wasted in such a manner that it resembled a ruin, and there was no
way in which it could be restored but by Christ. As to Christ being called also
the "stone of stumbling," this is accidental; for the fault lies on ungrateful
men, who, having rejected him, find him to be altogether different from what he
would have been to them. But on this subject we have spoken at 8:14.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F491</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will lay judgment to
the line.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The ruinous condition of the Church
being such that believers hardly ventured to hope that it would be improved, he
shews that God has in his hand the ready means of forming the Church entirely
anew. As he lately mentioned a building, so now, by a different metaphor, he
shews that there is no reason to fear that God will not at length finish the
work of building which has been begun. Yet indirectly he reproves the pride and
insolence of those who wished to be accounted pillars of the Church, while they
were endeavoring, as far as lay in their power, to raze it to the foundation.
Although, in consequence of an almost total extinction of the light of faith,
and a frightful corruption of the worship of God, the state of the people was
hideous, yet they boasted of their royal priesthood, in the same manner as we
see the Papists at the present day shamelessly utter similar boasting, though
lamentable confusion cries aloud that the form of the Church has utterly
perished among them. For this reason the Prophet describes what will be the
reformation of the
Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Judgment to the line,
and righteousness to the measure or plummet.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It
is probable that

(<i>kav</i>,) <i>a line</i>, and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tlq&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>mishkoleth</i>,) <i>a plummet</i>, mean the same thing, as may be inferred
with greater certainty from another passage:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"I will stretch over
Jerusalem the rope or line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab."

Kings 21:13.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet I do not deny that he alludes to the examination
of weights; but both metaphors are taken from buildings, in which the
master-builders and masons try everything by a rule, in order to preserve a due
proportion in every part. Thus it is said that the Lord administers equal
judgment, when he restores the Church, in which otherwise everything is
disordered and confused, as in a hideous ruin, when the ungodly are exalted and
enjoy prosperity, while the godly are despised and
sorrowful.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He makes the same statement
concerning "righteousness," that he will measure or try it by his weights, and
will regulate everything by a rule; for by <i>righteousness</i> and
<i>judgment</i> he means a proper and lawful administration of the Church, as
contrasting with the masks and disguises boasted of by those who fear the title
of Bishops. The meaning is, that this foundation is laid, not only that the
Church may be commenced, but that it may be perfectly restored, to use a common
phrase, "from top to bottom" (De fonds en
comble.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The hail shall sweep
away the reliance of falsehood.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This second
part of the metaphor denotes also a very exact equality. Nothing then will be
wanting to the building, if Christ be laid for the foundation; and, on the other
hand, if he be not there, all will be vanity and confusion. Now since there was
no room for "judgment and righteousness," but by sweeping away the false
confidences, he declares that they shall be all swept away, because the violence
of God's anger shall cast down all loftiness, and the flood shall penetrate all
the hiding-places of thoughtless indifference. He therefore threatens that
hypocrites, with all their boasting, shall nevertheless perish, even though the
Lord preserve the Church; for he does not speak of chastisements, as if the
wicked would be corrected by them, because, on the contrary, they become
hardened and more obstinate. The cleansing, therefore, he shews, will be such as
to drag them forth from their hiding-places and strip them of false and empty
confidence; for wicked men think that they are so thoroughly concealed by their
falsehood and deceit, that they shall never feel strokes, and therefore they
please and flatter themselves amidst their iniquities and crimes; but the
<i>waters</i> will easily reach them; that is, the wrath of God, which shall
rush down upon them like a deluge, will easily break through their
lurking-places.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And your covenant with death
shall be disannulled.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Formerly he directed his
reproof against hypocrites, who obstinately mocked at God and all his
threatenings; and he checked their thoughts in imagining that "they had made a
covenant with death," (verse 15,) that is, in promising to themselves that all
their transgressions would pass unpunished; as if by jeers and laughter they
could escape the arm of God. He now threatens that, when they shall be fully
aware that they must render an account to God, they shall be struck with fear
and dread, whether they will or not;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F492</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for that state of ease and indifference into which they are sunk, arises from a
kind of lethargy or drunkenness, which hinders them from perceiving the alarming
nature of their disease; but the Lord will arouse them from their sleep, however
profound, and will annul their imaginary
compacts.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In short, he means that that peace
which the wicked enjoy, while they slumber in their sins, will not be perpetual;
for they shall be compelled, even against their will, to acknowledge that God is
their judge, and, when they shall wish to enjoy repose, and while they are
careless and unprepared, they shall be suddenly seized and agitated by strange
terrors and anguish of mind. Their case is similar to that of malefactors, who,
if they have broken out of prison and escaped, mock their judges, and utter
reproachful and forward and insolent language against them, but, when they see
the officers of justice close at their heels, suddenly tremble, and find that
all their joy is turned into mourning, and that their condition is far worse
than if they had not broken out of prison. Thus the wicked enjoy some momentary
gladness, which they obtain by forgetfulness of their guilt; but the Lord
immediately lays his hand on them, and terrifies their consciences in such a
manner that they can find no rest.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From the time that it shall
pass.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He expresses more in this verse than in
the preceding one; for he declares that the destruction of the reprobate is
close at hand, though they promise to themselves everlasting happiness. Wicked
men indeed perceive that they are liable to many calamities, but yet they
flatter and stupefy themselves, and imagine that in this way they can ward off
their calamities. They have in their mouth proverbs of this sort, "Let us not
distress ourselves before the time: Let us enjoy the season while it lasts: Let
us be cheerful, and not give ourselves uneasiness when we can avoid it." But he
threatens that there hangs over their heads a hidden destruction,

and adds:</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It shall seize you
every morning, and shall pass every day by day and
night.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By "every morning" is meant "quickly and
continually; " for it is only when they feel distress that wicked men are
touched with the fear of God. Frequently indeed they are afraid when there is no
danger; but it is a blind terror, for they do not understand whence their alarm
proceeds. While God threatens, they are unconcerned, because they do not
acknowledge him to be their judge, and thus they have no serious thoughts about
God till they feel his hand. When he again repeats "in the morning," and
afterwards adds, "by day and by night," he means, as I have said, that the
scourge will be constant and daily; that they may not persuade themselves that
it will be a light calamity, or deceive themselves by the hope of any
mitigation; for, while the wrath of God against believers is momentary, against
unbelievers it is eternal, for it never ceases to pursue them to the
end.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Terror alone shall cause
them to understand the report.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F494</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Here commentators differ. Jerome's translation is "Terror shall give
understanding to the report." But they come nearer to the meaning of the Prophet
who give this interpretation, "The report alone shall make you understand," that
is, "The men to whom the messenger shall come will be rendered obedient to God
by the report alone." For my own part, I adopt a simpler view, though I do not
choose to refute the expositions given by others. "It will come to pass that
terror alone shall enable you to understand doctrine." As if he had said,
"Hitherto I have not succeeded in my exhortations to you, but the Lord will find
out a new method of instructing you, that is, chastisements and calamities, by
which he will terrify you in such a manner that you shall know with whom you
have to do." It is as if a grieved and sorrowful father were thus to remonstrate
with a disobedient and incorrigible son, "Since you despise my advices, you must
one day be taught by the executioner."
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F495</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">Thus
Isaiah threatens wicked men, who mocked at all his threatenings, and tells them
that they do not care for the assistance of prophets, but that one day they will
actually know with what sincerity and truth they addressed them, and yet that it
will be of no advantage to them, because knowledge so late will leave no room
for repentance. We must "seek the Lord while there is time."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
55:6.) Pharaoh was made no better by the chastisements which he received,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;020815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
8:15,) and Esau gained nothing by his tears, when he saw that he had been
stripped of his birthright,

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
12:17;) for they were not followed by any repentance or any amendment of life.
By the word "terror" he shews how "dreadful it is to fall into the hands of the
living God,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581031&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
10:31,) and that they who despise his word are never allowed to pass unpunished.
He employs the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h[wm&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>shemugnah</i>) to denote what is heard, that is,
doctrine.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the bed shall be
short.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By this metaphor he adorns the former
statement; for he compares the reprobate, who are pressed down by the hand of
God, to those who have concealed themselves in a "short and narrow bed," in
which they can scarcely stretch their limbs or lift their head, and where, in
short, instead of rest, they feel sharp pains. He means that the Jews will be
shut up in such a manner that they shall be overwhelmed with the severity of
their distresses, and that the "bed," which is given to man for rest, will be an
instrument of torture.</font><br><font face="Palatino">If they seek a
"covering," he says that "it will be too short to wrap themselves in it," and
that it is an addition to their former distress, that amidst those heavy
calamities they will want all necessary comforts. He chose to express this by
the metaphor of a "narrow covering," that they may know that their condition
will be in the highest degree wretched; because the vengeance of God will pursue
them on all sides, both above and below, so that they shall have no abatement or
mitigation, and shall find no relief. The Lord employs these metaphors, in order
to accommodate himself to our weakness; because otherwise we cannot understand
how dreadful is the judgment of God. Hence therefore we learn how dreadful are
the terrors which shake and confine wicked men, when the Lord pursues them; they
search eagerly for places of concealment, and would willingly hide themselves in
the center of the earth; but the Lord drags them forth to light, and confines
and hems them in, so that they cannot
move.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For as in Mount
Perazim.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Since he speaks here of the reprobate,
the Prophet holds out nothing but terrors and cruel punishment; for while the
Lord deals kindly and gently with his children, he shews that he will be an
object of terror to the reprobate. For this purpose he produces examples, in
which the Lord displayed his arm in defense of his people, as when he routed the
Philistines in the valley of Perazim, when David pursued them,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;100520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 5:20;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;131411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Chronicles 14:11,) and at another time, when the Amorites and other enemies were
slain by the Israelites in the valley of Gibeon, with Joshua as their leader, to
wholly the Lord granted that the "sun and moon should stand still," that they
might more easily pursue their enemies.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;061010&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joshua
10:10-14.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall Jehovah rise
up.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By the word "rise up" he points out the
power of God, because we think that he is lazy and indolent, when he does not
punish the reprobate. It is therefore said that he "rises up" or stands erect,
when he openly exhibits to us proofs of his power, and such as especially
manifest the great care which he takes of his Church. Although the manner was
different, (for in ancient times he "rose up" in defense of his chosen people
against foreigners, but now he threatens war against the Jews,) yet Isaiah
skillfully applies these examples; for by driving out internal enemies God will
promote the advantage of his Church not less than if he directed his strength
and arms against foreigners. He would thus reckon them in the number of enemies,
though they falsely boasted that they were his
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His strange
work.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F496</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Some think that this "work" is called "strange," because nothing corresponds
better to the nature of God than to be merciful and to pardon our sins; and that
when he is angry, he acts against his will, and assumes a character that is
foreign to him and that is contrary to his nature. By nature he is gentle,
compassionate, patient, kind, slow to anger, as Scripture declares by many words
and by a variety of expressions his infinite compassion.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;023406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
34:6;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
103:8.) Others explain it to mean that the "work" is "strange," because formerly
he was wont to defend his people, and that it is monstrous that he now proceeds
to attack and exterminate them, as if they were
enemies.</font><br><font face="Palatino">For my own part, I consider "strange"
to mean simply what is uncommon or wonderful; for this appellation is given to
what is rare and unusual among men, and we know that they almost always view
with astonishment whatever is new. It is as if he had said, "The Lord will
punish you, and that not in a common or ordinary way, but in a way so amazing
that at the sight or hearing of it, all shall be struck with horror." It is
certain that all the works of God are so many proofs of his power, so that they
ought justly to excite our admiration; but because, through constant habit and
looking at them, they are despised by us, we think that he does nothing unless
he adopt some extraordinary methods. On this account Isaiah quotes ancient
examples, in order that we may know that, though to men this vengeance be new
and amazing, yet to God it is far from being new, since for a long period he has
given proofs of his power and ability not less remarkable than these. Yet I
willingly admit that the Prophet contrasts the wicked Israelites with the
Philistines and Canaanites, as if he had said, "The Lord formerly performed
miracles when he wished to save his people; he will now perform them in order to
destroy that people; for since the Israelites have degenerated, they shall feel
the hand of God for their destruction which their fathers felt for their
salvation."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now
therefore.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He again reminds those wicked men,
whom he had formerly called "scorners," (verse 14,) that their cunning, and
contempt, and jeers, and mockery, will avail them nothing, because all their
ingenuity will be thwarted; and he exhorts them to repentance, if there still be
any of them that are capable of being cured. For this reason he repeats the same
threatenings, in order to arouse
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lest your chains be more
firmly fastened.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He says that all that they
will gain by resistance will be to draw themselves more firmly into their nets.
Instead of "chains," there are some who render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yrswm</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>moserim</i>) "chastisements;" but this does not agree with the context. The
metaphor of "chains" is highly appropriate in this passage; for, as the fox
which has fallen into a snare, fastens the knot more firmly by his attempts to
extricate himself and escape, so wicked men by their disobedience entangle and
fasten themselves more and more. They desire to escape the hand of God, and kick
against the spur, like an unruly horse which bends all its strength to shake of
its rider; but all that they accomplish by their obstinacy and stubbornness is
to receive heavier and severer
blows.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be ye not
mockers.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This shews us how we ought to deal
with wicked men, when we see that they are altogether destitute of the fear of
God. All that remains for us to do is, to warn them that their jeers and scorn
will be attended by no success in resisting the vengeance of God which hangs
over them. We are also reminded that we ought not to sport with God, since we
see, as in a mirror, what has been the end of those who despised the warnings
and threatenings of the prophets since the beginning of the
world.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I have heard a
consumption.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> That his prediction may be firmly
believed, he declares that he brings nothing forward which God did not reveal.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlk</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>chalah</i>) sometimes signifies "perfection," and sometimes "consumption,"
as we formerly stated
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F497</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;231023&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
10:23.) Here it must denote "consumption," for the Prophet means nothing else
than that God has determined speedily to destroy the whole earth by a general
slaughter. This includes two things; first, that dreadful and grievous
destruction is about to overtake the world, (unless it be thought better to
limit the word "earth" to Judea, to which I do not object,) and, secondly, that
the day is fixed and is not distant. The word <i>hearing</i> is here used to
denote Revelation. He says that it has been made known to him; for, as the Lord
determined to make use of the ministry of the prophets, so he revealed to them
his secrets, that they might be, as it were, interpreters of
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Upon the whole
earth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As if he had said, "The whole world
abounds with shocking impiety, reprobate men have grown wanton in their
wickedness, as if there would be no judgment of God; but throughout the whole
world, or in every part of Judea, God will shew that he is judge and avenger,
and not a corner of the earth will be exempted from troubles and calamities,
because they have despised the word." Now, although these things were revealed
in the age of Isaiah, yet they belong not less to other times, in which God
shews that he is always like himself, and is wont to execute his Judgments by
the same method and rule.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F498</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Give ear and hear my voice.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Isaiah makes use of a preface, as if he were
about to speak of something important and very weighty; for we are not wont to
demand attention from our hearers, unless when we are about to say what is very
important. And yet he seems here to speak of common and ordinary subjects, as
for example, about agriculture, sowing, thrashing, and such like operations. But
the Prophet intended to direct the minds of his hearers to higher matters; for
when he discourses about the judgments of God, and shews with what wisdom God
governs the world, though wicked men think that everything moves by chance and
at random, he intended to lay down and explain a difficult subject, in a plain
style, by metaphors drawn from objects which are well known and understood. We
often complain that God winks too much at the crimes of wicked men, because he
does not immediately punish them agreeably to our wish; but the Prophet shews
that God appoints nothing but what is just and
proper.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The design of this preface therefore is,
that men may perceive their stupidity in carping at the judgments of God, and
putting an unfavourable construction on them, while even in the ordinary course
of nature they have a very bright mirror, in which they may see them plainly.
There is an implied expostulation with men who shut their eyes amidst so clear
light. He shews that they are dull and stupid in not understanding the works of
God which are so manifest, and yet are so rash and daring that they presume to
judge and censure what is hidden. In like manner Paul also, when speaking of the
resurrection, pronounces that those who do not perceive the power of God in the
seeds which are thrown into the earth are madmen.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Thus Isaiah here declares that those who do not see
the wisdom of God in things so obvious are stupid, and, in short, that men are
blind and dull in beholding the works of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
sow?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This passage is commonly explained as if
the Lord reproached his people for ingratitude, because he had cultivated the
field as a husbandman, and had spent on it all his care and industry, and yet
did not reap such fruit as it ought to have yielded. Such is the interpretation
given by the Jews, who have been followed also by the Greek and Latin
commentators; but Isaiah's meaning was quite different. He connects this
doctrine with his former statement, that the destruction of Judea, or of the
whole world, had been revealed to him; and therefore he adds, that still God
does not always display his hand, or constantly punish the wickedness of men;
for he often appears as if he did not see it, and delays the punishment of it
for a time. The Lord's forbearance and slowness to punish, which is thus
manifested, is abused by wicked men for leading them to greater lengths in
wickedness, as Solomon remarks that men are encouraged to commit wickedness by
observing that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"all things happen alike
to the good and to the bad,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;210814&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ecclesiastes
8:14,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">that all the worst and basest men enjoy prosperity,
while the godly are liable to distresses not less and even greater than those of
other men.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F500</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">In
short, when the wicked perceive no difference in outward matters, they think
either that there is no God, or that everything is governed by the blind
violence of fortune. To such thoughts therefore Isaiah replies, "Do you not know
that God has his seasons, and that he knows what he ought to do at the proper
time?" If ploughmen do not "every day" cleave the earth or break the clods, this
ought not to be attributed to their want of skill; for, on the contrary, their
skill requires them to desist.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F501</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
What would they gain by continually turning over the soil, but to weary
themselves to no purpose, and prevent it from yielding any fruit? Thus God does
not act with bustle or confusion, but knows the times and seasons for doing his
work.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F502</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When he hath levelled its
surface.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now speaks about sowing. The sower
will not put into the earth as much as he can, nor will he throw it in at
random, but will measure the ground, and give to it as much as is necessary; for
otherwise the superfluous mass would rot, and not a single grain would take
root.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wheat in measure, and
barley measured.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F503</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He will not mix various seeds, but will allot one part of the field for "wheat,"
another for "vetches," and another for "cummin." He will do this in measure, for
that I consider to be the proper interpretation of
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrw&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>sorah</i>.)
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F504</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It does not mean excellent or good; for he is speaking about measurement.
Similar statements are made about reaping and thrashing; for all kinds of grain
are not thrashed in the same manner. Wheat is thrashed with the wheel of a cart
or wagon, vetches with a staff, and cummin with a thicker rod. He speaks
according to the custom of the country. This mode of thrashing is unknown in any
part of France, except Provence.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F505</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In short, he means that the manner of thrashing which is suitable to the grain
does not apply equally to all. Besides, the husbandman is not constantly or
incessantly employed in thrashing, but exercises moderation, that he may not
bruise the grain.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His God instructeth and teacheth
him what is right. </i></font><font face="Palatino">From whom did the husbandman
learn these things but from God? If they are so well educated and taught in the
smallest matters, what ought we to think of so great a teacher and instructor?
Does he not know how to apply a fixed measure and equity to his works? Does he
not see the time for executing his judgment; when he ought to cut down the
people, and, as we may say, to harrow
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F506</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
them; when he ought to thrash; what strokes, what kind of chastisements he ought
to inflict; in short, what is most suitable to each time and to each person?
Will not he who appointed the universal order of nature regulate these things
also by a just proportion? Are men so headstrong that they will venture to
remonstrate with him, or to impugn his wisdom? The general meaning is, that we
ought not to judge rashly, if God does not immediately punish the wickedness of
men.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This shews that we ought to restrain the
presumption of men, who, even in the smallest matters, often fall into mistakes.
If a person ignorant of agriculture should see a husbandman cutting fields with
a plough, making furrows, breaking clods, driving oxen up and down and following
their footsteps, he would perhaps laugh at it, imagining that it was childish
sport; but that man would be justly blamed by the husbandman, and convicted of
ignorance and rashness; for every person of great modesty will think that those
things are not done idly or at random, though he does not know the reason. When
the seed is committed to the ground, does it not appear to be lost? If ignorant
men find fault with these things, as ignorance is often rash and presumptuous in
judging, will not intelligent men justly blame and pronounce them to have been
in the wrong? If this be the case, how shall the Lord deal with us, if we dare
to find fault with his works which we do not
understand?</font><br><font face="Palatino">Let us therefore learn from this how
carefully we ought to avoid this rashness, and with what modesty we ought to
restrain ourselves from such thoughts. If we ought to act modestly towards men,
and not to condemn rashly what exceeds our understanding or capacity, we ought
to exercise much greater modesty towards God. When we consider therefore the
various calamities with which the Church is afflicted, let us not complain that
loose reins are given to the wicked,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F507</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and that consequently she is abandoned to her fate, or that all is over with
her; but let us believe firmly, that the Lord will apply remedies at the proper
time, and let us embrace with our whole heart his righteous
judgments.</font><br><font face="Palatino">If any person carefully examining
those words shall infer from them that some are punished more speedily and
others more slowly, and shall pronounce the meaning to be, that punishment is
delayed, such a view is not merely probable, but is fully expressed by the
Prophet. We draw from it a delightful consolation, that the Lord regulates his
thrashing in such a manner that he does not crush or bruise his people. The
wicked are indeed reduced by him to nothing and destroyed; but he chastises his
own people, in order that, having been subdued and cleansed, they may be
gathered into the barn.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This also hath proceeded from
Jehovah of hosts.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This passage is explained by
some, as if The Prophet had said that the science of agriculture proceeded from
the Lord; but I consider it to be the application of what goes before. Having
pointed out the wisdom of God, even in the smallest matters, he bids us, in like
manner, raise our eyes to higher subjects, that we may learn to behold with
greater reverence his wonderful and hidden judgments. A passing observation on
the 26th verse may be made, and indeed ought to be made, that not only
agriculture, but likewise all the arts which contribute to the advantage of
mankind, are the gifts of God, and that all that belongs to skillful invention
has been imparted by him to the minds of men. Men have no right to be proud on
this account, or to arrogate to themselves the praise of invention, as we see
that the ancients did, who, out of their ingratitude to God, ranked in the
number of the gods those whom they considered to be the authors of any ingenious
contrivance. Hence arose deification and that prodigious multitude of gods which
the heathens framed in their own fancy. Hence arose the great Ceres, and
Triptolemus, and Mercury, and innumerable others, celebrated by human tongues
and by human writings. The Prophet shews that such arts ought to be ascribed to
God, from whom they have been received, who alone is the inventor and teacher of
them. If we ought to form such an opinion about agriculture and mechanical arts,
what shall we think of the learned and exalted sciences, such as Medicine,
Jurisprudence, Astronomy, Geometry, Logic, and such like? Shall we not much more
consider them to have proceeded from God? Shall we not in them also behold and
acknowledge his goodness, that his praise and glory may be celebrated both in
the smallest and in the greatest affairs?</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b> This appears to be another discourse, in
which Isaiah threatens the city of Jerusalem. He calls it "Altar,"
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F508</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because the chief defense of the city was in the "Altar;"
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F509</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for although the citizens relied on other bulwarks, of which they had great
abundance, still they placed more reliance on the Temple
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240704&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
7:4) and the altar than on the other defences. While they thought that they were
invincible in power and resources, they considered their strongest and most
invincible fortress to consist in their being defended by the protection of God.
They concluded that God was with them, so long as they enjoyed the altar and the
sacrifices. Some think that the temple is here called "Ariel," from the
resemblance which it bore to the shape of a lion, being broader in front and
narrower behind; but I think it better to take it simply as denoting "the
Altar," since Ezekiel also
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;264315&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
43:15) gives it this name. This prediction is indeed directed against the whole
city, but we must look at the design of the Prophet; for he intended to strip
the Jews of their foolish confidence in imagining that God would assist them, so
long as the altar and the sacrifices could remain, in which they falsely
gloried, and thought that they had fully discharged their duty, though their
conduct was base and
detestable.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The city where
David dwelt.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now proceeds to the city, which
he dignifies with the commendation of its high rank, on the ground of having
been formerly inhabited by David, but intending, by this admission, to scatter
the smoke of their vanity. Some understand by it the lesser Jerusalem, that is,
the inner city, which also was surrounded by a wall; for there was a sort of
two-fold Jerusalem, because it had increased, and had extended its walls beyond
where they originally stood; but I think that this passage must be understood to
relate to the whole city. He mentions <i>David</i>, because they gloried in his
name, and boasted that the blessing of God continually dwelt in his palace; for
the Lord had promised that "the kingdom of David would be for ever."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;100713&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 7:13;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;198937&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
89:37.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we may infer how absurdly the
Papists, in the present day, consider the Church to be bound to Peter's chair,
as if God could nowhere find a habitation in the whole world but in the See of
Rome. We do not now dispute whether Peter was Bishop of the Church of Rome or
not; but though we should admit that this is fully proved, was any promise made
to Rome such as was made to Jerusalem? "This is my rest for ever: here will I
dwell, for I have chosen it."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
132:14.) And if even this were granted, do not we see what Isaiah declares about
Jerusalem? That God is driven from it, when there is no room for doctrine, when
the worship of God is corrupted. What then shall be said of Rome, which has no
testimony? Can she boast of anything in preference to Jerusalem? If God
pronounces a curse on the most holy city, which he had chosen in an especial
manner, what must we say of the rest, who have overturned his holy laws and all
godly institutions.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Add year
to year.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This was added by the Prophet, because
the Jews thought that they had escaped punishment, when any delay was granted to
them. Wicked men think that God has made a truce with them, when they see no
destruction close at hand; and therefore they promise to themselves unceasing
prosperity, so long as the Lord permits them to enjoy peace and quietness. In
opposition to this assurance of their safety the Prophet threatens that, though
they continue to "offer sacrifices,"
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F510</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and though they renew them year by year, still the Lord will execute his
vengeance. We ought to learn from this, that, when the Lord delays to punish and
to take vengeance, we ought not, on that account, to seize the occasion for
delaying our repentance; for although he spares and bears with us for a time,
our sin is not therefore blotted out, nor have we any reason to promise that we
shall make a truce with him. Let us not then abuse his patience, but let us be
more eager to obtain pardon.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But I will bring Ariel into
distress</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I think that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>vau</i>) should here be taken for a disjunctive conjunction: "And yet I will
execute my judgments and take vengeance, though, by delaying them for a time, it
may seem as if I had forgiven." He next threatens that he will give them
<i>grief</i> and <i>mourning</i>, instead of the joy of the festivals.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hyna</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>aniah</i>) is viewed by some as an adjective,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F511</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but improperly; for it is used in the same manner by Jeremiah.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F512</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;250205&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Lamentations
2:5.) He declares that the Lord will reduce that city to straits, that the Jews
might know that they had to contend with God, and not with men, and that, though
the war was carried on by the Assyrians, still they might perceive that God was
their leader.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall be
to me as Ariel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This clause would not apply to
the Temple alone; for he means that everything shall be made bloody by the
slaughter which shall take place at Jerusalem;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F513</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and therefore he compares it to an "Altar," on which victims of all kinds are
slain, in the same manner as wicked men destined for slaughter are frequently
compared to a sacrifice. In short, by alluding here to the word "Altar," he
says, that the whole city shall be "as Ariel," because it shall overflow with
the blood of the slain. Hence it is evident that the outward profession of
worship, ceremonies, and the outward demonstrations of the favor of God, are of
no avail, unless we sincerely obey him. By an ironical expression he tells
hypocrites, (who with an impure heart present sacrifices of beasts to God, as if
they were the offerings fitted to appease his anger,) that their labor is
fruitless, and that, since they had profaned the Temple and the Altar, it was
impossible to offer a proper sacrifice to God without slaying victims throughout
the whole city, as if he had said, "There will be carnage in every part." He
makes use of the word "Sacrifice" figuratively, to denote the violent slaughter
of those who refused to offer themselves willingly to
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will camp against thee
round about.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwdk</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>kaddur</i>)
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F514</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he alludes to the roundness of a ball; and the expression corresponds to one
commonly used, ("Je l'environneray,") "I shall surround it." Thus he shews that
all means of escape will be cut
off.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And will lay siege
against thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This alludes to another method of
invading the city; for either attacks are made at various points, or there is a
regular siege. He confirms the doctrine of the former verse, and shews that this
war will be carried on under God's direction, and that the Assyrians, though
they are hurried on by their passions and by the lust of power, will undertake
nothing but by the command of God. He reckoned it to be of great importance to
carry full conviction to the minds of the Jews, that all the evils which befell
them were sent by God, that they might thus be led to enter into an examination
of their crimes. As this doctrine is often found in the Scriptures, it ought to
be the more carefully impressed on our minds; for it is not without good reason
that it is so frequently repeated and inculcated by the Holy
Spirit.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then shalt thou be laid
low.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He describes scornfully that arrogance
which led the Jews to despise all threatenings and admonitions, so long as they
enjoyed prosperity, as is customary with all hypocrites. He says therefore,
that, when their pride has been laid aside, they will afterwards be more
submissive; not that they will change their dispositions, but because shame will
restrain that wantonness in which they formerly indulged. We ought therefore to
supply here an implied contrast. He addresses those who were puffed up by
ambition, carried their heads high, and despised every one, as if they had not
even been subject to God; for they ventured to curse and insult God himself, and
to mock at his holy word. "This pride," says Isaiah, "shall be laid low, and
this arrogance shall
cease."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thy voice shalt be
out of the ground.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F515</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
What he had formerly said he expresses more fully by a metaphor, that they will
utter a low and confused noise as out of caverns.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F516</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The voice of those who formerly were so haughty and fierce is compared by him to
the speech <i>of soothsayers</i>, who, in giving forth their oracles out of some
deep and dark cave under ground, uttered some sort of confused muttering; for
they did not speak articulately, but whispered. He declares that these boasters
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajla&gt;zonev</font><font face="Palatino">)
shall resemble them. Some interpret this expression as if the Prophet meant that
they will derive no benefit from the chastisement; but the words do not convey
this meaning, and he afterwards says that the Jews will be brought to
repentance. Yet he first strikes terror, in order to repress their insolence;
for they arrogantly and rebelliously scorned all the threatenings of the
Prophet. By their being "brought down," therefore, he means nothing else than
that they shall be covered with disgrace, so that they will not dare to utter,
as from a lofty place, their proud and idle
boastings.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And as the small
dust.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F517</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
I shall first state the opinions of others, and afterwards I shall bring forward
what I consider to be more probable. Almost all the commentators think that this
expression denotes the enemies of the Jews; for they consider "foreigners" to
mean "enemies," and allege that the multitude of those who shall oppress the
Jews shall be "like dust;" that is, it shall be innumerable. But when I examine
closely the whole passage, I am more disposed to adopt a contrary opinion. I
think that the Prophet speaks contemptuously of the garrisons on which the Jews
foolishly relied, for they had in their pay foreign soldiers who were strong
men.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The multitude of the
mighty ones.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Such is the interpretation which I
give to
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yxyr[</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>gnaritzim</i>), which is also its literal meaning; and I see no reason why
some of the Jews should suppose it to mean ungodly or wicked persons. Since,
therefore, the Jews brought various garrisons from a distance, they thought that
they were well defended, and dreaded no danger. The Prophet threatens that their
subsidiary troops, though they were a vast multitude, shall in vain create a
disturbance, for they shall be like "dust" or "chaff," that is, useless refuse,
for they shall produce no effect.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F518</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Hence we ought to infer, that our wealth and resources, however great they are,
shall be reduced to nothing, as soon as the Lord shall determine to deal with us
as he has a right to do. The assistance of men lasts indeed for a time; but when
the Lord shall lift up his hand in earnest, their strength must crumble down,
and they must become like
chaff.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall be in a
moment suddenly.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some explain the concluding
clause of this verse to mean, that the noise of the enemies' attack shall spring
up suddenly, and, as it were, in a moment. But I consider
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jyhw</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>vehayah</i>,) <i>and it shall be</i>, to relate to the time of duration,
which he declares will be momentary; that is, those military aids shall not last
long, but shall quickly vanish away.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F519</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In vain do men boast of them, for God is their
enemy.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From Jehovah of hosts shalt thou
be visited.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He next assigns the reason why all
this multitude of garrisons shall be "like chaff;" and he expresses this by an
opposite metaphor, for with those soldiers he contrasts the anger and
"visitation of the Lord." What is "chaff" to the flame of "a devouring fire?"
What is "dust" to the force and violence of a "whirlwind?" He shews that the
vengeance of God will be such as all their preparations shall be unable to
resist. This meaning, in my opinion, makes the passage to flow easily, and the
clauses will not be so well adjusted, if we follow a different
interpretation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we learn that those who
assail us can do no more than what the Lord permits them to do. If therefore the
Lord determine to save us, the enemies will accomplish nothing, though they
raise up the whole world against us. On the other hand, if he determine to
chastise us, we shall not be able to ward off his wrath by any force or
bulwarks, which shall quickly be thrown down as by a "whirlwind," and shall even
be consumed as by "a flame."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As a dream of a
night-vision.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This verse also I interpret
differently from others; for they think that the Prophet intended to bring
consolation to the godly. There is undoubtedly great plausibility in this view,
and it contains an excellent doctrine, namely, that the enemies of the Church
resemble "dreamers" in this respect, that the Lord disappoints their hopes, even
when they think that they have almost gained their object.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F520</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But this interpretation does not appear to me to agree well with the text.
Sometimes it happens that, when a sentence is beautiful, it attracts us to it,
and causes us to steal away from the true meaning, so that we do not adhere
closely to the context, or spend much time in investigating the author's
meaning. Let us therefore inquire if this be the true meaning of the
Prophet.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Since he afterwards proceeds again to
utter threatenings, I have no doubt that here he follows out the same subject,
which otherwise would be improperly broken off by the present statement. He
censures the Jews, and rebukes them for their obstinacy, in boldly despising God
and all his threatenings. In short, by a most appropriate metaphor, he reproves
them for their false confidence and presumption, when he threatens that the
enemies shall arrive suddenly and unexpectedly, while the Jews shall imagine
that they are enjoying profound peace, and are very far from all danger; and
that the event shall be so sudden and unexpected, that it will appear to be "a
dream." "Although then," says he, "thou indulgest the hope of uninterrupted
repose, the Lord will quickly awake thee, and will drive away thy
presumption."</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet says wittily, that the
Jews are "dreaming," because, in consequence of being drowned in their
pleasures, they neither see nor feel anything, but, amidst the dizzy whirl,
stupidly fancy that they are happy. Hence he infers that the enemies will come,
as in "a dream," to strike terror into those who are asleep, as it frequently
happens that a pleasant and delightful sleep is disturbed by frightful dreams.
It follows from this, that the pleasures which have lulled them to sleep will be
of no advantage to them; for, though they do not at all think of it, yet a
tumult will arise suddenly. This might still have been somewhat obscure, if he
had not explained the subject more fully in the following
verse.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It shall be therefore as when a
hungry man dreameth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He compares the Jews to
"hungry men," who are indeed asleep, but whose empty stomach craves for food;
for it is natural for men to dream about food and entertainment when they are in
want of them. Thus, while the Jews watched, they were like "hungry men." The
Lord continually warned them by his prophets, and invited them to the divine
feasts of the word; but they despised those feasts, and chose rather to take
refuge wholly in their vices, and to fall asleep in them, than to partake fully
of those sacred feasts. According]y, while they quieted their consciences, they
imagined that they had abundance of all things, and that they were free from
every inconvenience. Isaiah declares that they greatly resemble this "dream" and
airy "vision;" for, when they have been aroused by a sudden calamity, they shall
feel how empty and insubstantial those "dreams and visions" were, and how false
and delusive was the opinion which they had formed that they enjoyed abundance.
As "hungry men," who have had such dreams, are rendered more feeble by them, so
the people, who had been falsely persuaded that everything was going on well
with them, will endure much greater uneasiness than if they had never cherished
in their minds such a thought, but, on the contrary, had been aware of their
poverty and nakedness.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So
shall be the multitude.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> At first sight, the
expression appears to be harsh, when he says, "The multitude of those who fight
against Ariel shall be as a dream;" but it ought to be explained in this manner:
&#8212; "When the Jews, through false hope, shall promise to themselves
deliverance, as if the enemies would be driven far away, they shall quickly feel
that they had been deceived; in the same manner as a person whom hunger leads to
dream that he is feasting luxuriously, as soon as he awakes, feels that his
hunger is keener than before." I see nothing here, therefore, that is fitted to
yield consolation, for the Prophet pursues the same subject, and exclaims
against the scorn and rebellion of the Jews, on whom the Prophet could make no
impression by exhortation or threatenings.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F521</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Tarry and wonder.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Isaiah follows out the same subject, and
attacks more keenly the gross stupidity of the people. Instead of "tarry," some
render the term, "Be amazed;" but the view which I prefer may be thus expressed:
"Though they dwell much and long on this thought, yet it will end in nothing
else than that, by long continued thought, their minds shall be amazed." In
short, he means that the judgment of God will so completely overwhelm their
minds, that though they torture themselves by thinking and reflecting, still
they will be unable to find any outlet or
conclusion.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They are drunken,
and not with wine.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now assigns the reason
why fixed thought does not aid them in conquering their slowness of
apprehension. It is, because they resemble <i>drunkards</i>. When, therefore,
they neither see nor understand anything in the works of God, he shews that this
is owing to their indolence and stupidity. A proof of this is given daily in
many persons; for spiritual "drunkenness" engrosses and stupefies all their
senses to such a degree, that they are blind to the plainest subjects; and, when
God shews the brightest light of justice and equity, they are so completely
dazzled, that their dim vision bewilders them more and more. This stupidity is a
just punishment which the Lord inflicts on them on account of their
unbelief.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In order that we may apply this
statement of the Prophet for our own use, it is proper to observe, that these
words of the Prophet must not be understood to be commands, as if he enjoined
them to stop and think longer; but, on the contrary, he mocks and reproves their
stupidity, as we have already said. (Pensez y tant que vous voudrez, vous n'y
entendres rien) "Think as much as you please about it, you will not at all
understand it."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They are
blinded, and they blind.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F522</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He means, that they are destitute of judgment and understanding, and that
consequently it is useless for them to contemplate these works of God; for as
the brightness of the sun is of no avail to the toad, so a blinded understanding
in vain does its utmost to comprehend the majestic works of God. When he says
that "they are blinded," he means that by nature we are created so as to be
endued with reason and understanding for contemplating the works of God; that
our being "blinded" is, so to speak, an accidental fault, and that the
drunkenness does not naturally belong to us, for it is owing to the ingratitude
of men, which the Lord justly
censures.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
stagger.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This "staggering" of the mind is
contrasted by him with a calm and quiet exercise of reason; for he means that
violence of the passions which agitates the mind, and causes it to waver and
reel.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because Jehovah hath overpowered
you with the spirit of slumber.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> For the purpose
of shewing more clearly the source of this blindness, he attributes it to the
judgment of God, who determined to punish in this manner the wickedness of the
people. As it belongs to him to give eyes to see, and to enlighten minds by the
spirit of judgment and understanding, so he alone deprives us of all light, when
he sees that by a wicked and depraved hatred of the truth we of our own accord
wish for darkness. Accordingly, when men are blind, and especially in things so
plain and obvious, we perceive his righteous
judgment.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Your prophets and
principal seers.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F523</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He adds, that the people are deprived of those aids and helps which ought to
have imparted light to the understanding and given direction to others.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F524</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Such was the office of the prophets, whom he describes by both of these names,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yaybn</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>nebiim</i>,) and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yzj</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>chozim</i>,) "prophets" and "seers." In short, he means not only that men
who are endued with reason and understanding will be deprived of common sense,
but that their teachers also, whose duty it was to enlighten others, will be
altogether senseless so as not to know the road, and, being covered with the
darkness of ignorance, will shamefully go astray, and will be so far from
directing others that they will not even be able to guide
themselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore every vision hath
become to you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet expresses still more
clearly what he had formerly said, that the blindness of the Jews will be so
great that, though the Lord enlightens them by the clearest light of his word,
they will understand nothing. Nor does he mean that this will happen to the
common people alone, but even to the rulers and teachers, who ought to have been
wiser than others, and to have held out an example to them.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F524A</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In short, he means that this stupidity will pervade all ranks; for both "learned
and unlearned," he declares, will be so dull and stupid as to be altogether
dazzled by the word of God, and to see no more in it than in a "sealed letter."
He makes the same statement, but in different words, which he had made in the
former chapter, that the Lord will be to them as "precept upon precept, line
upon line;" for they will always remain in the first rudiments, and will never
arrive at solid doctrine.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;232813&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
28:13.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the same sense he now shews that,
from the highest to the lowest, they will derive no benefit from the word of
God. He does not say that doctrine will be taken away, but that, though it be in
their possession, they will not have reason and understanding. In two ways the
Lord punishes the wickedness of men; for sometimes he takes away entirely the
use of the word, and sometimes, when he leaves it, he takes away understanding,
and blinds the minds of men, so that "seeing they do not see."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
6:9.) First, therefore, he deprives them of reading, either by taking away the
books through the tyranny of wicked men, as frequently happens, or by a false
conviction of men, which leads them to think that the books were not delivered
to be read universally by all. Secondly, although he allows them to handle and
read the books, yet, because men abuse them, and are ungrateful, and do not look
straight to the glory of God, they are blinded, and see no more than if not a
single ray of the word had shone upon them. We must not boast, therefore, of the
outward preaching of the word; for it will be of no avail unless it produce its
fruit by enlightening our minds. It is as if he had
said,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"On account of that covenant
which he made with your fathers, the Lord will leave to you the tables of that
covenant; but they shall be to you 'a sealed letter,' for you shall learn
nothing from them."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050420&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
4:20, 37; 7:6.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">When we see that these things
happened to the Jews, as Isaiah threatened, and when we take into view the
condition of that people, which God had adopted and separated, it is impossible
that we should not altogether tremble at such dreadful vengeance. Though they
had been instructed both by the law and by the prophets, and had been
enlightened by a light of surpassing brightness, yet they fell into frightful
superstitions and shocking impiety; the worship of God was corrupted, all
religion was scattered and overthrown, and they were rent and divided into
various and monstrous sects. At length, when the Sadducees, the most wicked of
them all, held the chief power, when all faith and all hope of a resurrection,
and even of immortality, had been taken away, what, I ask, could they resemble
but cattle or swine? for what is left to man if the hope of a blessed and
eternal life be taken from him?</font><br><font face="Palatino">And yet the
Evangelists
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402223&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;442308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
23:8) plainly tell us that there were such persons when Christ came; for at that
time these things were actually fulfilled, as they had been foretold by the
Prophet, that we may know that these threatening were not thrown out at random
or by chance, and that they did not fail of accomplishment, because at that time
they were obstinately and rebelliously despised and scorned by wicked men. At
that time, therefore, both their unbelief and their folly were clearly seen,
when the true light was revealed to the whole world, that is, Christ, the only
light of truth, the soul of the law, the end of all the prophets. At that time,
I say, there was, in an especial manner, placed before the eyes of the Jews
"that vail which was shadowed out in Moses,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;023430&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
34:30,) whom they could not look at on account of his excessive brightness; and
it was actually fulfilled in Christ, to whom it belonged, as Paul tells us, to
take away and destroy that vail.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 3:16.) Till now, therefore, the vail lies on their hearts when they
read Moses; for they reject Christ, to whom Moses ought to be viewed as related.
In that passage "Moses" must be viewed as denoting the law; and if it be
referred to its end, that is, to Christ, that vail will be taken
away.</font><br><font face="Palatino">While we contemplate these judgments of
God, let us also acknowledge, that he who was formerly the Judge is still the
Judge, and that the same vengeance is prepared for those who shall refuse to
lend their ear to his most holy warnings. When he expressly names the "learned
and unlearned,"
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F525</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
it ought to be observed, that we do not understand spiritual doctrine, in
consequence of possessing an acute understanding, or having received a superior
education in the schools. Learning did not prevent them from being blinded. We
ought, therefore, to embrace the word sincerely and earnestly, if we wish to
escape this vengeance, which is threatened not only against the ignorant but
also against the "learned."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore the Lord saith.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet shews that the Lord, in acting with
such severity towards his people, will proceed on the most righteous grounds;
though it was a severe and dreadful chastisement that their minds should be
stupefied by the hand of God.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F526</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Now, since men are so fool-hardy and obstinate, that they do not hesitate to
contend with him, as if he were unjustly severe, the Prophet shews that God has
acted the part of a righteous judge, and that the blame lies wholly on men, who
have provoked him by their baseness and
wickedness.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because this
people draweth near with their mouth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He shews
that the people have deserved this punishment chiefly on account of their
hypocrisy and superstitions. When he says that "they draw near with the
<i>mouth</i> and the <i>lips</i>," he describes their hypocrisy. This is the
interpretation which I give to
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;gn</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>nagash</i>,) and it appears to me to be the more probable reading, though
some are of a different opinion. Some translate it, "to be compelled," and
others, "to magnify themselves;" but the word contrasted with it, <i>to
remove,</i>
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F527</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which he afterwards employs, shews plainly that the true reading is that which
is most generally
received.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And their fear
toward me hath been taught by the precept of
men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By these words he reproves their
superstitious and idolatrous practices. These two things are almost always
joined together; and not only so, but hypocrisy is never free from ungodliness
or superstition; and, on the other hand, ungodliness or superstition is never
free from hypocrisy. By the <i>mouth</i> and <i>lips</i> he means an outward
profession, which belongs equally to the good and the bad; but they differ in
this respect, that bad men have nothing but idle ostentation, and think that
they have done all that is required, if they open their lips in honor of God;
but good men, out of the deepest feeling of the heart, present themselves before
God, and, while they yield their obedience, confess and acknowledge how far they
are from a perfect discharge of their duty.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Thus
he makes use of a figure of speech, very frequent in Scripture, by which one
part or class denotes the whole. He has selected a class exceedingly appropriate
and suitable to the present subject, for it is chiefly by the tongue and the
mouth that the appearance of piety is assumed. Isaiah therefore includes, also,
the other parts by which hypocrites counterfeit and deceive, for in every way
they are inclined to lies and falsehood. We ought not to seek a better expositor
than Christ himself, who, in speaking of the washing of the hands, which the
Pharisees regarded as a manifestation of holiness, and which they blamed the
disciples for neglecting, in order to convict them of hypocrisy,
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Well hath Isaiah
prophesied of you, This people honoureth me with the lips, but their heart is
far from
me."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401507&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
15:7, 8.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With the "lips" and "mouth," therefore, the Prophet
contrasts the "heart," the sincerity of which God enjoins and demands from us.
If this be wanting, all our works, whatever brilliancy they possess, are
rejected by him; for "he is a Spirit," and therefore chooses to be "worshipped"
and adored by us "with the spirit" and the heart.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430424&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
4:24.) If we do not begin with this, all that men profess by outward gestures
and attitudes will be empty display. We may easily conclude from this what value
ought to be set on that worship which Papists think that they render to God,
when they worship God by useless ringing of bells, mumbling, wax candles,
incense, splendid dresses, and a thousand trifles of the same sort; for we see
that God not only rejects them, but even holds them in
abhorrence.</font><br><font face="Palatino">On the second point, when God is
worshipped by inventions of men, he condemns this "fear" as superstitious,
though men endeavor to cloak it under a plausible pretense of religion, or
devotion, or reverence. He assigns the reason, that it "hath been taught by
men." I consider
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hdmlm</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>melummadah</i>)
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F528</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to have a passive signification; for he means, that to make "the commandments of
men," and not the word of God, the rule of worshipping him, is a subversion of
all order.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F529</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But it is the will of the Lord, that our "fear," and the reverence with which we
worship him, shall be regulated by the rule of his word; and he demands nothing
so much as simple obedience, by which we shall conform ourselves and all our
actions to the rule of the word, and not turn aside to the right hand or to the
left.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence it is sufficiently evident, that
those who learn from "the inventions of men" how they should worship God, not
only are manifestly foolish, but wear themselves out by destructive toil,
because they do nothing else than provoke God's anger; for he could not testify
more plainly than by the tremendous severity of this chastisement, how great is
the abhorrence with which he regards false worship. The flesh reckons it to be
improper that God should not only reckon as worthless, but even punish severely,
the efforts of those who, through ignorance and error, weary themselves in
attempts to appease God; but we ought not to wonder if he thus maintains his
authority. Christ himself explains this passage, saying, "In vain do they
worship one, teaching doctrines, the commandments of men."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401509&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
15:9.) Some have chosen to add a conjunction, "teaching doctrines <i>and</i>
commandments of men," as if the meaning had not been sufficiently clear. But he
evidently means something different, namely, that we act absurdly when we follow
"the commandments of men" for our doctrine and rule of
life.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore, behold, I add to
do.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F530</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He threatens that he will punish by blinding not only the ignorant or the
ordinary ranks, but those wise men who were held in admiration by the people.
From this vengeance we may easily learn how hateful a vice hypocrisy is, and how
greatly it is abhorred by God, as the Prophet spoke a little before about human
inventions; for what kind of punishment is more dreadful than blindness of mind
and stupidity? This indeed is not commonly perceived by men, nor are they aware
of the greatness of this evil; but it is the greatest and most wretched of
all.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the wisdom of their
wise men shall perish.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He does not speak of the
common herd of men, but of their very leaders, who ought to have been like eyes.
The common people in themselves are blind, like the other members of the body;
and when the eyes are blinded, what shall become of the rest of the body? "If
the light be darkness," as Christ asks, "how great shall be the darkness!" This
is added in order to place that vengeance in a more striking
light.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence also, we may infer how vain and
foolish is the boasting of the Papists, who think that they have shut the mouths
of all men, when they have brought forward the name of Bishops, or other titles
of the same kind, such as Doctors, or Pastors, or the Apostolic See. They have
perhaps a different kind of wisdom from that which was possessed by the Jews;
but whence did they derive it? They pretend that it came from God; but we see
that the Prophet does not speak of the wise men of the Chaldeans or Egyptians,
but of the order of priesthood which God had appointed, of the teachers, and
chief rulers, and ensign bearers, of the chosen people and of the only Church;
for under this term "wise men," he includes all superior excellence and
authority among the people.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Woe to them that conceal
themselves from Jehovah. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet again
exclaims against those wicked and profane despisers of God, whom he formerly
called
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yxl</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>letzim</i>,) "scorners," who think that they have no other way of being wise
than to be skillful in mocking God. They regard religion as foolish simplicity,
and hide themselves in their cunning, as in a labyrinth; and on this account
they mock at warnings and threatenings, and, in short, at the whole doctrine of
godliness. From this verse it is sufficiently evident that the pestilence, which
afterwards spread more widely, prevailed even at that time in the world, namely,
that hypocrites delighted in mocking inwardly at God, and in despising
prophecies. The Prophet therefore exclaims against them, and calls them
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yqym[m</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>magnamikim</i>,) that is, "diggers,"
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F531</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as if they "dug" for themselves concealment and lurking-places, that by means of
them they might deceive
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they may hide
counsel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This clause is added for the sake of
exposition. Some interpret the beginning of this verse, as if the Prophet
condemned that excessive curiosity by which some men, with excess of hardihood,
search into the secret judgments of God. But that interpretation cannot be
admitted; and the Prophet plainly shews to whom he refers, when he immediately
adds the mockeries of those who thought that their wickedness was committed in a
manner so secret and concealed, that they could not be detected. The "hiding of
counsel" means nothing else than hardihood in wickedness, by which wicked men
surround themselves with clouds, and obscure the light, that their inward
baseness may not be seen. Hence arises that daring question
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who seeth
us?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> For, although they professed to be
worshippers of God, yet they thought that, by their sophistry, they had
succeeded not only in refuting the prophets, but in overturning the judgment of
God; not openly, indeed, for even wicked men wish to retain some semblance of
religion, that they may more effectually deceive, but in their heart they
acknowledge no God but the god which they have contrived. This craftiness,
therefore, in which wicked men delight and flatter themselves, is compared by
Isaiah to a hiding-place, or to coverings. They think that they are covered with
a veil, so that not even God himself can see and punish their wickedness. As
rulers are principally chargeable with this vice, it is chiefly to them, in my
opinion, that the Prophet's reproof is directed; for they do not think that they
have sufficient acuteness or dexterity, if they do not scoff at God, and despise
his doctrine, and, in short, believe no more than what they choose. They do not
venture to reject it altogether, or rather, they are constrained, against their
will, to hold by some religion; but they do so only as far as they think that
they can promote their own convenience, and are not moved by any fear of the
true God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">At the present day this wickedness has
been abundantly manifested, and especially since the gospel was revealed. Under
Popery men found it easy to transact with God, because the Pope had contrived a
god who changed himself so as to suit the disposition of every individual. Every
person had a different method of washing away his sins, and many kinds of
worship for appeasing his deity. Consequently, none ought to wonder that
wickedness was not seen at that time, for it was concealed by coverings of that
sort; and when these had been taken away, men declared openly what they had
formerly been. Yet not less common in our age is the disease which Isaiah
bewailed in his nation; for men think that they can conceal themselves from God,
when they have interposed their ingenious contrivances, as if "all things were
not naked and open to his eyes,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580413&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
4:13,) or as if any man could deceive or be concealed from him. For this reason
he says, by way of explanation
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For their works are in
darkness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He assigns this as the cause of that
foolish confidence by which ungodly men are intoxicated. Though they are
surrounded by light, they are so slow of perception, that when they do not see
it, they endeavor to flee from the presence of God. They even promise to
themselves full escape from punishment, and commit sin with as much freedom as
if they had been protected and fortified on all sides against God. Such is the
import of their question, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who
seeth us?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Not that wicked men ventured openly
to utter these words, as we have said, but because they thus spoke or thus
thought in their hearts, which was manifested by their presumption and vain
confidence. They abandoned themselves to all wickedness, and despised all
warnings, in such a manner as if there would never be a judgment of God. The
Prophet, therefore, had to do with ungodly men, who in appearance and name
professed to have some knowledge of God, but in reality denied him, and were
very bitter enemies of pure doctrine. Now, this is nothing else than to affirm
that God is not a Judge, and to cast him down from his seat and tribunal; for
God cannot be acknowledged without doctrine; and where that is set aside and
rejected, God himself must be set aside and
rejected.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is your turning reckoned like
potter's clay!</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There are various ways of
explaining this verse, and, indeed, there is some difficulty on account of the
two particles,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;a</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>im</i>) and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>ki</i>).
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;a</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>im</i>) is often used in putting a question, and sometimes in making an
affirmation; and therefore some translate it <i>truly</i>. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#176;ph</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>haphach</i>) is considered by some to mean "turning upside down,"
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F532</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as if he had said, "Shall your turning upside down be reckoned live clay?"
Others render it "turning," that is, the purposes which are formed in the heart.
But the most generally received rendering is, "turning upside down" or
"destruction." As if he had said, "I would care no more about destroying you,
than the potter would care about turning the clay; for you are like clay,
because I have created you with my hand."</font><br><font face="Palatino">But as
the Prophet appears to contrast those two particles
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;a</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>im</i>) and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>ki</i>), I am more inclined to a different opinion, though I do not object
to the former exposition, which contains a doctrine in other respects useful. My
view of it therefore is this, "Shall your turning, that is, the purposes which
you ponder in your heart, be like potter's clay? Is it not as if the vessel said
to the potter, Thou hast not formed me? Your pride is astonishing; for you act
as if you had created yourselves, and as if you had everything in your own
power. I had a right to appoint whatever I thought fit. When you dare to assume
such power and authority, you are too little acquainted with your condition, and
you do not know that you are men."
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F533</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">This
diversity of expositions makes no difference as to the Prophet's meaning, who
had no other object in view than to confirm the doctrine taught in the preceding
verse; for he still exclaims against proud men, who claim so much power to
themselves that they cannot endure the authority of God, and entertain a false
opinion about themselves, which leads them to despise all exhortations, as if
they had been gods. Thus do they deny that God has created them; for whatever
men claim for themselves, they take from God, and deprive him of the honor which
is due to him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Only in the first clause would
the meaning at all differ; for those who interpret
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;a</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>im</i>) affirmatively, consider this verse to mean, "<i>Truly</i>, I will
destroy you as a potter would break the pot which he had made." But as the
Prophet had to do with proud men, who sought out lurking-places in order to
deceive God, I rather view it as a question, "Are you so able workmen that the
revolutions of your brain can make this or that, as a potter, by turning the
wheel, frames vessels at his pleasure?" Let every person adopt his own opinion:
I follow that which I consider to be
probable.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is it not yet a little
while?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Lord now declares that he will make
those wicked men to know who they are; as if he had said, "You are now asleep in
your pride, but I shall speedily awake you." Men indulge themselves, till they
feel the powerful hand of God; and therefore the Prophet threatens that the
judgment of God will overtake such profound
indifference.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Lebanon
shall be turned into Carmel.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F534</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Under the names "Lebanon" and "Carmel" he intended to express a renovation of
the world and a change of affairs. But as to the object of the allusion,
commentators differ widely from each other. As Mount "Lebanon" was clothed with
trees and forests, and "Carmel" had fruitful and fertile fields. Many think that
the Jews are compared to "Carmel," because they will be barren, and Christians
to "Lebanon," because they will yield a great abundance of fruits. That opinion
is certainly plausible, as men are usually gratified by everything that is
ingenious; but a parallel passage, which we shall afterwards see,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233215&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
32:15), will shew that the Prophet here employs the comparison for the purpose
of magnifying the grace of God; for, when he shall again begin to bless his
people, the vast abundance of all blessings will take away from "Carmel" the
celebrity which it possessed. He therefore threatens that he will turn "Lebanon"
into "Carmel," that is, a forest will become a cultivated field, and will
produce corn, and the cultivated fields shall yield so great an abundance of
fruits that, if their present and future conditions be compared, they may now be
pronounced to be unfruitful and barren. This mode of expression will be more
fully explained when we come to consider
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233215&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
32:15.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Others view "Carmel" as an appellative,
but I prefer to regard it as a proper name; for it means that those fruitful
fields may now be reckoned uncultivated and barren, in comparison of the new and
unwonted fertility. Others explain it allegorically, and take "Lebanon" as
denoting proud men, and "Carmel" as denoting mean and ordinary persons. This may
be thought to be acute and ingenious, but I choose rather to follow that more
simple interpretation which I have already stated. That the godly may not be
discouraged, he passes from threatenings to proclaim grace, and declares that
when, by enduring for a little the cross laid on them, they shall have given
evidence of the obedience of their faith, a sudden renovation is at hand to fill
them with joy. And yet, by shutting out the ungodly from this hope, he intimates
that, when they are at ease, and promise to themselves peace or a truce,
destruction is very near at hand; for, "when they shall say, Peace and Safety,"
as Paul tells us, "then sudden destruction will overtake them."

Thessalonians 5:3.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And in that day shall the
deaf hear.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He promises that the Church of God,
as we have said, shall still be preserved amidst those calamities. Though the
world be shaken by innumerable tempests, and tossed up and down, and though
heaven and earth shall mingle, yet the Lord will preserve the multitude of the
godly, and will raise up his Church, as it were, out of the midst of death. This
ought to strengthen in no ordinary manner the faith of the godly; for it is an
extraordinary miracle of God that, amidst the numerous and extensive ruins of
empires and monarchies, which happen here and there, the seed of the godly is
preserved, among whom the same religion, the same worship of God, the same
faith, and the same method of salvation, are
continued.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the eyes of the
blind shall see.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> But Isaiah appears here to
contradict himself; for formerly he foretold that among the people of God there
would be so great stupidity that nobody would understand, and now he says that
even "the deaf" shall understand, and "the blind shall see." He therefore means
that the Church must first be chastised and purified, and that not in a common
and ordinary way, but in a way so unusual that it will appear to have altogether
perished. He therefore says, <i>in that day</i>, that is, after having punished
the wicked and purified his Church, not only will he enrich the earth with an
abundance of fruits, but, by renewing the face of it, he will at the same time
restore "hearing to the deaf" and "sight to the blind," that they may receive
his doctrine. Men have no ears and no eyes, so long as this dreadful punishment
lasts; the minds of all are stupefied and confounded, and do not understand
anything. When the plagues and distresses shall have come to an end, the Lord
will open his eyes, that they may behold and embrace his goodness and
compassion.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This is the true method of restoring
the Church, when it gives sight to the blind and hearing to the deaf, which we
see that Christ also did, not only to the bodies but also to the souls.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430907&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
9:7,39.) We too have experienced this in our own time, when we have been brought
out of the darkness of ignorance, in which we were enveloped, and have been
restored to the true light; and eyes have been restored to see, and ears to hear
it, which formerly were shut and closed; for the Lord "pierced them,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;194006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
40:6,) that he might bring us to obey him. The blessing which he promised in the
renovation of the earth was indeed a kind of proof of reconciliation; but far
more excellent is that illumination of which he now speaks, without which all
God's benefits not only are lost, but are turned to our destruction. Justly does
God claim for himself a work so glorious and excellent; because there is nothing
for which there is less ground of hope than that the blind should recover sight,
and that the deaf should recover hearing, by their own strength. This is
evidently promised, in a peculiar manner, to the elect alone; for the greater
part of men always continue in their
darkness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.

take joy in Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Such is my translation of
this passage, while others render it, "They shall add," or "continue to
rejoice;" for the Prophet describes not a "joy" which is continued but rather a
"joy" which is new. As if he had said, "Though they are now distressed and
sorrowful, yet I will give them occasion of gladness, so that they shall again
be filled with "joy." He speaks of the "humble;" and hence it ought to be
observed that our afflictions prepare us for receiving the grace of God; for the
Lord casts us down and afflicts us, that he may afterwards raise us up. Thus,
when the Lord corrects his people, we ought not to lose heart, but should recall
to remembrance those statements, that we may always hope for better things, and
may believe that, after such calamities and distresses, he will at length bring
joy to his Church. Yet we again learn from it what I briefly mentioned a little
before, that the grace of illumination does not belong indiscriminately to all;
for, although all have been chastened together, yet not all have had their
hearts subdued by affliction, so as truly to become "poor in spirit," or "meek."

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the violent man is brought to
nought.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He states more clearly what we have
already mentioned in the former verse, namely, that the restoration of the
Church consists in this, that the Lord raises up those who are cast down, and
has compassion on the poor. But that purification of the Church, of which we
have already spoken, is first necessary; for so long as the Lord does not
execute his judgment against the wicked, and the bad are mixed with the good, so
as even to hold the highest place in the Church, everything is soiled and
corrupted, God is not worshipped or feared, and even godliness is trampled under
feet. When therefore the ungodly are removed or subdued, the Church is restored
to its splendor, and the godly, freed from distresses and calamities, leap for
joy.</font><br><font face="Palatino">First, he calls them
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yxyr[</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>gnaritzim</i>,) "violent." There are various interpretations of this word;
but I think that the Prophet distinguishes between those who are openly wicked,
and have no shame,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F535</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and those who have some appearance of goodness, and yet are not better than
others, for they mock at God in their hearts. But perhaps by the two adjectives,
"violent" and "scorners," he describes the same persons; because, like robbers
among men, they seize, oppress, treat with cruelty, and commit every kind of
outrage, and yet are not withheld by any fear of God, because they regard
religion as a fable.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they
who hastened early to iniquity.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F536</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Under this class he includes other crimes. He speaks not of the Chaldeans or
Assyrians, but of those who wished to be reckoned in the number of the godly,
and boasted of being the seed of Abraham.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That make a man an offender

the persons with whom the Prophet had to do, namely, with hypocrites and profane
scorners, who set at nought all the reproofs and threatenings of the Prophets,
and who wished to frame a God according to their own fancy. Such persons,
desiring to have unbounded license, that they might indulge freely in their
pleasures and their crimes, bore very impatiently the keen reproofs of the
prophets, and did not calmly submit to be restrained. On this account they
carefully observed and watched for their words, that they might take them by
surprise, or give a false construction. I have no doubt that he reproves wicked
men, who complained of the liberty used by the prophets, and of the keenness of
their reproofs, as if they had intended to attack the people, and the nobles,
and the priests; for hence arise the calumnies and false accusations which are
brought even against the faithful servants of God. Hence arise those doubtful
and ensnaring questions which are spread out as snares and nets, that they may
either bring a righteous man into danger of his life, or may practice some kind
of deceit upon him. We see that the Pharisees and Sadducees did so to Christ
himself.

for him that reproveth in the gate.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This latter
clause, which is added for the sake of exposition, does not allow us to
interpret the verse as referring generally to calumnies, and other arts by which
cunning men entrap the unwary; for now the Prophet condemns more openly those
wicked contrivances by which ungodly men endeavor to escape all censure and
reproof. As it was "in the gates" that public assemblies and courts of justice
were held, and great crowds assembled there, the prophets publicly reproved all,
and did not spare even the judges; for at that time the government was in the
hands of men whom it was necessary to admonish and reprove sharply. Instead of
repenting, as they ought to have done when they were warned, they became worse,
and were enraged against the prophets, and laid snares for them; for "they
hated," as Amos says, "him that reproveth in the gate, and abhorred him that
speaketh uprightly."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;300510&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Amos
5:10.) This relates to all, but principally to judges, and those who hold the
reins of government, who take it worse, and are more highly displeased that they
should receive such reproofs; for they wish to be distinguished from the rank of
other men, and to be reckoned the most excellent of all, even though they be the
most wicked.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who have laid
snares.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Commentators differ as to the meaning

(<i>yekoshun</i>;) for some render it "have reproved," and others "have

slanders, in order to drive reprovers far away from then. But I trust that my
readers will approve of the meaning which I have
followed.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And have turned

By wicked and deceitful contrivances, they endeavor to cause the righteous to be
hated and abhorred by all men, and to be reckoned the most wicked of all; but,
after having thus sported with the world, they will at length perish. Such is
the consolation which the Lord gives, that he will not suffer the wickedness of
the ungodly to pass unpunished, though they give way to mirth and wantonness for
a time, but will at length restrain them. Yet "we have need of patience, that we
may wait for the fulfillment of these promises."

Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is the conclusion of the former
statement; for he comforts the people, that they may not despair in that
wretched and miserable condition to which they shall be reduced. We ought to
observe the time to which those things must relate, that is, when the people
have been brought into a state of slavery, the temple overturned, the sacrifices
taken away, and when it might be thought that all religion had fallen down, and
that there was no hope of deliverance. The minds of believers must therefore
have been supported by this prediction, that, when they were shipwrecked, they
might still have this plank left, which they might seize firmly, and by which
they might be brought into the harbour. We too ought to take hold of these
promises, even in the most desperate circumstances, and to rely on them with our
whole heart.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the house of
Jacob.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The address made to them should lead us
to remark, that the power of the word of God is perpetual, and is so efficacious
that it exerts its power, so long as there is a people that fears and worships
him. There are always some whom the Lord reserves for himself, and he does not
allow the seed of the godly to perish. Since the Lord hath spoken, if we believe
his word, we shall undoubtedly derive benefit from it. His truth is firm, and
therefore, if we rely on him, we shall never want
consolation.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who redeemed
Abraham.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Not without good reason does he add,
that he who now declares that he will be kind to the children of Jacob is the
same God "who redeemed Abraham." He recalls the attention of the people to the
very beginning of the Church, that they may behold the power of God, which had
formerly been made known by proofs so numerous and so striking that it ought no
longer to be doubted. If they gloried in the name of Abraham, they ought to
consider whence it was that the Lord first delivered him, that is, from the
service of idols, which both he and his fathers had worshipped.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011131&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
11:31; 12:1;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;062402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joshua

Egypt on account of his wife,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
12:17,) and again in Gerar,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012014&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
20:14,) and again when he subdued kings,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011416&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
14:16,) and likewise when he received offspring after being past having
children.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
21:2, 5.) Although the Prophet has chiefly in view the adoption of God, when the
Lord commanded him to leave "his father's house,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
12:1,) yet under the word "redeemed" he includes likewise all blessings; for we
see that Abraham was "redeemed" on more than one occasion, that is, he was
rescued from very great dangers and from the risk of his
life.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, if the Lord raised up from Abraham
alone, and at a time when he had no children, a Church which he should
afterwards preserve, will he not protect it for ever, even when men shall think
that it has perished? What happened? When Christ came, how wretched was the
dispersion, and how numerous and powerful were the enemies that opposed him!
Yet, in spite of them all, his kingdom was raised up and established, the Church
flourished, and drew universal admiration. No one therefore ought to doubt that
the Lord exerts his power whenever it is necessary, and defends his Church
against enemies, and restores
her.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jacob shall not now be
ashamed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He means that it often happens that
good men are constrained by shame to hang down their heads, as Jeremiah declares
in these words, "I will lay my mouth in the dust."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;250329&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Lamentations
3:29.) Micah also says, "It is time that wise men should hide their mouth in the
dust."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;330716&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Micah
7:16.)
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F538</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For when the Lord chastises his people so severely, good men must be "ashamed."
Now, the Prophet declares that this state of things will not always last. We
ought not to despair therefore in adversity. Though wicked men jeer and cast
upon us every kind of reproaches, yet the Lord will at length free us from shame
and disgrace. At the same time, however, the Prophet gives warning that this
favor does not belong to proud or obstinate persons who refuse to bend their
neck to God's chastisements, but only to the humble, whom shame constrains to
hang down their heads, and to walk sorrowful and
downcast.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It may be asked, Why does he say,
"Jacob shall not be ashamed?" For "Jacob" had been long dead, and it might be
thought that he ascribed feeling to the dead, and supposed them to be capable of
knowing our affairs.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F539</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Hence also the Papists think that the dead are spectators of our actions. But
the present instance is a personification, such as we frequently find in
Scripture. In the same manner also Jeremiah says, "In Ramah was heard the voice
of Rachel bewailing her children, and refusing to be comforted, because they are
not;" for he describes the defeat of the tribe of Benjamin by the wailing of
"Rachel," who was their remote ancestor.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;243115&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
31:15.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Isaiah introduces Jacob as moved with
shame on account of the enormous crimes of his posterity; for Solomon tells us
that "a wise son is the glory of his father and a foolish son brings grief and
sorrow to his mother."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;201001&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
10:1.) Though mothers bear much, still they blush on account of the wicked
actions of their children. What then shall be the case with fathers, whose
affection for their children is less accompanied by foolish indulgence, and aims
chiefly at training them to good and upright conduct? Do they not on that
account feel keener anguish, when their children act wickedly and disgracefully?
But here the Prophet intended to pierce the hearts of the people and wound them
to the quick, by holding out to them their own patriarch, on whom God bestowed
blessings so numerous and so great, but who is now dishonored by his posterity;
so that if he had been present, he would have been compelled to blush deeply on
their account. He therefore accuses the people of ingratitude, in bringing
disgrace on their fathers whom they ought to have
honored.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>

(<i>ki</i>) is here used in its natural and original meaning of <i>for</i> or
<i>because</i>. The Prophet assigns the reason why the disgrace of Israel shall
be taken away. It is, because he will have children, and those who were thought
to have perished will be still
alive.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The work of my hands in
the midst of him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By giving them this name, he
intended, I have no doubt, to describe the astonishing work of redemption; for
those whom God adopts to be his children, and receives into fellowship with
himself, are made by him, as it were, new men, agreeably to that
saying,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">In that passage the Psalmist describes in a similar
manner the renewal of the Church; for this description, as we have repeatedly
stated on former occasions, does not relate to the general creation which
extends to all, but leads us to acknowledge his power, that we may not judge of
the salvation of the Church by the present appearances of things. And here we
ought to observe various contrasts; first, between the ruinous condition of the
Church and her surpassing beauty, between her shame and her glory; secondly,
between the people of God and other nations; thirdly, between "the works of
God's hands" and the works of men, (for by God's hand alone can the Church be
restored;) and fourthly, between her flourishing condition and the ruinous and
desolate state to which she had formerly been reduced. By the phrase, "in the
midst of him," is meant a perfect restoration, by which the people shall be
united and joined together in such a manner as to occupy not only the
extremities, but the very heart and the chief places of the
country.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall hallow my
name.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Last of all, he points out the end of
redemption. We were all created, that the goodness of God might be celebrated
among us. But as the greater part of mankind have revolted from their original
condition, God hath chosen a Church in which his praises should resound and
dwell, as the Psalmist says, "Praise waiteth for thee in Zion."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;196501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
65:1.) Now, since many even of the flock have degenerated, the Prophet assigns
this office to believers, whom God had miraculously
preserved.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall fear the
God of Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Because hypocrites, as we have
formerly seen, honor God with their lips, but are far removed from him in their
heart, after speaking of the ascription of praise, he next mentions <i>fear</i>;
thus meaning that our praises are reckoned of no value, unless we honestly and
sincerely obey God, and unless our whole life testify that we do not
hypocritically utter the name of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then shall the erring in spirit
learn wisdom.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He again repeats that promise
which he formerly noticed briefly; for so long as the understandings of men
shall be struck with ignorance and blindness, even though they enjoy abundance
of every kind of blessings, yet they are always surrounded and besieged by ruin.
In making preparation for the restoration of the Church, the Lord therefore
enlightens by his word, and illuminates by the light of understanding, his own
people, who formerly wandered astray in darkness. He does this by the secret
influence of the Spirit; for it would be of little value to be taught by the
external word, if he did not also instruct our hearts
inwardly.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the murmurers

(<i>rogenim</i>) "whisperers," and others, "wanderers." But it means that those
who formerly murmured against the prophets, and could not endure their warnings,
would be obedient and submissive; and therefore I have chosen to render it
<i>murmurers</i>. Hence we see how wonderful is the mercy of God, who brings
back into the path those who were highly unworthy, and makes them partakers of
so great blessings. Let us carefully ponder this subject in private. Is there
any one of us that has not sometimes "murmured" against God, and despised pure
doctrine? Nay, more, if God had not softened the obstinate, and brought them
mildly to obey, nearly the whole human race would have perished in their
madness.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Woe to the rebellious
children.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet exclaims against the
Jews, because, when they were unable to bear the burden, when they were hard
pressed by the Assyrians and other enemies, they fled to Egypt for help. This
reproof might appear to be excessively severe, were we merely to consider that
weak and miserable men, especially when they are unjustly oppressed, have a
right to ask assistance even from wicked persons; for it is a principle
implanted in us by nature, that all human beings should willingly, and of their
own accord, endeavor to assist each other. But when we come to the very sources,
we shall find that no ordinary or inconsiderable guilt had been contracted by
the people.</font><br><font face="Palatino">First, it is no light offense, but
wicked obstinacy, to disregard and even despise God's government, and follow
their own inclinations. But Goal had strictly forbidden them to enter into any
alliance or league with the Egyptians.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021317&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
13:17;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051716&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
17:16.) There were chiefly two causes of this prohibition. One was general, and
related to alliances and leagues with other nations; for God did not wish that
his people should be corrupted by the superstitions of the Gentiles.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;022332&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
23:32; 34:15;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
7:2.) We are gradually infected, I know not how, by the vices of those with whom
we have intercourse and familiarity; and as we are more prone by nature to copy
vices than virtues, we easily become accustomed to corruptions, and, in short,
the infection rapidly spreads from one person to another. This has happened to
our own country, France, in consequence of having intercourse with many nations,
which leads her too eagerly to imitate their vices, and has covered her with
frightful pollution. This immoderate desire of forming alliances unlocked Asia
to the Mahometans, and next laid Europe open to them; and though they still
retain their moderation in eating and drinking, all that has been subdued by
their arms has contracted nothing but filth and debasement. This is what we
Frenchmen have also derived from our intercourse with other
nations.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The second reason was special and
peculiar to this nation; for, since the Lord had delivered the Jews out of
Egypt, and commanded them to remember so remarkable a benefit, he forbade them
to have any intercourse with the Egyptians. And if they had entered into an
alliance with the Egyptians, the remembrance of that benefit might easily have
been obliterated; for they would not have been at liberty to celebrate it in
such a manner as had been commanded.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
13:3, 8,14.) It was excessively base to disregard the glory of God for the
purpose of cultivating friendship with an irreligious and wicked nation. Since
God intended also to testify to his people that he alone was more than
sufficient to secure their safety, they ought to have valued that promise so
highly as to exclude themselves willingly from other assistance. It was a very
heinous crime to endeavor to gain the favor of heathen nations on all sides, and
to deprive God of the honor due to him; for if they had been satisfied with
having God's protection alone, they would not have been in such haste to run
down to Egypt. Their noisy eagerness convicted them of
infidelity.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet I have no doubt that the Prophet
directed his indignation against that sacrilege, because, by laboring earnestly
to obtain the assistance of the nations around them, they withheld from God the
praise of almighty power. Hence also the Spirit elsewhere compares that ardor to
the extravagances of love, and even to licentious courses.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240508&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
5:8.) Ezekiel shews that, by joining the Egyptians, they acted as if a woman,
shamefully transgressing the bounds of decency, not only ran furiously after
adulterers, but even desired to associate with horses and asses.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;261626&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
16:26.) And yet here he does not absolutely condemn all leagues that are made
with idolaters, but has especially in view that prohibition by which the law
forbade them to enter into alliance with the Egyptians. It is chiefly on account
of the prohibition that he kindles into such rage; for it was not without
pouring grievous contempt on God that they ran trembling into Egypt. For this
reason he calls them
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yrrws</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>sorerim</i>,) <i>obstinate</i> and <i>rebellious</i>. We have explained this
word at the first chapter.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F540</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It denotes men of hardened wickedness, who knowingly and willingly revolt from
God, or whose obstinacy renders them objects of disgust, so that no integrity or
sincerity is left in them. At first he reproves that vice on this ground, that
they neglected the word of God, and were devoted to their own
counsels.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they may cover
the secret.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The words
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hksm
&#176;snl</font><font face="Palatino">, (<i>linsoch massechah</i>,) are
explained by some commentators to mean, "to pour out the pouring out." Though
this is not at variance with the Prophet's meaning, yet it is more correctly, in
my opinion, translated by others, "that they may cover a covering." I have
followed that version, because the words relate to counsels held secretly and by
stealth, by which they cunningly endeavored to deceive the prophets, and, as it
were, to escape from the eyes of God. Another rendering, "that they may hide
themselves by a covering," is absurd; for although it was for the sake of
protection that they sought the Egyptians, yet he rather alludes to that
craftiness of which I have spoken. Both expositions amount to the same thing.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F541</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">By
three modes of expression he makes nearly the same statement; that they "cover
their counsels," that is, keep them apart from God; that they do not ask at "the
mouth of the Lord;" and that they do not suffer themselves to be governed by
"his Spirit." They who are guided by their own views turn aside to cunning
contrivances, that they may conceal their unbelief and rebellion; and because
they have resolved not to obey the word of God, neither do they ask his Spirit.
Hence arises that miserable and shameful result. Wretchedly and ruinously must
those deliberations and purposes end, over which the Lord does not preside.
There is no wisdom that is not obtained from "his mouth;" and if we "ask at his
mouth," that is, if we consult his word, we shall also be guided by his Spirit,
from whom all prudence and wisdom proceeds.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Let
it be observed that two things are here connected, the word and the Spirit of
God, in opposition to fanatics, who aim at oracles and hidden revelations
without the word; for they wish to come to God, while they neglect and forsake
the word, and thus they do nothing else than attempt, as the saying is, to fly
without wings. First of all, let it be held as a settled principle, that
whatever we undertake or attempt, without the word of God, must be improper and
wicked, because we ought to depend wholly on his mouth. And indeed, if we
remember what feebleness of understanding, or rather, what lack of
understanding, is found in all mankind, we shall acknowledge that they are
excessively foolish who claim for themselves so much wisdom, that they do not
even deign to ask at the mouth of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">If it be
objected, that the Scriptures do not contain everything, and that they do not
give special answers on those points of which we are in doubt, I reply, that
everything that relates to the guidance of our life is contained in them
abundantly. If, therefore, we have resolved to allow ourselves to be directed by
the word of God, and always seek in it the rule of life, God will never suffer
us to remain in doubt, but in all transactions and difficulties will point out
to us the conclusion. Sometimes, perhaps, we shall have to wait long, but at
length the Lord will rescue and deliver us, if we are ready to obey him.
Although, therefore, we are careful and diligent in the use of means, as they
are called, yet we ought always to attend to this consideration, not to
undertake anything but what we know to be pleasing and acceptable to
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet condemns the presumption of
those who attempt unlawful methods, and think that they will succeed in them,
when they labor, right or wrong, to secure their safety, as if it could be done
contrary to the will of God. It is certain that this proceeds from unbelief and
distrust, because they do not think that God alone is able to protect them,
unless they call in foreign though forbidden assistance. Hence come unlawful
leagues, hence come tricks and cheating, by which men fully believe that their
affairs will be letter conducted than if they acted towards each other with
candour and fairness. There are innumerable instances of this unbelief in every
department of human life; for men think that they will be undone, if they are
satisfied with the blessing of God, and transact all their affairs with truth
and uprightness. But we ought to consider that we are forsaken, rejected, and
cursed by God, whenever we have recourse to forbidden methods and unlawful ways.
In all our undertakings, deliberations, and attempts, therefore, we ought to be
regulated by the will of God. We ought always to consider what he forbids or
commands, so as to be fully disposed to obey his laws, and to submit ourselves
to be guided by his Spirit, otherwise our rashness will succeed very
ill.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they may add sin to
sin.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet says this, because the Jews,
by those useless defences which they supposed to fortify them strongly, did
nothing else than stumble again on the same stone, and double their criminality,
which already was very great. Our guilt is increased, and becomes far heavier,
when we endeavor, by unlawful methods, to escape the wrath of God. But we ought
especially to consider this expression as applicable to the Jews, because, after
having brought the Assyrians into Judea, (for they had called them to their
assistance against Israel and Syria,) they wished to drive them out by the help
of the Egyptians.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121607&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 16:7, 17:4, 18:21.) The Jews were hard pressed by the Assyrians, and were
justly punished for their unbelief, because they resorted to men, and not to
God, for aid; and we see that this happened to many nations who called the Turk
to their assistance. So far were the Jews from repenting of their conduct, and
acknowledging that they had been justly punished, that they even added evil to
evil, as if crime could be washed out by crime. On this account they are more
severely threatened; for they who persevere in their wickedness, and rush with
furious eagerness against God, and do not allow themselves to be brought back to
the right path by any warnings or chastisements, deserve to be more sharply and
heavily punished.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They walk that they may go down
into Egypt.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The reason why the Prophet condemns
this "going down" has been already explained;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F542</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but as their guilt was aggravated by open and heinous obstinacy, he again
repeats that they did this without asking at the mouth of God, and even in the
face of his
prohibition.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Strengthening
themselves with the strength of Pharaoh.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He
again draws their attention to the source of the evil, when he says that it was
done for the purpose of acquiring strength, because they placed confidence in
the forces of the Egyptians. Hence arose that lawless desire of entering into a
league. In this way they shewed that they cared little about the power of God,
and did not greatly trust in him; and they openly displayed their
unbelief.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It might be objected, that men are the
servants of God, and that it is lawful for any one to make use of their
services, whenever they are needed. I reply, that while we make use of the
labors and services of men, it ought to be in such a manner as to depend on God
alone. But there was another reason peculiar to the Jews, for they knew that God
had forbidden them to call the Egyptians to their assistance, and, by doing so,
they withheld from God all that they ascribed to Pharaoh and to his forces. Thus
it is not without good reason that Isaiah contrasts Pharaoh with God; for the
creatures are opposed to God, and enter, as it were, into contest with him when
they rise up against God, or whenever men abuse them, or place their hearts and
confidence in them, or desire them more than is
lawful.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But to you shall the strength of
Pharaoh be shame.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now shews what shall be
the end of the wicked, who despise God and his word, and follow those schemes
which are most agreeable to their own views. All that they undertake shall tend
to their ruin. He threatens not only that they shall be disappointed of their
hope, but also that they are seeking with great toil, destruction and ruin, from
which they will gain nothing but sorrow and disgrace. To all wicked men it must
unavoidably happen that, although for a time they appear to gain their object,
and though everything succeeds to their wish, yet in the end all shall be
ruinous to them. It is the just reward of their rashness, when they go beyond
the limits of the word; for nothing that has been acquired by wicked and
unlawful methods can be of advantage to any
person.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By way of admission he calls it "the
strength of Pharaoh," as if he had said, "You think that you gain much
protection from Pharaoh, but it will yield you reproach and disgrace. <i>The
shadow of Egypt</i>, by which you hoped to be covered, will make you blush for
shame." Accordingly, both expressions, "shame" and "disgrace," have the same
meaning; and as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hprj</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>cherpah</i>,)
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F543</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
<i>reproach</i>, is a stronger expression than "shame," it is afterwards added
for the purpose of bringing out the meaning more
fully.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For his princes were in
Zoan.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet not only says that the aid of
the Egyptians was sought, and that they were invited to assist, but expresses
something more, namely, that the Jews obtained it with great labor and expense.
They had to perform long and painful journeys, to endure much toil, and to
expend vast sums of money, in order to arrive, loaded with presents, at the most
distant cities of Egypt, which are here named by the Prophet. On this embassy
were sent, not persons of mean or ordinary rank, but "princes" and nobles; and
therefore the censure was more severe, because they slavishly solicited an
alliance with Egypt, and wandered like suppliants through various countries. It
is proper also to bear in mind the contrast which we have already pointed out.
They did not need to go far to seek God; they did not need to endure much toil,
or spend large sums of money, in calling on him. He invited them by his promise,
"This is my rest," and assured them that in that place they would not call upon
him in vain.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
132:14;

themselves, and to run to the very ends of the world, than to receive the
assistance which was offered to them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall all be
ashamed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He confirms the former statement; for
it was very difficult to convince ungodly men that all that they undertook
without the word of God would be ruinous to them. In order to punish them more
severely, God sometimes bestows on them prosperity, that they may be more and
more deceived, and may throw themselves down headlong; for by the righteous
judgment of God it is brought about, that Satan draws them by these allurements,
and drives them into his nets. Yet the final result is, that not only are they
deprived of the assistance which they expected, but they are likewise severely
punished both for their presumption and for their
unbelief.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Of a people that
will not profit them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He threatens not only
that the Egyptians will prove false, as wicked men often forsake at the utmost
need, or even treacherously ruin, those whom they have fed with empty promises,
but that even though they endeavor to the utmost to fulfill the promises which
they have made, still they will be of no use. Whatever may be the earnestness
with which men endeavor to help us, yet, as events are in the hand of God, they
will "profit nothing" without his blessing. It was difficult to believe when the
Prophet spoke, that a nation so powerful could yield no assistance; but we ought
always to hold it as a principle fully settled, that all the advantage that
dazzles us in the world will vanish away, except in so far as God is gracious
and kind, and makes it sure for our
advantage.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The burden of the beasts of the
south.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> After having spoken loudly against the
consultations of the Jews about asking assistance from the Egyptians, he
ridicules the enormous cost and the prodigious inconveniences which they endured
on that account; for at so high a price did they purchase their destruction; and
he threatens the same curse as formerly, because unhappily they acted in
opposition to the word of God. He mentions "the south," because they journeyed
through a southern region, Egypt being situated to "the south" of Judea. He
therefore calls them "beasts of burden" on account of the journey, and addresses
them in order to pour contempt on men, because it was in vain to speak to them,
and they were deaf to all exhortations. Accordingly, he threatens that the
effect of this prediction shall reach the very "beasts of burden," though men do
not understand it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the land
of trouble and distress.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The people having
proudly disregarded the threatenings, the Prophet seasonably turns to the horses
and camels; and declares that, although they are void of reason, yet they shall
perceive that God hath not spoken in vain, and that, though the people imagined
that there was uninterrupted prosperity in Egypt, it would be a land of anguish
and affliction even to the brute animals. The journey was labourious and
difficult, and yet they shrunk from no exertion in order to satisfy their mad
desire; and to such a pitch of madness was their ardor carried, that they were
not discouraged by the tediousness of the
journey.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The young lion and
the strong lion.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In addition to the
inconveniences already mentioned, Isaiah threatens the special vengeance of God,
that they shall encounter "lions" and beasts of prey. There was nothing new or
uncommon in this to persons who traveled from Judea into Egypt; but here he
threatens something extraordinary and more dangerous. In addition to the
inconveniences and toils, and to the sums of money which they shall expend, God
will also send disastrous occurrences, and at length they shall be miserably
ruined.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This doctrine ought to be applied to us,
who are chargeable with a fault exceedingly similar; for in dangers we fly to
unlawful remedies, and think that they will profit us, though God disapproves of
them. We must therefore experience the same result and fall into the same
dangers, if we do not restrain our unbelief and wickedness by the word of God.
We ought also to observe and guard against that madness which hurries us along
to spare no expense and to shrink from no toil, while we obey with excessive
ardor our foolish desire and wish. We had abundant experience of this in Popery,
when we were held captives by it, running about in all directions, and wearying
ourselves with long and toilsome pilgrimages to various saints; yet the greatest
possible annoyances were reckoned by us to be light and trivial. But now, when
we are commanded to obey God and to endure "the light yoke" of Christ,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401130&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
11:30,) we find that we cannot endure
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>

vanity.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F544</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This verse contains the explanation of the former statement; for he repeats and
threatens the same thing, that the Egyptians, after having worn out the Jews by
various annoyances and by prodigious expense, will be of no service to them.
"The strength of Egypt" will do them no good, even though he be earnest in
assisting them, and employ all his forces. Thus shall the Jews be disappointed
of their hope, and deceive themselves to their great vexation. The particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>u</i>) signifies here either <i>for</i> or <i>surely</i>, as I have
translated it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore have
I cried to her.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now shews that the Jews have
no excuse for fleeing with such haste into Egypt, and that they are willingly
foolish and unworthy of any pardon, because they do not repent when they are
warned. When he says that he "cried" to Jerusalem, I consider this to refer to
God himself, who complains that his distinct warnings and instructions produced
no effect, and that his exhortation to them <i>to sit still</i> was not without
foundation, but was intended to meet the troubles and calamities which he
foresaw. Whence came that restlessness, but because they refused to believe the
words of the Lord? In a word, he shews that it is mere obstinacy that drives
them to flee into Egypt; for by "sitting still" they might provide for their
safety.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By the word "cry" he means that he not
only warned them by words, but likewise chastised them; and this makes it
evident that their obstinacy and rebellion were greater. "To sit still" means
here "to remain and to stay at home," though he will afterwards shew (verse 15)
that they ought to have peaceable dispositions. The cause of their alarm and
impassioned exertions was, that they were terrified and struck with dismay, and
did not think that God's protection was sufficient, if they had not also the
Egyptians on their side. Thus, they who do not give sufficient honor to God have
their hearts agitated by unbelief, so that they tremble and never find
peace.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now go, and write this vision on
a tablet.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> After having convicted the Jews of
manifest unbelief, he means that it should be attested and sealed by permanent
records, that posterity may know how obstinate and rebellious that nation was,
and how justly the Lord punished them. We have said that it was customary with
the prophets to draw up an abridgment of their discourses and attach it to the
gates of the temple, and that, after having allowed full time to all to see and
read it, the ministers took it down, and preserved it among the records of the
temple; and thus the book of the prophets was collected and compiled.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F545</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But when any prediction was remarkable and peculiarly worthy of being
remembered, then the Lord commanded that it should be written in larger
characters, that the people might be induced to read it, and to examine it more
attentively.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230801&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
8:1;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;350202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
2:2.) The Lord now commands that this should be done, in order to intimate that
this was no ordinary affair, that the whole ought to be carefully written, and
deserved the closest attention, and that it ought not only to be read, but to be
engraven on the remembrance of men in such a manner that no lapse of time can
efface it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet there can be no doubt that
Isaiah, by this prediction, drew upon himself the intense hatred of all ranks,
because he intended to expose and hold them up for abhorrence, not only among
the men of his own age, but also among posterity. There is nothing which men
resent more strongly than to have their crimes made publicly known and fastened
on the remembrance of men; they reckon it ignominious and disgraceful, and abhor
it above all things. But the Prophet must obey God, though he should become the
object of men's hatred, and though his life should be in imminent danger. Here
we ought to observe his steadfastness in dreading nothing, that he might obey
God and fulfill his calling. He despised hatred, dislike, commotions,
threatenings, false alarms, and immediate dangers, that he might boldly and
fearlessly discharge the duties of his office. Copying his example, we ought to
do this, if we wish to hear and follow God who calls
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Before

(<i>ittam</i>) is translated by some, "with them," but it is better to translate
it "before them," or, "in their sight;" for it was proper that he should openly
irritate the Jews, to whom he presented this prediction written "on a tablet."
Hence we ought to infer, that wicked men, though they cannot bear reproof and
are filled with rage, ought nevertheless to be reproved sharply and openly; and
that threatenings and reproofs, though they be of no advantage to them, will yet
serve for an example to others, when those men shall be stamped with perpetual
infamy. In them will be fulfilled what is written elsewhere,</font><br></div>

willingly or are ashamed of their crimes, God commands that a record of their
shame shall be prepared, that it may be placed continually before the eyes of
men. As victories and illustrious actions were commonly engraved on tables of
brass, so God commands that the disgrace which the Jews brought upon themselves
by their transgressions, shall be inscribed on public
tablets.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That it may be till
the last day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It was very extraordinary, as I
remarked a little before, that the Prophet was charged by a solemn injunction to
pronounce infamy on his countrymen. For this reason he adds "till the last day,"
either that they may be held up to abhorrence through an uninterrupted
succession of ages, or because, at the appearance of the Judge, the crimes of
the wicked shall be fully laid open when he shall "ascend his judgment seat, and
the books shall be opened;" for those things which formerly were hidden and
wrapped in darkness will then be revealed.

must therefore reject the fancies of fanatics and wicked men, who say that this

times. Away with such blasphemies from the ears of the godly; for, when Isaiah
died, his doctrine must flourish and yield
fruit.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For this is a rebellious
people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The word <i>for</i> or <i>because</i>
points to the explanation of what has been already said; for the Prophet
explains what the Lord intends to declare to posterity, namely, that the
perverseness of this nation is desperate, because they cannot submit to be
restrained by any doctrine. That the honorable appellation of the "people"
wounded to the quick the hearts both of the ordinary ranks and of the nobles,
may be inferred from their loud vaunting; for they boasted that they were the
holy and elect seed of Abraham; as if God's adoption had been a veil to cover
the grossest crimes. But God commands that their crimes shall nevertheless be
brought to light and openly
proclaimed.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who refuse to hear
the law of Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By accusing them of this,
he points out the source of all evils, namely, contempt of the word, which
discovers their wickedness and their contempt of God himself; for it is idle to
pretend that they worship God, when they are disobedient to his word. Isaiah
likewise aggravates their guilt, by saying that they reject the remedy which
doctrine offers for curing their diseases. On this account he calls them not
only "rebellious," and untameable or abandoned, but <i>liars</i> or treacherous
persons; for they who refuse to obey the word of God, openly revolt from him, as
if they could not endure his authority; and at the same time, they shew that
they are given up to vanity and the delusions of Satan, so that they take no
pleasure in sincerity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who say to the seers, See
not.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now describes more clearly, and shews,
as it were, to the life, the contempt of God and obstinacy which he formerly
mentioned; for wicked men not only pour ridicule on doctrine, but furiously
drive it away, and would even wish to have it utterly crushed and buried. This
is what Isaiah intended to express. Not only do they turn away their ears, and
eyes, and all their senses, from doctrine, but they would even wish that it were
destroyed and taken out of the way; for wickedness is invariably attended by
such rage as would lead them to wish the destruction of that which they cannot
endure. The power and efficacy of the word wounds and enrages them to such a
degree, that they give vent to their fierceness and cruelty like wild and savage
beasts. They would gladly escape, but whether they will or not, they are
constrained to hear God speaking, and to tremble at his majesty. This bitterness
is followed by hatred of the prophets, snares, alarms, persecutions, banishment,
tortures, and deaths, by which they think that they can overturn and root out
both the doctrine and the teachers; for men are more desirous to have dreams and
fabulous tales told them than to be faithfully
instructed</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>See not, prophesy
not to us right things.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet does not
relate the words of wicked men, as if they openly made use of these words, but
he describes the state of the fact and their actual dispositions; for he had not
to do with men who were such fools as to make an intentional discovery of their
wickedness. They were singularly cunning hypocrites, who boasted of worshipping
God, and complained that they were unjustly reproached by the prophets. Isaiah
tears off the mask by which they concealed themselves, and discovers what they
are, because they refused to give place to the truth; for whence came the
murmurs against the prophets, but because they could not bear to hear God
speaking?</font><br><font face="Palatino">The prophets were called <i>seers</i>,
because the Lord revealed to them what would afterwards be made known to others.
They were stationed, as it were, in a lofty place, that they might behold from
on high, and as if from "a watch-tower,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;350201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
2:1,) the prosperous or adverse events which were approaching. The people wished
that nothing of an adverse nature should be told them; and therefore they hated
the prophets, because, while they censured and sharply reproved the vices of the
people, they at the same time were witnesses of the approaching judgment of God.
Such is the import of those words, "Do not see, do not prophesy right things."
Not that they spoke in this manner, as we have already said, but because such
was the state of their feelings, and because they desired that the prophets
should speak with mildness, and could not patiently bear the sharpness of their
reproofs. Not one of them was so impudent as to say that he wished to be
deceived, and that he abhorred the truth; for they declared that they sought it
with the greatest eagerness, as all our adversaries boast of doing at the
present day; but they denied that what Isaiah and the other prophets told them
was the word of God. In like manner they plainly told Jeremiah that he was "a
liar,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;244302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah

things,"
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F546</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he points out the very source; for they were ready to receive flatterers with
unbounded applause, and would willingly have allowed their ears to be tickled in
the name of God. And this is the reason why the world is not only liable to be
carried away by delusions, but earnestly desires them; for almost all wish to
have their vices treated with forbearance and encouragement. But it is
impossible that the servants of God, when they endeavor faithfully to discharge
their duty, should be chargeable with being severe reprovers; and hence it
follows that it is an idle and childish evasion, when wicked men pretend that
they would willingly be God's disciples, provided that he were not rigorous. It
is as if they bargained that, for their sake, he should change his nature and
deny himself; as Micah also says, that no prophets were acceptable to the Jews,
but such as "prophesied of wine and strong drink."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;330211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Micah

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Depart from the
way.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The amount of what is stated is, that when
the prophets are set aside, the Lord is also rejected and set aside, and no
regard is paid to him. Wicked men pretend the contrary, for they are ashamed to
acknowledge so great wickedness. But they gain nothing by it; for God wishes
that we should listen to him by means of those to whom he gave injunctions to
declare his will to us, and to administer the doctrine of the word. If therefore
it is our duty to listen to God, if we are bound to pay him any homage, we ought
to shew it by embracing his word, as it is contained in the writings of the
prophets and evangelists. This ought to be carefully observed in commendation of
the word; for they who set it aside act as if they denied that he is
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cause the Holy One of
Israel to depart.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he again points out the
cause of so great wickedness, which doubles their guilt; namely, that God does
not spare or flatter their vices, but acts the part of a good and skillful;
physician. Men desire to be flattered, and cannot patiently endure that God
should threaten them. Hence it comes that men hate and reject the word. Hence
proceeds the furious attack on the prophets, whose reproofs and threatenings
they cannot endure; for there is no reason why men should revolt from the
government of God, but because they take delight in what is wrong and crooked,
and abhor the right way. Appropriately, therefore, does the Prophet join these
two things, dislike of heavenly doctrine and hatred of
uprightness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because you have disdained this
word.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He next declares the punishment of
ungodliness, threatening that they shall not pass unpunished for refusing to
hear God speaking; and he expresses their contempt more strongly by the word
"disdain." He calls it "this word," making use of the demonstrative; for men
would willingly contrive some word adapted to their manner of life, but refuse
to listen to God when he
speaks.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And trusted in
violence and wickedness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> God's gentle
invitation, and his exhortation to quiet rest, are here contrasted with their
disorderly pursuits. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">q&ccedil;[</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>gnoshek</i>) denotes "robbery," and "seizing property which belongs to
another." Others render it "ill-gotten wealth." Those who render it "calumny,"
do not sufficiently express the Prophet's meaning. For my own part, I do not
view it as referring to riches gained by unlawful methods, but rather to that
rebelliousness in which that nation insolently
indulged.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The word "wickedness,"
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F547</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which is added, ought not to be limited to decisions of courts of law; for, in
my opinion, it has a more extensive signification; and by these two words he
intended to express the presumption of wicked men, by which they fiercely and
wantonly rose up against God, because they always dared to follow their own
lawless desires, and to do what was forbidden. And as the poets feign that the
giants made war with God,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F548</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
so those men resisted God's threatenings, and thought that they would speedily
overcome his power by their fierceness and
presumption.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore shall your iniquity be
like a breach falling.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is a threatening of
punishment, and Isaiah expresses it by a very appropriate metaphor. He compares
wicked men to a wall that is rent, or that bulges out. As the "swelling out" of
a wall threatens the ruin of it, because it cannot stand unless all the parts of
it adhere closely to each other, so the haughtiness and insolence of wicked men
are a sign and very sure proof of their approaching ruin; because the more they
are puffed up and swelled without any solid value,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F549</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the more readily do they throw themselves down headlong, and it is impossible
for them not to fall speedily by their own weight. "Rise up," says he, "and act
insolently against God; he will quickly put down your presumption and insolence,
for it is but an empty swelling." Hence we learn that nothing is better for us
than to submit wholly to God, and to keep charge of all our senses, so as to
remain chained and bound by his authority; for they who raise themselves by
shaking off all humility, destroy themselves by collecting much wind. For a
time, indeed, the Lord permits wicked men to swell and utter their big words,
that at length, by their "swelling" and idle boasting, they may bring upon
themselves ruin and destruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the breaking of it shall
be.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When a wall has fallen, some traces of the
ruin are still to be seen, and the stones of it may be applied to use, and to
some extent the wall may even be rebuilt. But here the Prophet threatens that
they who are puffed up with obstinacy against God shall perish in such a manner
that they cannot be restored, and all that is left of them shall be utterly
useless. Accordingly, he employs the metaphor of a potter's vessel, the broken
fragments of which cannot be repaired or put together. These threatenings ought
to make a deep impression upon us, that we may embrace with reverence the word
of God, when we learn that punishments so severe are prepared for those who
despise it; for the Prophet threatens that they shall be utterly destroyed and
ruined, and takes away all hope of their being restored. Nor is the threatening
groundless; for we see how they that despise God, when they have been twice and
three times cast down, still do not cease to raise their crests; for nothing is
more difficult than to root out the false confidence from their hearts.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F550</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thus saith the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he describes one kind of contempt of
God; for when warnings are addressed to hypocrites in general terms, they
commonly produce little effect. In addition to the general doctrine, therefore,
the prophets specify particular instances, which they specially accommodate to
the conduct of those with whom they have to do, so as always to aim at a
definite object. They might have wrangled and urged, "Why do you accuse us of so
great impiety, as if we rejected the word of the Lord?" He therefore brings
forward this class, in order to strike their consciences and cut short their
idle sophistry. Was it not the word of the Lord, In hope and silence shall be
your strength? why did you not rely on God? why did you raise a commotion?" Thus
the Prophet holds them to be convicted, so that they cannot cavil without the
grossest impudence, or, if they do so, will derive no
advantage.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Holy One of
Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He makes use of this appellation, in
order to reproach them the more for their ingratitude, that they may know how
great protection they would have found in God: for God wished to be their
protector and guardian. When they had forsaken him, their distrust carried them
away to solicit the aid of the Egyptians, which was very great and intolerable
wickedness. This title contains a bitter complaint, that they shut out God from
entering, when he drew near to
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In rest and quietness
shall you be safe.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hbw&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>shubah</i>) "repentance." Others render it "rest,"
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F551</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and I am more disposed to adopt that rendering; for I think that the Prophet
intended frequently to impress upon the people, that the Lord demands more from
them than to rely fully upon him. Nor is the repetition of the statement by two
words superfluous; for he expressly intended to bring together the words "rest
and quietness," in order to reprove the people the more sharply for their
distrust and unbelief.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This verse consists of
two clauses, a command and a promise. He enjoins the people to be of a quiet
disposition, and next promises that their salvation shall be certain. The people
do not believe this promise, and consequently they do not obey the command; for
how would they render obedience to God, whom they do not believe, and on whose
promises they do not rely? We need not wonder, therefore, that they do not enjoy
peace and repose; for these cannot exist without faith, and faith cannot exist
without the promises, and as soon as the promises have been embraced, souls that
were restless and uneasy are made calm. Thus, unbelief alone produces that
uneasiness; and therefore the Prophet justly reproves it, and shews that it is
the source of the whole evil.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Though our
condition be not entirely the same with that of the Jews, yet God commands us to
wait for his assistance with quiet dispositions, not to murmur, or be troubled
or perplexed, or to distrust his promises. This doctrine must belong equally to
all believers; for the whole object of Satan's contrivances is to distress them,
and to cast them down from their condition. In like manner had Moses long before
addressed them,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"You shall be silent, and

<div><font face="Palatino">Not that he wished them to sleep or to be idle, but
he enjoined them to have this peace in their hearts. If we have it, we shall
feel that it yields us sufficient protection; and if not, we shall be punished
for our levity and rashness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We will flee on horses;
therefore shall you flee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He shews how they
refused to wait calmly for the salvation of the Lord; for they chose rather to
"flee" to the Egyptians. This is a very beautiful instance of
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajntana&gt;klasiv</font><font face="Palatino">)
throwing back an expression, by which he causes their words, so full of
confidence, to recoil on themselves. In the first of these clauses, "to flee"
means "to escape," and in the second it means "to take flight." The Jews said
that it would be better for them, if they adopted timely measures for guarding
against the danger which was close at hand, and consequently, that they would
best provide for their safety by calling in the aid of the Egyptians. "You shall
certainly flee," says Isaiah, "not to find a place of refuge, but to turn your
back and to be pursued by horses swifter than
yours."</font><br><font face="Palatino">We now perceive more clearly what is the
fault which Isaiah describes. By the distinct reply, <i>No</i>, he shews how
obstinately they refused to comply with the advice which was given to them by
the prophets, and chose rather to provide for their safety in another manner.
Thus, by despising God, they gave a preference to a groundless appearance of
safety, which they had allowed themselves to imagine. We ought, therefore, to
turn away our minds from looking at present appearances and outward assistance,
that they may be wholly fixed on God; for it is only when we are destitute of
outward aid that we rely fully on him. It is lawful for us to use the things of
this world for our assistance, but we altogether abuse them by our wickedness in
forsaking God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is proper also to observe how
unhappy is the end of those who rely more on outward aids than on God; for
everything must be unsuccessful and contrary to their expectation; as we see
that these men, in their attempts to find safety, are constrained to undertake a
flight which is highly disgraceful, and from which they obtain no advantage. At
first there is some appearance of prosperity; but the only effect is, that the
change of condition makes the final result more bitter and distressing. And yet
Isaiah does not affirm that they will receive no assistance from Egypt, but
forewarns them that the Lord will find new methods of thwarting that assistance,
so that they will not be able to escape his hand; for, although all men agree
together, yet they will not succeed in opposition to God and to his
purposes.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A thousand, as one, shall
flee at the rebuke of one.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Because the Jews, on
account of their vast numbers, relied on their forces. as men are wont to do
when they possess any power, therefore the Prophet threatens that all the
protection which they have at home will be of no more avail to them than foreign
aid, because the Lord will break and take away their courage, so that they shall
not be able to make use of their forces. For what avail arms and a vast
multitude of men? What avail fortresses and bulwarks, when men's hearts fail and
are dismayed? It is therefore impossible for us to be strong and powerful,
unless the Lord strengthen and uphold us by his Spirit. This statement occurs
frequently in the law, that when they should revolt from God, a vast number of
them would be put to flight by a very small number of enemies. But there is this
difference between the law and the prophets, that the prophets apply to a
particular subject what Moses announced in general terms, as we have formerly
explained.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F552</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">Here
two observations must be made. First, we shall have just as much courage as the
Lord shall give us; for we immediately lose heart, if he do not support us by
his power. Secondly, it is the result of the righteous vengeance of God, that we
are terrified by men, when he could not prevail upon us to fear him; that, when
we have despised God's word and warnings, we fall down in terror at the words
and threatenings of men. But we must also add, thirdly, God needs not extensive
preparations to chastise us; for, if he lift up but a finger against us, we are
undone. A small and feeble army will be sufficient to destroy us, even though we
be well prepared, and have great numbers on our side. Next, he threatens that
there will be no end to these calamities till they have been reduced to the last
extremity, and until, amidst the frightful desolation of the earth, but few
tokens of God's compassion are
left.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As the mast of a ship on
the top of a mountain.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This may be explained in
two ways. Some consider the metaphor to be taken from trees which have been cut
down; for, when a forest is cut down, lofty trees are left which may be of use
for building ships. But
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rh</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>har</i>,) "a mountain," probably denotes also a rock or promontory, against
which ships are dashed, and to which they adhere, and on which a "mast," the
emblem of shipwreck, is afterwards seen.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F553</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As
a banner on a hill.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Another metaphor is now
added, borrowed from trophies erected to commemorate the defeat of enemies. In
short, the Prophet declares that they will be so few that all that remains shall
be an indication of very great ruin. As if he had said, "This great multitude
which you now have dazzles your eyes; but there will be such ruin and decrease
that you shall no longer have the face of a people." We are thus reminded how
humbly and modestly we ought to conduct ourselves, even though we have great
wealth and numerous forces; for if our mind be puffed up, God will speedily beat
down our pride, and render us more feeble and cowardly than women and children,
so that we shall not be able to bear the sight even of a single enemy, and all
our strength shall melt away like snow.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore will Jehovah
wait.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet now adds consolation; for
hitherto he threatened to such an extent that almost all the godly might be
thrown into despair. He intended therefore to soothe their minds, and encourage
them to hope for better things, that they might embrace the mercy of God in the
midst of those miseries, and might thus nourish their souls by his word. He
contrasts this "waiting" with the excessive haste against which he spoke loudly
at the beginning of the chapter, where he reproved the people for noisy haste,
and condemned them for unbelief; but now, on the contrary, he reproaches them by
saying that the Lord will not render like for like in consequence of the
contempt with which they have treated him, and will not in that manner hasten to
punish them. Others explain it, "He commands you to wait," or "he will cause you
to wait." But the meaning which I have brought forward appears to me to be more
appropriate.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For Jehovah is a
God of judgment.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To make the former statement
more plain, we must lay down this principle, that God exercises moderation in
inflicting punishment, because he is inclined to mercy. This is what he means by
the word "judgment;" for it denotes not only punishment, but also the moderation
which is exercised in chastening. In like manner, Jeremiah
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Chasten me, O Lord, but
in judgment, not in thy wrath,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">lest
thou crush me."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;241024&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
10:24.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And again, I will not consume thee, but will chastise
thee in judgment.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F554</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;243011&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
30:11.) "Judgment" is thus contrasted with severity, when the Lord observes a
limit in punishing believers, that he may not ruin those whose salvation he
always promotes; and, accordingly, as Habakkuk says, "in the midst of wrath he
remembers his mercy."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;350302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
3:2.) He is not like us, therefore; he does not act with bustling or hurry,
otherwise at every moment we must perish, but he calmly waits. Nor is it a
slight confirmation of this when he adds, that God gives a proof of his glory by
pardoning his people.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
therefore will he be exalted, that he may be gracious to
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Others translate the words, "till he be
gracious to you;" but I think that the former translation is more appropriate,
and it agrees better with the meaning of the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>lamed</i>.) The Lord appears to lie still or to sleep, so long as he permits
his Church to be assailed by the outrages of wicked men; and the customary
language of Scripture is to say that he sits, or lies unemployed, when he does
not defend his Church. It might be thought that he lay still when he gave loose
reins to the Chaldeans to oppress the Jews; and therefore the Prophet says, that
the Lord will arise and ascend his judgment-seat. Why? "That he may be gracious
to you."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Blessed are all that
wait for him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is an inference from the
former statement, in which he called Jehovah "a God of judgment." While he thus
restrains himself, he draws from it an exhortation to patience and "waiting,"
and makes use of a part of the same verb, "wait," which he had formerly used.
They were chargeable with distrust, and were distressed by strange uneasiness
and restlessness of mind; for they were fearfully harassed by their unbelief, so
that they could not "wait" for God calmly. To cure this vice, he enjoins them to
"wait," that is, to hope. Now, hope is nothing else than steadfastness of faith,
that is, when we wait calmly till the Lord fulfill what he has promised. When he
says that they who shall patiently "wait" for him will be "blessed," he
declares, on the other hand, that they who allow themselves to be hurried away
by impatience, and do not repent of their crimes and their wickedness, are
wretched and miserable, and will at length perish; for without hope in God there
can be no salvation or happiness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Surely the people in Zion shall
dwell in Jerusalem.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He confirms the former
statement, that the people will indeed be afflicted, but will at length return
to "Zion." Now, this might be thought incredible after the desolation of the
city and of the whole country, for it seemed as if the whole nation had
perished; yet Isaiah promises that the Church shall be preserved. He begins with
Mount "Zion," on which the temple was built, and says that there men will
henceforth call on the Lord. He likewise adds, "in Jerusalem," by which he means
that the Church shall be enlarged and increased, and that all that had formerly
been laid waste shall be restored. Yet he intimates that "Jerusalem" shall again
be populous, because God had chosen it to be his
sanctuary.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Weeping thou shalt
not weep.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F555</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The meaning is, that this mourning shall not be perpetual. The Church, that is,
all believers, while they were in this wretched and distressed condition, must
have been exceedingly sorrowful; but he says that those tears shall come to an
end. To the same purport is it said by the Psalmist, "They who sow in tears
shall reap in joy."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19C605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
126:5.) The Lord permits us indeed to be afflicted with great anguish; but at
length he cheers us, and gives us reason for gladness, when he restores his
Church; for that is the true joy of believers. Besides, as it is difficult to
taste any consolation when the mind is overwhelmed by a conviction of God's
vengeance, he holds out a ground of consolation in the mercy of God, because,
when he is appeased, there is no reason to dread that joy and peace shall not
immediately return. But, as the Prophet Habakkuk says in the passage already
quoted, "in his wrath the Lord remembers mercy;" and he never punishes believers
with such severity as not to restrain and moderate his strokes, and put a limit
to his chastisements.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;350302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
3:2.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>At the voice of thy
cry.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet points out the manner of
obtaining pardon, in order to arouse believers to pray earnestly, and to
supplicate with earnest groanings; for if there be no repentance, if we do not
ask pardon from God, we are altogether unworthy of his mercy. If, therefore, we
wish that the Church should be gathered together, and rescued from destruction
by a kind of resurrection, let us cry to God to listen to our sighs and
groanings; and if there be no sorrow of heart that excites us to prayer, we have
no right to expect any
alleviation.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will answer
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This means nothing else than that he will
give evidence of his kindness and aid; for the Lord "answers," not by word, but
by deed. Yet let us not think that he will instantly comply with our wishes,
which are often hasty and unseasonable. He will undoubtedly assist us when the
proper time arrives, so that we shall know that he had in view our
salvation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When the Lord shall have given
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He continues the same subject, and
strengthens believers, that they may not faint; for patience springs from the
hope of a more prosperous issue. Accordingly, he prepares them for enduring
future chastisement, for the wrath of God will press hard on them for a time;
but he immediately promises that a joyful issue awaits them, when they shall
have endured those calamities and distresses; for God will restrain his
severity. Thus, I consider
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>vau</i>) to mean "When" or "After;" as if he had said, "<i>When</i> you
shall have endured those troubles, then will the Lord bless you; for he will
change your condition for the
better."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy rain shall no
longer be restrained.</i></font><font face="Palatino">

The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrwm</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>moreh</i>) is viewed by some commentators as meaning "a teacher." But this
does not agree with the context; for, although the chief fruit of our
reconciliation to God is to have faithful "teachers," yet, as the ignorant
multitude was more deeply affected by the want of food, Isaiah accommodates his
language to their ignorance, and gives them a taste of God's fatherly kindness
under the emblem of abundance of food.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By the
words "bread" and "water," he means extreme want and scarcity of all things, and
therefore he calls it "bread of anguish and water of affliction."
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F557</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Instead of this famine, he says that he will send them plenty and abundance.
This is what he means by the word <i>rain</i>; for he describes the cause
instead of the effect, as if he had said, "The earth shall yield fruit in
abundance." This had a literal and special reference to a country, the fertility
of which depended entirely on heaven; for it was not watered by rivers or
fountains, but by rains.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The land whither ye go

<div><font face="Palatino">He declares that the fruits of the earth, which the

of the copious "rains,"

there will be large and abundant produce. Thus, when the Lord shall punish us,
let us comfort our hearts with these statements and
promises.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then shall thine ears
hear.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It was indeed no despicable promise which
he made of an abundant produce of the fruits of the earth, but the chief ground
of gladness and joy is, when God restores to us pure and sound doctrine; for no
scarcity of wheat ought to terrify and alarm us so much as a scarcity of the
word; and indeed, in proportion as the soul is more excellent than the body, so
much the more ought we to dread this kind of famine, as another prophet also
reminds us.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;300811&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Amos
8:11.) Isaiah promises this to the Jews as the most valuable of all blessings,
that they shall be fed with the word, by the want of which they had formerly
been heavily afflicted. The false prophets also boast of the word, and in a more
haughty and disdainful manner than godly teachers: they wish to be reckoned and
declared to be the best guides; but they lead men into error, and at length
plunge them into destruction. But the word which points out the right path comes
from God alone, though it would be of little service to us, if he did not also
promise that he would give us ears; for otherwise he would speak to the deaf,
and we should hear nothing but a confused
sound</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A word behind
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> These words must be extended so far as to
mean that he will not permit what he speaks to us to be useless, but will
inwardly move our understandings and hearts, so as to train them to true
obedience; for by nature we are not willing to learn, and must be altogether
formed anew by his Spirit. The word <i>hear</i> is very emphatic. He compares
God to a schoolmaster, who places the children before his eyes, that he may more
effectually train and direct them; by which he expresses the wonderful affection
and care manifested towards us by God, who does not reckon it enough to go
before us, but also "with his eye upon us gives us direction."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
32:8.) But the Prophet declares that they who follow God as their guide will be
in no danger of going
astray.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Walk ye in
it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is an exhortation to cheerful
progress, so that their journey may not be retarded, as frequently happens, by
any uncertainty. What he adds, about <i>the right hand</i> and <i>the left</i>,
might be thought absurd; for when Moses pointed out to the people the way in
which they should walk, he at the same time charged them "not to turn aside to
the right hand or to the left."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050532&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
5:32; 17:20.) The road is straight and we ought not to seek any departures from
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What then does the Prophet mean? I reply, he
uses the words "Right" and "Left" in a different sense; for he means by them
every kind of transactions which we must undertake to perform. These are
various, as there are also various modes of living; and every person meets with
difficulties of many kinds, and is under the necessity of deliberating about
them. By the "right and left hand," therefore, he means all the actions of human
life, whatever they are, so that, in all that we undertake, we may have God for
our guide, and may always regulate our transactions by his authority, whether we
must go "to the right hand or to the left." And hence we derive very great
consolation, that the Lord will favor our undertakings, and will direct our
steps, to whatever hand we turn, provided only that we do not turn aside from
the path which he points out to us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then shall you profane the
covering. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This shews that the heavenly
direction will not be without effect; for they will bid adieu to their errors,
and devote their minds to the pure worship of God; and the Prophet expressly
mentions the outward profession of true godliness, by which they will openly
proclaim that they have renounced idolatry. For, since statues and images are
instruments of idolatry and superstition, they who are truly converted to God
detest and abhor them, and, as far as lies in their power, profane them as we
read that Jehu did, who profaned the altars of Baal, and turned his temple into
a common sewer.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121027&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 10:27.) The example given by him and by others of the same class ought to
be followed by godly princes and magistrates, if they wish to give a genuine
proof of their repentance; for, although repentance is seated in the heart, and
has God for a witness, it is shewn by its fruits. Isaiah has mentioned one class
of them instead of the whole; for in general he shews that the proof of true
repentance is, when men make it appear that they hold in abhorrence everything
that is opposed to the worship of God. When he says that the idols are profaned,
he does not mean that they were formerly sacred; for how could anything be
sacred that dishonors God, and defiles men by its pollution? But, as men falsely
imagine that they possess some sacredness, that is the reason why he says that
they are "profaned," and that they ought to be despised and rejected as things
of no value and altogether
unclean.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
covering</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F559</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the graven images of thy
silver.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When he speaks of the "silver" and
"gold" of the graven images, he means that no loss or damage prevents believers
from abhorring the worship of idols. Such considerations restrain many from
casting away idols altogether, because they see that "gold" or "silver" or
something else is lost, and they choose rather to keep their idols than to
sustain the smallest loss. Covetousness holds them in its net, so that they are
more willing to sin of their own accord, and to pollute themselves with these
abominations, than to lose this or that. But we ought to prefer the worship of
God to everything else, to set little value on gold, to cast away pearls, and to
loathe everything that is accounted precious, rather than defile ourselves with
such crimes. In short, nothing can be so valuable that it ought not to be
despised and reckoned worthless by us, when it comes into competition with
overturning the kingdom of Satan and restoring the worship of God. In this
manner we actually shew whether the love of God and of religion dwells in our
hearts, when a sincere abhorrence of our wicked ignorance drives us to throw
away all that is
polluted.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Then will he give rain to thy seed. </i></font><font face="Palatino">From the
fruit he again shews how desirable it is to be converted to God; for the fruit
of repentance is, that he receives converted persons into favor, and bestows his
blessing on them, so that they are in want of nothing, but, on the contrary, are
loaded with every kind of blessings. As troubles and distresses proceed from the
wrath of God, whom we provoke by our crimes, so, when he is pacified, everything
goes on prosperously with us, and we obtain every sort of kindness, as the Law
more fully testifies.

expect an abundant supply of food; but because he had not observed order in
beginning with earthly and fading blessings, he therefore now adds to doctrine,
which is spiritual nourishment, those things which belong to the use of this
corruptible life; for, although godliness has the promise of the present life as
well as "of that which is to come,"

6:33.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence also let us learn that it is in
vain for men to toil in cultivating their fields, if the Lord do not send rain
from heaven. Our labors must be watered by him, and he must "give the increase;"
otherwise they will be of no service. Yet we must not expect rain but from the
blessing of God; and if we receive abundant produce, we ought to give to him the
glory. Hence learn also that we shall be in want of nothing, and shall obtain
very abundant fruits of our labors, if we are converted to God, and that it is
our own fault that we often suffer poverty and want, because by our wickedness
we drive away from us the blessing of God. Let us not therefore ascribe
barrenness and famine to any other causes than to our own fault; for it is
impossible that there should be so great a multitude of men as to be incapable
of deriving support and nourishment from the earth; but by our iniquities and
transgressions we shut the bosom of the earth, which would otherwise be laid
open to us, and would abundantly yield fruits of every description, that we
might lead a prosperous and happy
life.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thy cattle shall
feed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What he now adds about the "cattle" tends
greatly to magnify the grace of God; for if his kindness overflows even on the
dumb cattle,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
36:6,) how much more on men whom "he created after his image."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010127&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
1:27.) But we need not wonder if brute beasts, which were created for the use of
men, suffer hunger along with their masters, and that they have a share in the
bestowal of favor when God is reconciled to
men.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thine oxen
also.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When he promises that the oxen and the
asses shall eat abundant and clean provender, this is a repetition and
confirmation of what was stated in the preceding verse. This passage is taken
from the Law,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;052811&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
28:11,) and is gladly and frequently quoted by the prophets, in order that we
may learn to discern in the sickness and death of cattle the indignation of God,
and to desire more earnestly to be reconciled to him, that our houses may be
filled with his goodness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it shall come to
pass.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When the prophets describe the kingdom of
Christ, they commonly draw metaphors from the ordinary life of men; for the true
happiness of the children of God cannot be described in any other way than by
holding out an image of those things which fall under our bodily senses, and
from which men form their ideas of a happy and prosperous condition. It amounts
therefore to this, that they who obey God, and submit to Christ as their king,
shall be blessed. Now, we must not judge of this happiness from abundance and
plenty of outward blessings, of which believers often endure scarcity, and yet
do not on that account cease to be blessed. But those expressions are
allegorical, and are accommodated by the Prophet to our ignorance, that we may
know, by means of those things which are perceived by our senses, those
blessings which have so great and surpassing excellence that our minds cannot
comprehend them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And on every
high hill there shall be streams.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When he says
that "on the mountains" there shall be "streams and rivulets," he gives a still
more striking view of that plenty and abundance with which the Lord will enrich
his people. Water is not plentiful on the peaks of the mountains, which are
exceedingly dry; the valleys are indeed well moistened, and abound in water; but
it is very uncommon for water to flow abundantly on the tops of the mountains.
Yet the Lord promises that it shall be so, though it appear to be impossible;
but by this mode of expression he foretells that, under the reign of Christ, we
shall be happy in every respect, and that there will be no place in which there
shall not be an abundant supply of blessings of every description; that nothing
will be so barren as not to be rendered fruitful by his kindness, so that
everywhere we may be happy. This is what we should actually experience, if we
were fully under the authority of Christ. We should plainly see his blessing on
all sides, if we sincerely and honestly obeyed him; everything would go on to
our wish; and the whole world and everything in it would contribute to our
comfort; but, because we are very far from yielding that obedience, we have only
a slight taste of those blessings, and enjoy them so far as we have advanced in
newness of life.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By the day of
slaughter,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is denoted another mark of the
divine favor, that God will keep his people safe and sound against the violence
of enemies; and in this way the Prophet gives credibility to the former
prediction; for otherwise it would have been difficult to believe that captives
and exiles would enjoy such prosperity. Here he speaks therefore of the
slaughter of the wicked; as if he had said, "The Lord will not only do you good,
but will also drive out your enemies." It is generally thought that the Prophet
now speaks of the defeat which befell the wicked king Sennacherib when he
besieged Jerusalem.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121935&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 19:35;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233736&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
37:36.) But when I examine it more closely, I am more disposed to view this
passage as referring to the destruction of Babylon; for although a vast
multitude of persons was slain, when Sennacherib was shamefully put to flight,
yet still the people were not delivered. This reminds us that we ought not to
despair, even though our enemies be very numerous, and leave abundance of
garrisons, troops, and fortifications; for the Lord can easily put them to
flight and defend his Church. Let us not be terrified at their power or rage, or
be discouraged because we are few in number; for neither their troops, nor their
bulwarks, nor their rage and insolence, will hinder them from falling into the
hands of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the light of the moon
shall be. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet was not satisfied with
describing an ordinary state of prosperity, without adding something
extraordinary; for he says that the Lord will go beyond the course of nature in
this kindness and liberality. It never happened that the brightness of "the sun"
was increased, unless when "the sun" stood still in the days of Joshua, in order
to give time for pursuing the enemies,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;061012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joshua
10:12,13,) and when, for the sake of Hezekiah, the dial went backward.

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F560</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Besides, the Prophet does not speak about prolonging the course of "the sun"
above our horizon, but about increasing its brightness <i>sevenfold</i>. He
shews what will be the condition of the godly under the reign of Christ; for in
other respects the Lord</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"maketh his sun to shine

5:45.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here he speaks of happiness in which ungodly men
can have no share. There is one kind of liberality which is bestowed
indiscriminately on all, and another kind which is peculiar to believers alone;
as it is said, "Great is the abundance of thy goodness which thou hast laid up
for them that fear thee."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193119&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
31:19.) Isaiah speaks of this special favor,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F561</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and, in order to describe it, borrows metaphors from well-known objects.
Accordingly, he declares that God will enlighten believers with so great
brightness that, if "seven" suns were brought together, their brightness would
be far inferior to this.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When
the Lord shall have bound up the breach of his
people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> That the weight of afflictions, by
which the people were soon afterwards overwhelmed, might not hinder them from
believing this statement, he likewise adds another promise, that the Lord will
be like a physician to heal their wounds. Hence it follows, that the people must
be chastened, and, in some measure, prepared for repentant by wounds, and must
even be crushed and bruised in such a manner as to be reduced almost to
nothing.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And healed the stroke
of their wound.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What he now adds about a
"stroke," is intended to shew that this bruising will not be slight; for it
resembles a body beaten and wounded by many strokes. If therefore we shall be
ready at any time to think that the Lord deals harshly with us, let us call to
remembrance those predictions, that the Lord will "bind up our wounds," which
otherwise might appear to be mortal. And if any one ask why the Lord chastises
his people so severely, I reply, that it produces no good effect on us when he
treats us mildly; our vices are deeply rooted, and adhere to our very marrow,
and cannot be separated but by a razor which has a sharp and keen
edge.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold the name of the Lord
cometh.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He threatens the destruction of the
Assyrians, who were at that time the chief enemies of the Church. From almost
all their neighbors, indeed, the Jews received annoyance; but as the Assyrians
were greatly superior to others in wealth and power, so the prophets, when they
speak of enemies, mention them almost exclusively, and afterwards the
Babylonians, who obtained the monarchy; though, as we have already seen, they
frequently, by a figure of speech in which a part is taken for the whole,
include the Chaldeans under the name of Assyrians. By "the name of God" he
unquestionably means God himself; but he makes use of this circumlocution,
because the Assyrians and other nations worshipped gods made of gold and silver,
and held up the Jews to ridicule, because they did not worship him under any
image, or statue, or resemblance; as one who wrote against them says that "they
worship the bright clouds and the deity of the sky."
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F562</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Thus wicked and ungodly men always judge of God according to outward
appearances; while the prophets, on the other hand, remind believers of "the
name of God." "That God who revealed himself to you by his name, whom you do not
feel, whom you do not see, will take vengeance on your
insults."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From
afar.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He adds this as if he granted what was
said by them; for ungodly men, when they do not perceive the hand of God, think
that he is at a great distance, and mock at the confidence of believers as
groundless. Accordingly, the Prophet, adapting his language to the views of
unbelievers, shews that God, whom they thought to be at a great distance, will
come, or rather, has already come, and is at hand. This is what he means by the
particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnh</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>hinneh</i>,) <i>behold</i>, which he contrasts with the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qhrmm</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>mimmerhok</i>,) "from afar," directing believers, in this manner, to rise
above all obstructions, that by their hope they may arrive at that assistance
which he promised.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His face
burneth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In order to shew that the celebration
of the name of God in Judea is not vain or groundless, the Prophet describes the
power of God, that is, the power which he will employ in driving out the enemies
of the Church, as dreadful. When he addresses those who believe in him, in order
to encourage them to the exercise of faith, he shews himself to be kind, gentle,
patient, slow to anger, and merciful; but to the ungodly he holds out nothing
but fear and terror.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;023406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
34:6.) And as the ungodly are terrified when God is mentioned, so believers,
drawn by a conviction of his goodness, rely on him, and are not distressed by
such fears. This shews us that we ought continually to persevere in the fear of
God, that we may not find God to be what he is here described by the
Prophet.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His burden is
heavy.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F563</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
That is, the Lord will bring with him dreadful calamities, which the ungodly
will not be able to endure; for by "burdens" he means the punishments which are
inflicted on the ungodly. He expresses the same thing by the words <i>lips</i>
and <i>tongue</i>. But why did he speak of them rather than of the hands? It is,
because ungodly men mock at all the threatenings which are uttered by the word
of God, and treat as fabulous all that is declared by the prophets. To their own
cost, therefore, they shall learn that the sound which proceedeth from the
sacred name of God is not without meaning, and is not idle thunder intended
merely to strike the ears, but shall at length know by experience what is the
power of that word which they
despised.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.</b>

Spirit.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F564</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He proceeds with that threatening which he had begun to utter, namely, that the
Church will indeed be chastised, but yet that the Assyrians shall utterly
perish; for he says that they will be plunged into the deep by the "Spirit" of
God, or rather, that the "Spirit" himself is like a deep torrent which shall
swallow them up. Others translate

wind.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And with a useless

"sieve," which is very frequent in Scripture
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
3:12.) He says that he will shake the Assyrians with a sieve, in order to thrash
and scatter them; and therefore he calls it "the sieve of vanity," that is, a
useless sieve,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F566</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
intended not to preserve, but to destroy; for, in another sense, the Lord is
wont to "sift" his own people also, so as to gather them like good grain into
the barn.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And a bridle causing
to err.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F567</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The third metaphor is that of a "bridle," by which the Lord continually
restrains the pride and rebelliousness of wicked men, and, in a word, shews that
he is their Judge. True, indeed, the Lord commonly restrains and subdues his own
people by a "bridle," but it is in order to bring them to obedience; while, on
the other hand, he restrains wicked men in such a manner as to cast them down
headlong to destruction. This is what he means by the phrase "causing to err."
As furious horses are driven about in all directions by their riders, and, the
more they kick are more violently struck and beaten; so the ungodly, when they
are kept back, rush eagerly in the opposite direction, as it is beautifully
described by David.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
32:9.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">The object of these metaphors is to shew
that we must not sport with the Lord; for, although he appear for a time to act
differently, we shall at length know by experience the truth of what the Prophet
says, that his "breath" alone will be like a torrent to cast down the wicked,
that they may be suddenly overwhelmed. Next, when he gives warning that the
nations shall be winnowed with "a useless sieve," we ought to fear lest the
Lord, if he find in us nothing but chaff, throw us on the dunghill. Lastly, we
must observe the difference that exists between the children of God and the
reprobate; for the Lord chastises both, but in different ways &#8212; the
children of God, that they may be purified and preserved &#8212; and the
reprobate, that they may be cast down headlong and
destroyed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And you shall have a song as
in the night.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he declares that all the
punishments which he threatened against the Assyrians shall tend to the
advantage of the Church, because the Lord punishes the outrages committed
against his people not less severely than if they had been committed against
himself. In this way he testifies his infinite love and kindness towards his own
people, when he deigns to take up arms on their behalf. Hence we ought to
conclude, that all the threatenings which are found in any part of Scripture
tend to the consolation of
believers.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When a festival is
kept.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He says that this "song" will be sacred,
and compares it to a "holy solemnity," in order to excite believers to
thankfulness, and to shew that their joy should be directed to God; for it is
not enough to rejoice, unless our joy look straight towards God, and unless we
keep him alone always in our view; otherwise our joy will be fruitless and
irreligious, and will not promote our salvation, or be acceptable to God. He
calls it "a song <i>of the night</i>," because the Jews began the day at sunset,
and, as soon as the evening came, celebrated the
festival.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the
mountain.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He explains more fully of what nature
this joy shall be. They shall not dance, as irreligious men do, but shall raise
and fix their eyes on God, whom they acknowledge to be the author of every
blessing. By "the mountain" he means the temple which was built "on the
mountain." He calls God </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
Mighty One of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because it was by his
assistance that they had been redeemed and preserved; and hence he reminds them
that in future they will not be safe in any other way than by placing their hope
in God alone. And indeed, when we cherish any conviction of our own strength, we
rob God of this title, which is truly and sincerely bestowed on him by none but
the lowly and humble, who have laid aside all confidence in their own
strength.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jehovah shall cause to be
heard.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He confirms what he formerly said about
the judgment of God on the Assyrians, and he describes it figuratively, as is
very customary both with himself and with the other prophets. When God delays,
and does not immediately punish the wicked, we think that he is either asleep or
not powerful, and are distracted by doubt and uncertainty. And if we behold some
of his judgments, yet such is our natural stupidity, or rather our ingratitude,
that we keep before us those masks which hinder us from perceiving the glory of
God; for we ascribe it to fortune, or to the plans and contrivances and strength
of men, and never, unless when we are compelled, acknowledge that we owe
anything to God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The power of
his voice.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F568</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For the reasons now stated, the Prophet was not satisfied with having once
foretold the vengeance of God against the Assyrians; but he likewise describes
it in a lively manner, and repeats it with great earnestness. He declares that
the destruction shall be such that men will be constrained to hear "the voice of
God;" that is, to acknowledge his judgment, and to confess that this calamity
hath proceeded from him, as if he had spoken openly. The matter, therefore, may
be thus summed up. The event will be so manifest, that there shall be no one who
does not understand that this calamity proceeded from "the mouth," that is, from
the decree of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the
descent of his arm shall he cause to be seen.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
He begins with "the voice of God," that we may know that he directs by his
authority everything that is done on the earth. Yet at the same time he applauds
the power of his doctrine, on which it was necessary that his people should
rely, in order that the effect might be openly displayed at the proper time. But
as the work quickly follows the decree and "voice of God," he adds "the descent
of his arm." These two things ought always to be joined together; for we ought
not to imagine that God is like men, or that he suddenly undertakes anything,
and then leaves it defective or incomplete. Whatever he has decreed he likewise
executes, and his hand can never be separated from his mouth. On the other hand,
he executes nothing at random, but all must have been previously decreed, so
that all the punishments which he inflicts are so many displays of righteous
judgment.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With deluge and
hailstone.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> That vengeance is illustrated, in
the conclusion of the verse, by figures, in order that its terrific character
may lead the Jews more cheerfully to raise their faith on high; for it was
highly consolatory to them to know that, though they were heavily afflicted, a
far more dreadful judgment would soon fall on their enemies. And yet we must not
dream, as the Rabbins do, that the Assyrians were struck by a thunderbolt, for
their conjecture is excessively frivolous. On the contrary, the Prophet follows
the ordinary custom, and, by means of these comparisons, describes the judgment
of God, which our prodigious dulness makes us excessively slow to comprehend.
Conflagrations, thunderbolts, inundations, and deluges, are somewhat unusual and
monstrous events, and thus produce a stronger impression on our own minds. For
this reason, the prophets draw a comparison from them, that men may perceive the
dreadful and avenging hand of God against the
wicked.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Surely by the voice of
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He added this for two reasons; first,
to shew why the Assyrian must be bruised; for, since he was cruel and savage to
others, it is proper that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"the same measure which
he meted should be measured</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">to him
again."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
7:2.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is the ordinary judgment of God against tyrants,
as the Prophet says in a subsequent passage of this book,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Woe to thee that
spoilest, for thou shalt be
spoiled."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
33:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The second reason is, because the power of the
Assyrian king appeared to be so great that he could not fall. Although,
therefore, he was fortified on every hand, not only to defend himself, but also
to attack others, yet the Prophet says, that "by the voice of God" alone he
shall be bruised. Hence we learn how groundless is the confidence of wicked men,
who rely on their garrisons and arms, and presumptuously despise God, as if they
had not been liable to his judgment. But in order to destroy them, the Lord will
have no need of any other arms than his own "voice;" for by the slightest
expression of his will he will lay them low. Nor can it be doubted that the
Prophet intends to withdraw the minds of believers from earthly means, that they
may not inquire how it shall be done, but may be satisfied with the bare promise
of God, who is fully able to execute his word as soon as it has gone forth from
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>32.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And there shall be in every
passage</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He means that the Assyrians will in
vain try every method of escaping from the hand of God; for wherever they go,
whether they attempt to go forward or to turn back, the hand of God shall pursue
them. As to the phrase, <i>fastened</i> <i>staff</i>,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F569</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
I readily adopt the opinion of those who think that the metaphor is taken from
those on whom have been inflicted strokes so heavy, that the marks of the
instrument of punishment remain, as if a rod or staff were "fastened" in the
wound. It will perhaps be thought preferable to interpret it to mean, that the
wound is "fastened"
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F570</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
on the Assyrian, as a foundation is fixed in the earth; for what is not
"fastened" may be moved out of its place and carried away. But he shews that
that wound is so deeply fixed that it cannot be shaken off or removed. In like
manner, the weight of God's wrath lies on the reprobate, and holds them weighed
down to the end. To shew that there is no hope of being able to derive advantage
from a change of place, he says <i>everywhere</i>, thus declaring that there
shall be no retreat. The clause ought to be thus arranged, "wherever the staff
shall pass, there it will stick
firmly."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With tabrets and
harps.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He means that the issue of the battle
will not be doubtful, as when the combatants meet on equal terms; for he says
that the victory will be certain; because, as soon as God determines to go forth
to fight, he already holds the victory in his hand. "Tabrets and harps," hands
spread out and lifted up, are expressive of the joy of conquerors, when they
shout aloud and chant the song of
victory.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall fight against
her.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The feminine pronoun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hb</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>bahh</i>) is viewed by some commentators as referring to the army; but the
Prophet undoubtedly intended to express something higher, namely, the head of
the army, that is, Babylon, as contrasted with Jerusalem, which also he formerly
denoted by a similar pronoun.</font><br><font face="Palatino">From these
statements we ought to infer, that the wicked shall at length be destroyed,
though they appear to have many means of escape; for wherever they turn,
whatever road they take, the "staff" of the Lord shall pursue them, and shall
ever remain "fastened" to their back; they shall never escape his hand or get
quit of their wounds. We, too, are chastened by the hand of God, but the wounds
do not always last; our pains are soothed and abated, and "our grief is turned
into joy."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431620&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
16:20.) Besides, God carries on war against the reprobate in such a manner that
they cannot resist him, or gain anything by their attempts. He joins battle with
them, indeed, but it is as a conqueror; he even allows them to obtain some
advantages, but represses their insolence whenever he thinks proper. If,
therefore, we fight under his banner, let us entertain no doubt of obtaining the
victory; for, when we have him as our leader, we shall be safe from all danger,
and shall undoubtedly come off
conquerors.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>33.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For Tophet is
ordained.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet goes on to threaten the
vengeance of God, and says that not only a temporary calamity, but also
everlasting destruction awaits the wicked; for hell is prepared for them, and
not merely for persons of ordinary rank, but likewise for the king himself and
the nobles. By "Tophet" he unquestionably means Hell; not that we must fancy to
ourselves some place in which the wicked are shut up, as in a prison, after
their death, in order to endure the torments which they deserve; but it denotes
their miserable condition and excruciating torments. In the book of Kings, it
denotes that place where the Jews sacrificed their children to the idol Moloch.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;122310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 23:10.) It is also mentioned by Jeremiah,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;241906&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
19:6;) and that place was destroyed and profaned by Josiah on account of the
detestable superstition committed in it.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;122310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 23:10.) The prophets, I have no doubt, intended to give the name of this
place to the punishments and torments of the wicked, in order that the bare
mention of it might excite horror in godly persons, and that idolatry might be
universally regarded with greater abhorrence. The word "Gehenna"
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F571</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
has the same etymology; for "the Valley of Hinnom" was a name given to Hell
(Gehenna) on account of the abominable sacrilege practiced in
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Since
yesterday.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F572</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
When we see that all goes well with the wicked, and that they have everything to
their wish, we think that they will pass unpunished. For this reason the
Prophet, on the contrary, exclaims: "Since yesterday, that is, of old since the
beginning of the world, the Lord hath determined what punishments he shall
inflict on them." Though this decree is still hidden from us, yet it must be
certain, and cannot fail. Let us not, therefore, judge of the lot of the wicked
according to outward appearances; let us wait for the Lord, who in due time will
execute his righteous judgment. Yet let us not be rash, or think that God hath
forgotten to take vengeance; for he had determined what he should do before it
could enter into our mind; nor can we so speedily desire the destruction of the
wicked as not to have our thoughts and desires anticipated long before by the
Lord, for from the beginning he determined to inflict on them punishments and
torments. Some think that it is a parallel passage to that of the Apostle,
"Christ yesterday, to-day, and for ever."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
13:8.) But I consider "yesterday" to be here used simply as contrasted with our
thoughts, that we may not think that we possess so much wisdom as to be capable
of anticipating God: for there is nothing sudden in his purposes, but all were
long ago settled and determined by him. He speaks of the punishments of the life
to come, as I have already said, that is, of the punishments which the wicked
shall endure, in addition to the distresses which they suffer in this life. On
this subject it is strange that the Sadducees
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402223&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
22:23;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;442308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
23:8) were so dull and stupid as to confine rewards and punishments within the
limits of this life, as if the judgment of God did not extend beyond this world;
for the modes of expression which immediately follow would not apply to temporal
punishments, and the very name "Tophet," taken metaphorically, could denote
nothing else than God's highest
curse.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yea, for the king it is
prepared.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He shews that not even "kings," who
are supposed to be entitled, on account of their majesty and power, to enjoy
some peculiar privilege, are exempted from this punishment. Their greatness
dazzles the eyes of men, but will yield them no defense, so as to prevent the
Lord from punishing them as they deserve.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He
says that the slaughter of them will be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in a deep
place,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that we may know that they cannot escape
or be rescued from it; and he calls hell <i>broad</i>, that we may know that
however numerous they may be, though they all conspire together, they shall
likewise perish; for the Lord will not be exhausted by punishing, and he will
have a place so large as to contain all his
enemies.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The pile of it is
fire.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He speaks metaphorically concerning the
destruction of the reprobate, which otherwise we cannot sufficiently comprehend,
in the same manner as we do not understand the blessed and immortal life, unless
it be shadowed out by some figures adapted to our capacity. Hence it is evident
how foolish and absurd the sophists are, who enter into subtle arguments about
the nature and quality of that fire, and torture themselves by giving various
explanations of it. Such gross imaginations must be banished, since we know that
the Prophet speaks figuratively; and in another passage
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;236624&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Woe to them that go down to
Egypt.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He again returns to the subject which he
had handled at the beginning of the former chapter; for he still cries loudly
against the Jews, whose ordinary custom it was, in seasons of danger, to resort,
not to the Lord, but to the Egyptians. We have formerly explained why this was
so highly displeasing to God. To state the matter briefly, there are two reasons
why the Prophet reproves this crime so severely. The first is, because it is
impossible for us to place confidence for our salvation in creatures, and at the
same time in God; for our eyes must be withdrawn from him as soon as they are
directed to them. The second reason is, God had expressly forbidden them to
enter into alliance with the Egyptians.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051716&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
17:16.) To sinful confidence was added rebelliousness, as if they had resolved
to provide for their safety by despising God, and by disobeying his
will.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We must therefore look at the source of
this evil, if we wish to understand fully the Prophet's meaning. There was also
a peculiar reason, as we have formerly remarked, why the Lord wished the Jews to
have no intercourse with the Egyptians. It was, lest that wicked alliance should
obliterate the remembrance of the redemption from Egypt, and lest they should be
corrupted by the superstitions and sinful idolatry of the Egyptians. Yet these
arguments were regarded by them as of no weight; and, though God had forbidden
it, this did not hinder them from continually applying to them for assistance,
and imagining that their assistance was a shield which defended them against the
arm of God. Consequently, there are good reasons why the Prophet exclaims so
earnestly against such madness. Even on the ground that God had forbidden it,
their "going down into Egypt" deserved to be severely blamed; but it was still
more intolerably criminal, that by false confidence they bestowed on mortal men
the glory which was due to God. In order to make it still more clear that in
this manner they defraud God of his right, he not only accuses them of having
relied on the Egyptians, but likewise brings a charge against them, on the other
hand, that</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have not
looked to the Holy One of Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here appears
more clearly the reason why that treachery of the Jews is so sharply reproved by
Isaiah; for in other respects God does not disapprove of our using lawful
remedies, just as we eat bread and other kinds of food which were intended for
our use. Thus if any person, placed in danger, employ means which were not
forbidden, but which are customary and lawful, provided that he do not at all
deny the power of God, he certainly ought not to be blamed; but if we are so
strongly attached to outward means, that we do not at the same time seek God,
and if, through distrust of his promises, we resort to unlawful methods, this is
worthy of condemnation and abhorrence.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The word
<i>look</i> is frequently employed in Scripture to denote this confidence; for
we commonly turn our eyes towards that quarter from which we expect assistance.
In a word, we are here taught that we ought to place our trust for salvation in
none other than in God alone, that, relying on his promises, we may boldly ask
from him whatever is desirable. He undoubtedly permits us to use all things
which he intended for our use, but in such a manner that our minds must be
entirely fixed on him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he calls God "the
Holy One of Israel," he presents in a striking light the wickedness and
ingratitude of the people, who, after having been taken under God's protection
and guardianship, despised such a protector and guardian of their salvation, and
ran eagerly after their own lusts. By immediately adding,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>neither have they sought
Jehovah,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he shews that neither the power, nor
the goodness, nor the fatherly kindness of God, could keep them in the discharge
of their duty. In the present day, since he invites us not less kindly to come
to him, we offer a grievous insult to him if we look to any other, and do not
resolve to trust in him alone; and everything that shall turn away and withdraw
our minds from God will be to us like
"Egypt."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yet he also is
wise.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By calling God "wise," he does not merely
bestow on him the honor of an attribute which always belongs to him, but
censures the craftiness of those whom he saw to be too much delighted with their
own wisdom. He said a little before,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;232915&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
29:15,) that they "dug caves for themselves," when they thought that, by hidden
plans and secret contrivances, they avoided and deceived the eyes of God. He now
pours witty ridicule on this madness, by affirming that, on the other hand,
wisdom belongs also to God; indirectly bringing against them the charge of
believing that they could shut God's mouth as not knowing their affairs. As if
he had said, "What shall become of your wisdom?" Will the effect of it be that
God shall cease to be "wise?" On the contrary, by reproving your vanity, he will
give practical demonstration that "he taketh the wise in their own craftiness."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;180513&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
5:13;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460319&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 3:19.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">We may draw from this a
general doctrine, that they who shelter themselves under craftiness and secret
contrivances, gain nothing but to provoke still more the wrath of God. A bad
conscience always flees from the judgment of God, and seeks lurking-places to
conceal itself. Wicked men contrive various methods of guarding and fortifying
themselves against God, and think that they are wise and circumspect, even
though they be covered only with empty masks; while others, blinded by their
elevated rank, despise God and his threatenings. Thus, by declaring that "God is
also wise," the Prophet wounds them painfully and sharply, that they may not lay
claim to so great craftiness as to be capable of imposing on God by their
delusions.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will arise
against the house of the evil-doers.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As they
did not deserve that he should reason with them, he threatens that they shall
feel that God has his arguments at his command, for ensnaring transgressors.
First, they did not think that God has sufficient foresight, because he did not,
according to the ordinary practice of the world, provide for their safety amidst
so great dangers, and because they considered all threatenings to be empty
bugbears, as if they had it in their power by some means to guard against them.
Hence arises their eagerness to make every exertion, and their hardihood to plot
contrivances. He therefore threatens that God will take revenge on so gross an
insult, and that he has at his command the means of executing what he has
promised; and that no schemes, inventions, or craftiness can overthrow the word
of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Of the workers of
vanity.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F573</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He gives them this appellation, because they wished to fortify themselves
against the hand of God by a useless defense; that is, by the unlawful aid of
the Egyptians. Formerly, it might be thought that he silently admitted their
claim to the appellation of "wise men," by contrasting them with the wisdom of
God; but now he scatters the smoke, and openly displays their shame and
disgrace. This teaches us that there is nothing better than to renounce our own
judgment, and to submit entirely to God; because all that earnest caution by
which wicked men torture themselves has no solidity, but, on the contrary, as if
on purpose, provokes the wrath of God by the deceitful contrivances of the
flesh.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And surely the Egyptian is a man,
and not God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It may be thought that Isaiah here
brings forward nothing but what is common and beyond all doubt; for who ever
imagined that the Egyptians were not "men," and must be put in the place of
"God?" There is indeed no debate on this point, and it is openly acknowledged;
but when it is found necessary to reduce it to practice, men are altogether dull
of apprehension, or remain uncertain about that which they formerly appeared to
know and firmly to believe. They exalt themselves as highly, and claim as much
for themselves, as if they did not believe that they are men, and did not think
that they ought to obey God. This is the reason why Scripture so frequently
warns</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"not to trust in men,
than whom nothing can be more
vain."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19E603&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm

17:5.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet we see both princes and men of ordinary rank
contrive and resolve in such a manner as if they could establish for a hundred
years all that they contrived, and could subject heaven, sea, and earth, and
could regulate and dispose everything according to their will. When we perceive
in men such pride and arrogance, we need not wonder that the Prophet exclaims
that "the Egyptians are men, and not God;" for the Jews ascribed to them what
ought to be ascribed to God, the defense and preservation of the Church, which
God claims for himself alone, and does not allow to be given to another. Isaiah
therefore indirectly censures that contempt of God and wicked confidence by
which they are swelled with pride.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here we see
how great a difference there is between God and men; for men have no power in
themselves but what God has granted to them. If we were reasoning about the
nature and excellence of man, we might bring forward the singular gifts which he
has received from God; but when he is contrasted with God, he must be reduced to
nothing; for nothing can be ascribed to man without taking it from God. And this
is the reason why we cannot agree with the Papists, when we argue about the
cause of salvation, freewill, the value of works, and merits; for since on this
subject God is contrasted with man, we must take from God whatever is attributed
to man. But they make a division between man and God, so as to assign one part
to God, and another part to man; while we say, that the whole and undivided
cause of salvation must be ascribed to God, and that no part of it can be
attributed to another without detestable sacrilege. In a word, let us learn that
in such a contrast nothing worthy of praise can be left for
man.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And their horses are
flesh and not spirit.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By the word flesh he
means weakness and frailty; for what is there in "flesh" but corruption? He
speaks of "horses," but to the Egyptians also belongs a weakness of the same or
of a kindred nature; as if he had said that they, and all their forces, have
nothing that is solid or permanent. Although the Egyptians had a soul as well as
a body, yet, so far as they were creatures, and dwelt in a frail tabernacle,
they must hold an inferior rank; as if he had said, that they do not possess
heavenly or spiritual power; as it is said also in the Psalm,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Do not trust in princes;
for their breath shall go out, and they shall return to their earth."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19E603&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
146:3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So far as relates to "horses," the word "flesh"
applies to them with greater propriety; but it is not wonderful that men are
sent to learn from rottenness how frail they
are.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As soon as Jehovah shall
stretch out his arm.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> From this threatening we
may draw a universal doctrine, that this wickedness shall not pass unpunished;
for the Lord will not suffer men with impunity to give to creatures the honor
due to him, or to rely on the assistance of men with that confidence which ought
to be placed on him alone. He therefore threatens those who shall yield
assistance and give occasion to false confidence, as well as those who shall
make use of their assistance and rely on it for their safety. And if the Lord
cannot endure this wicked confidence, where nothing more than temporal safety is
concerned, how much less will he endure those who, in order to obtain eternal
salvation, contrive various aids according to their own fancy, and thus elevate
the power of men, so as to ascribe to it the place and authority of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thus hath Jehovah said to
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet adds this verse, that it may
not be thought that the Lord leaves us destitute of necessary means; for if,
while he forbids us to place our confidence in creatures, he did not promise us
any assistance, we might complain that he gave ground for despair, and not for
consolation; as we saw, a little before, that men are more careful and attentive
than they ought to be, because they think that they will be deficient in
thoughtfulness, if they rest satisfied with God alone, and abstain from
forbidden means. He therefore takes away every excuse, when he promises that he
will be a faithful guardian to us; for what pretense can be left, if we despise
the salvation which he offers to us of his own accord? It is therefore as if he
had said, "The Lord assists, and will assist; he forbids you to ask assistance
from the Egyptians." By comparing himself to a <i>lion</i>, a very powerful
animal and keenly bent on prey, he employs a very appropriate comparison, to
shew that he is in the highest degree both able and willing to defend
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the second part of the comparison, the
Prophet dwells largely on the great eagerness with which the Lord takes hold of
his people, keeps them near himself, preserves them from being carried off, and
defends them against all dangers; while he also points out that strength and
power which no arms and no forces can resist. Now, it is impossible that
comparisons should hold on every point, nor is it necessary, but they ought to
be suitable to the subject which is handled. Since therefore we know that the
Lord loves us so much and takes such care of us, must we not be worse than mad
if we despise him, and seek other aids, which will not only be useless but
destructive to us?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As birds that
fly.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is the second comparison, by which
the Prophet shews how great care the Lord takes of us, and how earnestly he is
bent on making us happy. It is taken from <i>birds</i>, which are prompted by
astonishing eagerness to preserve their young; for they almost kill themselves
with hunger, and shrink from no danger, that they may defend and preserve their
young. Moses makes use of the same comparison when, reproaching the people for
their ingratitude, he compares the Lord to an eagle</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"laying her nest,
spreading her wings, and fluttering over her young."

23:37.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sum of this passage is, that the Lord will be
sufficiently powerful to defend his people, for whom he has a special love and a
peculiar care. What Moses relates that God did, Isaiah promises that he will
always do; for he will never forsake those whom he has once received into his
favor. Lest any one therefore should imagine that this statement related only to
the men of a single age, he expressly declares that God will spread his wings to
defend Jerusalem. Nor is it unnecessarily that he mentions not only <i>Mount
Zion</i> but <i>its hill</i>; for on that "hill" was built the temple in which
God desired that men should call upon him. Wherever therefore the worship of God
is pure, let us know that salvation will be certain; for men cannot call upon
him in vain.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Return.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
This verse is explained in various ways; for the Hebrew commentators explain it
thus, "Return to the Lord, for you have multiplied revolts." But, in my opinion,
the meaning is more simple: "Return according as you have made a deep revolt;

for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;al</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>laasher</i>) is, I think, employed in the same sense as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;ak</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>kaasher</i>), "according as."
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F575</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He means that the aggravated nature of their wickedness does not shut the door
against them from returning to God, if they repent; that, although they have
been sunk into the deepest wickedness, still God will pardon them. Yet, at the
same time, he makes use of this spur to stimulate them to earnest grief and
hatred of their sins, that they may not carelessly and lightly, as frequently
happens, aim at a half repentance. He therefore bids them consider attentively
with what fearful destruction they have cast themselves down to hell, that they
may abhor themselves on account of their aggravated
transgressions.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It ought first to be observed,
that the Prophet does not lessen the guilt of the people. They who need to be
brought back to the Lord must first be made to have a deep and painful
conviction of their guilt; for they who flatter themselves in their iniquities
are very far from obtaining pardon, and therefore there is nothing better than
to lay open the alarming nature of the disease, when a remedy must be applied.
Yet, that their hearts may not be led to despair, they must be encouraged and
comforted by holding out to them the mercy of God; for Satan aims at nothing
else than to cut us off from all hope of pardon. Accordingly, Isaiah declares
that, although by their wickedness they have sunk down to hell, God is ready to
forgive; for not in vain does the Lord invite us to repentance, but he likewise
offers pardon. Hence also, to such exhortations the Scripture always adds
promises of grace, that, whenever we are called to repentance, we may know that
the hope of pardon is also held out to
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As you have made a deep
revolt.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Instead of this rendering, the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qm[</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>gnamak</i>,) which signifies to be deep, is explained by some as meaning to
multiply and the metaphor is supposed to be borrowed from heaps, "As you have
heaped up your sins, so return now." But I prefer the former exposition.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrs</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>sarah</i>) signifies "revolt." Others explain it to mean here "depravity,"
but the word "revolt" is more appropriate. The Prophet therefore invites them to
return to the Lord.

who had revolted from the faith and obedience of their fathers, and therefore
this title contains an indirect reproach. Yet he means that the Lord had not
forgotten the covenant which he made with their fathers, though they had
departed widely from him by their treachery; for he declares, that he will
acknowledge them to be "the children of Israel," and will fulfill all that he
promised to Abraham and the other patriarchs, if they return to him with all
their heart.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For in that
day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He continues the subject which he began in
the former verse. Yet there is this difference, that in the former verse he
exhorted to repentance, but now he points out the fruits of repentance, which,
we know, is the customary way of teaching in Scripture; for, since repentance is
concealed within us, and has its root in the heart, it must be made known by the
practical result, and by works, as "a tree shews by its fruits"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400717&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
7:17) its inherent goodness; and therefore he points out repentance by works
which are the fruit of it.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F578</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall
cast away the idols.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When he speaks of "idols"
only, it is by a figure of speech frequently employed in Scripture, in which a
part is taken for the whole; for the Prophet undoubtedly intended to speak of
the whole of man's conversion, but, as it would have been tedious to enumerate
all the kinds, under one of them he includes all the rest. Now, the beginning of
repentance is the change of the heart; and next we must come to outward fruits,
that is, to works. Above all, we must observe the object which the Prophet had
in view in discoursing about repentance. It was because the Lord had promised
salvation near at hand; and, that they might be capable of it, he exhorts them
to repentance. Hence it ought to be observed that, when we persevere in being
wicked, we resist God by our wickedness, and thus restrain his grace from
assisting us; and, therefore, that the way may be open for God's assistance, he
demands that we shall repent.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He calls them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The idols of his silver and the
idols of his gold</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because, as we have formerly
seen,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F579</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
they who sincerely repent are affected by deep grief for their sin, so that the
traces of their superstitions, which are stamped with the highest dishonor of
God, cannot be beheld by them without the greatest horror. On this account they
abhor them, and do not dread the loss of "gold or silver," to testify their
conversion and their faith; for he who has sincerely renounced superstitions
does not spare any expense in order to possess the pure worship of God. This is
what the Prophet intended to express by calling them "gold and silver" rather
than wood and stone. However excellent anything may be, the loss of it is a
happy event when we are cleansed from such base and abominable pollutions. Those
who retain them, though they profess to be Christians, shew that they are still
involved in the remains of superstition; and hence it is evident that their
hearts are not truly or completely reformed. In this matter we must listen to
none of the excuses which we frequently hear from the lips of hypocrites, who
cannot absolutely renounce idolatry, "What could I do? How could I live? I am
aware that this revenue, this 'gold,' is detestable in the sight of God, because
it arises from idolatry; but in some way or other my life must be supported."
Away with such fooleries! say I; for where the conversion of the heart is real,
that which cannot be retained without insulting or dishonoring God is instantly
thrown away.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which your own
hands have made.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet urges them to make
a more full acknowledgment of their sin; for, when men are accused, they
generally throw the blame on some other person, and do not willingly allow it to
fall on themselves, or acknowledge that it is chargeable upon them; in like
manner as the common people willingly accuse the priests, but no man is willing
to acknowledge his own guilt. The Prophet therefore bids them look to "their own
hands," that they may know that they have committed so great a crime. He reminds
them, at the same time, how grossly they have been deceived by their unbelief in
making gods to themselves; and hence we ought to conclude that God rejects
everything that is of our contrivance, and that he cannot accept as good that
worship which has originated with ourselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino">I
consider

as if he had said, "Whenever you behold idols, behold your guilt; acknowledge
the proofs of your treachery and revolt; and if you are truly converted to God,
shew it practically, that is, by throwing away idols and bidding adieu to
superstitions; for this is the true fruit of
conversion."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>vau</i>) is better translated as an adverb of time: "<i>Then</i> the
Assyrian shall fall down;" that is, "When you shall have turned to the Lord, and
when your life shall testify a sincere repentance, <i>then</i> the enemy shall
fall down;" for, as the Lord raised up the Assyrian to punish the Jews for their
crimes, and especially for idolatry, so he promises that the Assyrians shall be
brought down, when they shall have ceased to sin and worship idols. Hence he
informs us, that our obstinacy is the reason why the Lord adds evil to evil, and
doubles his strokes, and pursues us more and more; for we continually supply
fresh materials to inflame his vengeance against us more and more. If therefore
we wish that God's chastisements should be less severe, if we wish that the
enemies should fall to the ground and perish, let us endeavor to be reconciled
to him by repentance; for he will speedily put an end to the chastisement, and
will take away from enemies strength and power to injure
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By the sword not of a
man.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F581</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The Prophet means that the deliverance of the Church is God's own work, that the
Jews may know that, although no earthly power is visible, God's secret power is
sufficient to deliver them. If therefore enemies are subdued, if their rage is
restrained, let us know that it proceedeth from the Lord. By various methods,
indeed, he represses the force and violence of wicked men, but by his own hand
alone he delivers his Church; for, while the Lord makes use of human means, he
preserves his own people miraculously and by extraordinary methods, which may be
seen to have happened since the beginning of the world, and which we may even
now behold, if we are not blind. And yet this does not hinder the Lord from
employing his servants to deliver the Church; but he employs them in such a
manner that his own hand is peculiarly and illustriously displayed in
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We know that this prediction of Isaiah was
fulfilled when the Assyrian army was destroyed, and Sennacherib was put to
flight; for "not by the arm of man" was he destroyed, but the Lord displayed his
power, that it might be known that he alone is the deliverer of his Church.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121935&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 19:35;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233736&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
37:36.) By delivering Jerusalem at that time from the siege, God thus exhibited,
as in a picture, spiritual redemption. He alone, therefore, will destroy our
spiritual enemies. In vain shall we resort to other aids or remedies, or rely on
our own strength, which is nothing; but let us have the direction and assistance
of God, and we shall come off
victorious.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And his young men
shall melt away.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F582</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He means that the power of the Lord displayed against the Assyrians will be so
great that the hearts of young men, who in other circumstances are wont to be
fierce, shall be altogether softened and melt like wax; for young men, having
less experience than old men, are on that account more fierce and impetuous. God
will easily restrain such fierceness, when he shall determine to deliver his
people from the hands of their enemies. For this reason Isaiah has especially
mentioned "young men;" as if he had said, "the very flower or
strength."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>

He now speaks of Sennacherib himself, who, trembling, shall betake himself in
base and shameful flight to his "stronghold" or fortress, Nineveh, as to his
nest.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121936&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 19:36.) The Prophet adds that "his princes," or military officers, whose
duty it is to encourage the rest of the soldiers, will be so timid that they
shall not venture to join the ranks or await the battle, but shall "flee away
from the standard."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Saith
Jehovah, who hath a fire in Zion.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> At length he
declares that he is God's herald in making this proclamation, that the Jews may
not, as they are accustomed to do, dispute or hesitate as to the accomplishment
of it, or afterwards forget so great a blessing, and ascribe it to fortune. If
we read, as some do, Whose fire is in Zion, the meaning will be, that God has
abundance of fiery power to consume his enemies. But I think that the relative
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>asher</i>) is redundant, or that it should be rendered in the nominative
case, "<i>Who</i> shall be to him a fire;" for God is justly called "a fire," in
reference to the Assyrians, whom he will
consume.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When the Prophet calls him "a fire,"
some consider it to refer to sacrifices; but such an interpretation appears to
me to be feeble and unnatural. I have no doubt that he says either that "the
Lord has a fire" to consume the Assyrian, or that "God himself is a fire," and
that he thus makes an implied comparison of the Assyrian to straw or chaff. He
says that this "fire" is kindled and kept alive "in Zion and Jerusalem," that
is, in the midst of his people, in order to intimate that the persecution of the
Church of God by wicked men shall not pass unpunished; for they shall one day
feel that he is their Judge, and shall know by experience that he assists his
people, who thought that they had been left without all
assistance.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In a word, against wicked men, who
have maintained unceasing hostility against the Church, vengeance is prepared;
and the Lord will not only avenge himself, but will also avenge his people. Let
us therefore enjoy this consolation; and though it may appear as if we were
defenceless and exposed to every danger, yet let us be fully convinced that the
Lord will be "a fire" to our adversaries.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, a King shall
reign.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He means that God will still be gracious
to his Church, so as to restore her entirely; and the best method of restoring
her is, when good government is maintained, and when the whole administration of
it is conducted with propriety, and with good order. This prediction undoubtedly
relates to Hezekiah and his reign, under which the Church was reformed and
restored to its former splendor; for formerly it was in a wretched and ruinous
condition. Ahaz, who was a wicked and disgraceful hypocrite, had corrupted
everything according to his own wicked dispositions, and had overturned the
whole condition of civil government and of religion.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 16:2, 3.) He therefore promises another king, namely, Hezekiah, whose
power and righteousness shall restore the state of affairs which is thus
wretched and desperate. In a word, he presents to us in this passage a lively
picture of the prosperous condition of the Church; and as this cannot be
attained without Christ, this description undoubtedly refers to Christ, of whom
Hezekiah was a type, and whose kingdom he
foreshadowed.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In righteousness
and judgment.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he follows the ordinary
usage of Scripture, which employs those expressions to denote good government;
for by righteousness is meant equity and good government, and by judgment is
meant that part of equity which upholds good men, and defends them from the
assaults of the wicked. It is undoubtedly true that the duty of a good prince
embraces a wider extent than "righteousness and judgment;" for his great aim
ought to be to defend the honor of God and religion. But the ordinary usage of
Scripture is, to describe the whole observation of the law by the works of the
second table; for, if we refrain from acts of injustice, if we aid, as far as
lies in our power, those who are oppressed by others, and, in a word, if we
maintain brotherly kindness, we give evidence of the fear of God, from which
such fruits spring and grow. From a part, therefore, the Prophet has described
the whole.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And princes shall
rule.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is not without good reason that he
likewise mentions nobles;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F584</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for it would not be enough to be a good prince, if he were not supported by
upright ministers and counselors. Frequently has the condition of the people,
under good princes, been very bad; as we read of Nerva,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F585</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
under whose reign every kind of conduct was tolerated, so that many persons were
far less favourably situated under his reign than under Nero; for the
carelessness and indolence of a single individual gave freedom of action to many
wicked men. It is therefore necessary that a king shall have good governors, who
shall supply the place of eyes and hands, and aid him in the righteous exercise
of his authority. If this be not the case, a good king cannot advance a step
without being more or less retarded by other men; and unless rulers move with a
harmony resembling that which we find in musical instruments, the government of
a state cannot be carried on with advantage.</font><br><font face="Palatino">On
this subject, men ought to listen to the advice of Jethro, Moses' father-in-law,
to unite with him</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"able men fearing
God, men of truth, and hating covetousness, and to appoint such men to be rulers
of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021821&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Exodus
18:21.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">But at the present day, those who aid,
or pander to their lusts, and who favor and flatter them, are promoted by kings
to honors and high rank, which are bestowed on them as the just reward of their
flattery or base servility. Nor ought we to wonder if we see, almost throughout
the whole world, states thrown into confusion, ranks overturned, and all good
government despised and set aside; for this is the just punishment of our
iniquities, and we deserve to have such governors, since we do not allow God to
rule over us. How shall this extraordinary kindness of God be enjoyed by men who
are openly rebellious and profane, or by wicked hypocrites who cast God behind
them, and cannot bear the yoke of Christ, through whom this prosperity and
restoration of a declining Church is
promised?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And that man shall

calls that king </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a hiding-place

mankind can never be so happy as when every one voluntarily abstains from every
kind of violence and injustice, and when they conduct themselves peaceably and
without restraint. Since, therefore, most men are urged and driven by their
furious passions to acts of injustice, men would be embroiled in incessant
quarreling if a remedy were not provided in the laws and courts of justice; but
as many rulers, by a tyrannical exercise of power, raise more troubles than they
allay, it is not without good reason that the good king is honored by this
peculiar commendation. If this was said with truth concerning Hezekiah, much
more may it be said concerning Christ, in whom we have our best, or rather, our
only refuge in those storms by which we must be tossed about as long as we dwell
in this world. Whenever, therefore, we are scorched by oppressive heat, let us
learn to retire under his shadow; whenever we are tossed about by tempests, and
think that we are overwhelmed by the violence of the waves, let us learn to
betake ourselves to him as our safest harbour; he will speedily bring every

decayed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b> and <b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then the eyes of them that
see.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Hence we see more clearly that, while the
Prophet describes the reign of Hezekiah, he intends to lead us farther; for here
he discourses concerning the restoration of the Church, which indeed was
shadowed out by Hezekiah, but has been actually fulfilled in Christ. We know
that the Church is never in a healthy condition, unless she be internally ruled
by righteous and wise governors. Now, this cannot be, unless Christ reign; and
here, therefore, Christ and his reign are specially recommended to us. This
promise is contrasted with the dreadful threatening which he had uttered in a
former chapter,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;232910&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
29:10,) that he would blind the Jews; for here, on the other hand, he promises
the true light, that they who were formerly blind may be enlightened, that "the
deaf may begin to hear, that fools may understand, and that stammerers may
speak."</font><br><font face="Palatino">He calls them <i>seeing</i> and
<i>hearing</i> who ought to have seen and heard when the word of God was
exhibited to them; but they chose to be blind and deaf, and turned away their
thoughts and hearts from doctrine. The Lord promises that he will restore to
these persons eyes, ears, a tongue, and understanding. Now, it is certain that
nothing is here promised which does not proceed from the grace of God; for he
does not merely declare what men will do, but what God himself will do in men.
These are extraordinary gifts of God; as, on the contrary, when he blinds, when
he takes away understanding and the right use of speech, when he suffers
ignorance and barbarism to prevail, these are dreadful punishments by which he
takes vengeance on men for their ingratitude and for their contempt of the word.
He promises that, at length, in compassion towards his people, the Lord will
restore what he had justly taken away from them; and it must have been through
the kindness of Christ that a tongue to speak, a mind to understand, and ears to
hear, are restored to us; for formerly we were dull of apprehension, and were
struck with frightful stupidity.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Let us
therefore know that out of Christ there is no spiritual life in the world,
because here they are declared to be destitute of sight, hearing, sound
understanding, and the proper use of speech,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Hence it follows that, when the kingdom of Christ is
overthrown, these blessings are also taken away. It ought also to be observed,
that the blessings which are here recommended are above all others excellent and
desirable; for riches, and possessions, and everything else in which men
commonly judge the happiness of life to consist, ought to be reckoned of no
value in comparison of these blessings. Amidst the abundance of all things we
shall be miserable, unless the Lord restore those spiritual blessings of which
the Prophet speaks in this passage; and therefore, when they are taken away, let
us know that Christ also is at a distance from us, and that we are strangers to
him, seeing that it is from him alone, as Paul informs us, that all spiritual
blessings flow.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490103&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
1:3.) When we see that those blessings which had been taken away for a long
period are now restored to us, let us be ashamed of our ingratitude in not
rendering to Christ that glory which was due to him, and in not employing the
understanding which he gave to us in spreading his kingdom and promoting his
worship; for we plainly shew that he has no dominion over
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the heart of

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F587</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
As fools are commonly hasty and rash, so the Hebrew writers take the word
<i>haste</i>
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F588</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as denoting <i>folly</i>; for wise men are usually
cautious.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>No longer shall the base person
be called.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet means that everything
will be restored to good order, so that vices will not, as formerly, be reckoned
virtues; for, when the public government is wicked, covetous persons are in
power, and are honored and esteemed, because men judge of virtue by wealth and
power; a poor man is everywhere despised, though he be truly upright and
bountiful to the full extent of his ability; and, in a word, in such a state of
things there is nothing but disorder and confusion. But good government quickly
detects such pretences and masks; for, where virtue is esteemed, vices are
immediately exposed. Good men also have greater freedom allowed them in
restraining the wantonness of those who formerly trod under their feet all that
is just and lawful.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When the Prophet speaks here
about the condition and reformation of the Church, which is a spiritual
government, we ought to raise our minds somewhat higher, so as to view all this
as relating to Christ, to whom it specially and peculiarly belongs to expose
hidden vices, and to remove those vails and coverings by which the appearance of
vices is changed, so that they are praised as if they were virtues. He does this
by means of the gospel, by which he drags into light the disgraceful actions
which were formerly concealed, and openly shews what they really are, so that no
man, unless he choose it, can be deceived by their outward appearance. And this
is the reason why the gospel is so much hated by the world; for no man can
patiently endure to have his "hidden thoughts" and concealed baseness
"revealed."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;420235&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
2:35.) Philosophers indeed reason admirably about covetousness and liberality,
and in some degree explain what is the difference between them; but they never
penetrate into the hearts, so as to search them and actually distinguish between
the covetous man and the bountiful. This can only be done by Christ's light,
when he shines by means of the gospel, and, by exploring the deepest corners of
the human heart, brings us to spiritual and inward obedience. In this passage,
therefore, we are brought to the judgment-seat of Christ, who alone, by exposing
hypocrisy, reveals whether we are covetous or
bountiful.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>

a kind of proverbial saying, and render it in the present tense, "The vile
person speaketh vileness." But I think that the Prophet means something higher,
namely, that Christ is the Judge of the world, and therefore, when he shall
ascend the judgment-seat, he will shew what is the disposition of every person;
for, so long as he does not exercise the office of a judge, everything remains
in confusion, the wicked are applauded, because they have the appearance of
piety, and the most excellent men are despised. but Christ will openly display
the life of every person, so that what formerly, under some pretense, bore a
fair reputation, will be manifested to be wickedness; and on this account he is
said to</font><br></div>

he brings malefactors to trial, and draws forth, in spite of their efforts, the
exposure of their transgressions and crimes.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We
have the experience of this more and more every day, when an exposure is made of
that wickedness which had been concealed under the mask of Popery and the
strange folds of superstitions. Who would ever have thought, amidst that
darkness, that there were concealed in the hearts of men such dreadful monsters
as are brought forward at the present day? To such a height has the contempt of
God arisen, that many discover themselves to be more like beasts than men. Yet
the Papists slander us, as if by our doctrine we gave loose reins to men, and
exhorted them to despise God and follow wickedness without fear or shame. But
let them listen to Isaiah, who replies that, when the truth of God shall be made
known, vile persons will speak vileness, and wicked persons will speak baseness
and wickedness; and, indeed, Christ would not be a spiritual judge if he did
not</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To make empty the hungry
soul.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In addition to those mockeries which the
reprobate cast against God, cruelty is next mentioned. The Prophet thus gives an
exact enumeration of those actions which are contrary to the second table.
Wicked men begin with despising God, then rush to outward crimes, and practice
cruelty of every sort against their neighbors. Now, the worst and most flagrant
of all cruelty is, to "snatch food from the hungry soul and drink from the
thirsty;" for mere natural feeling prompts us to mercy and

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F590</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
compassion. When men are so brutalized that they are not affected by the misery
of others, and lay aside every feeling of humanity, they must be worse than the
beasts themselves, who have some sort of pity for the wants of their own
kind.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The instruments of the covetous
man are evil.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We must always keep by the future
tense; for he does not inquire what wicked men are, but declares that they shall
be revealed under the reign of Christ, that they may no longer deceive or impose
upon any one. He speaks of the heavenly light which would arise, as we have
already said, to expose hidden wickedness. Christ therefore shews what covetous
men are, and how destructive are the means which they employ. If it be thought
better that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ylk</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>kele</i>) should be translated "measures," I have no objection; but the word
"instrument" is more appropriate and extensive, for it includes "instruments" of
every description. It means therefore every kind of means, tricks, and cunning
devices, by which "covetous men" put simple persons off their guard, and draw
them into their nets.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To
deceive the simple by lying words.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now
assigns the reason. It is, because they do not cease to contrive some injury.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F591</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It is certain that this is a description of the practices of bad men, who think
of nothing but their own convenience and gain, and are always bent on cheating
and "deceiving." Christ brings to light those persons, and their tricks and
contrivances.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To speak against
the poor in judgment.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F592</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Various circumstances are brought forward, to present in a more striking light
the shamefulness of this wickedness. First, "to deceive the simple," who cannot
take care of themselves, is more shameful and flagrant than to deceive sharpers
and veterans in crime. It is shameful, secondly, to make use of deceitful
blandishments under the pretense of friendship; thirdly, to deceive "the poor,"
whose poverty we ought rather to have relieved; fourthly, to lay snares in the
very court of justice. This is more highly criminal than if a man were attacked
by open violence; for the court of justice ought to be a refuge for the poor,
and what shall become of them, if it be a den of robbers or thieves? If the
roads are beset by robbers, and if snares are laid, there may be some way of
avoiding them; but there is no possibility of guarding against the frauds
committed in courts of justice. These circumstances, therefore, ought to be
carefully remarked.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the liberal shall devise
liberal things.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We have already said that these
statements of the Prophet have a deeper meaning than is commonly supposed; for
he does not speak in the ordinary sense of the words, but treats of the
reformation of the Church. This relates therefore to the regenerate, over whom
Christ reigns; for, although all are called by the voice of the gospel, yet
there are few who suffer themselves to be placed under his yoke. The Lord makes
them truly kind and bountiful, so that they no longer seek their own
convenience, but are ready to give assistance to the poor, and not only do this
once or oftener, but every day advance more and more in kindness and
generosity.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In acting
liberally he shall make progress.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This passage
is commonly explained in a different manner, namely, that the liberal advance
themselves, and become great by doing good; because God rewards them, and
bestows on them greater blessings. This view pleases at first sight; but the
Prophet, on the contrary, shews that the liberal will never cease to perform
acts of generosity, for they will daily make greater progress, and will pursue
the same designs and adhere firmly to their intention, as it is said by the
Psalmist, "He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness
endureth for eve:"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
112:9;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470909&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 9:9.) This is added, because it is easy to counterfeit liberality
for a time; many even think that they are sincerely bountiful because they have
performed an act of beneficence, but quickly cease and change their purpose. But
true liberality is not momentary or of short duration. They who possess that
virtue persevere steadily, and do not exhaust themselves in a sudden and feeble
flame, of which they quickly afterwards
repent.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This is what the Prophet intended to
express by the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;wq</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>kum</i>,) which signifies to "arise" and "grow." There are indeed many
occurrences which retard the progress of our liberality. We find in men strange
ingratitude so that what we give appears to be ill bestowed. Many are too
greedy, and, like horse-leeches, suck the blood of others. But let us remember
this saying, and listen to Paul's exhortation "not to be weary in well-doing;"
for the Lord exhorts us not to momentary liberality, but to that which shall
endure during the whole course of our life.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
6:9.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye women at ease,
arise.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> These words appear not to be connected
with what goes before; for formerly he spoke about restoring the Church, but now
he threatens that the judgment of God is ready to strike a people carelessly
reposing amidst riches and pleasures; and therefore it is probable that here
Isaiah begins a new and distinct subject. Yet there will be no absurdity in
connecting this with the former prediction, for the Prophets commonly observe
this order. After having promised the grace of God to believers, they next
direct their discourse to hypocrites, to declare that the mercy which the Lord
promises to believers will be of no avail to hypocrites, and that
notwithstanding they shall be punished for their
sins.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As to <i>women</i> being chiefly
addressed, the Hebrew commentators, agreeably to the frequent usage of their
language, suppose "cities"
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F593</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to be meant; but I think that the language here is not figurative, and I rather
adhere to the simple meaning of the words. He addresses "women" rather than men,
in order to shew the extent of that calamity; for in ordinary circumstances
women and children are spared, because they are unfit for war, and have no power
to defend themselves. He says that the destruction will be so cruel that none
shall be spared.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He expressly addresses them
also as "women <i>at ease</i>," who are usually more delicate than others, and,
enjoying the advantages of wealth, have some means of providing for their safety
and of rescuing themselves from calamities, even when persons of ordinary rank
are suffering grievous hardships. But to them especially Isaiah makes the
intimation, that they must "arise" and "tremble;" and he contrasts this
trembling with the ease and luxury which they peacefully enjoyed. He bids them
<i>arise</i>, that they may know that this is not the time for repose, and that
the Lord will arouse them from their ease and
indifference.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear my voice,
ye careless daughters.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F594</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In the same manner as before, the word daughters is interpreted by the rabbins
to mean "villages" or "smaller cities;" but I think, as I have already said,
that it ought to be taken in its literal meaning. He shews them whence shall
arise this terror, whence shall arise that violence which shall compel them to
"arise" and "tremble." It is from the judgment of God. But he mentions "a
voice," that they may know that this prophecy shall not fail of its
accomplishment; because he proclaims war against them by the command of God.
"How efficacious this speech shall be, and what power it shall have to arouse
you, one day you shall actually feel." So frequently does he reproach them for
indolence, carelessness, and luxury, not only because it is harder for those who
live at ease to be harshly aroused, but because the corruption and depravity of
human nature make it scarcely possible for the world to enjoy ease and
prosperity without becoming indolent. Next, falling gradually into slothfulness,
it will deceive itself by a false imagination, and drive far away from it all
fear, and, relying on this confidence, will insolently rise up against
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.

year.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F595</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
By these words he declares that the calamity will be of long duration; for it is
no slight consolation in adversity, when the distresses which must otherwise
have been endured by us with grief and sorrow pass quickly away. But when no end
and no mitigation of sorrows, no comfort or hope of deliverance is held out to
us, what can be left but despair? He therefore threatens not only that they
shall endure them for one year, but that afterwards they must look for new
afflictions.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>You shall
tremble.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By this word he indirectly stings
their slothfulness, by declaring that they who grudged to listen to calm
instruction shall be dragged forth with trembling and alarm. As the Jews were
excessively anxious about earthly blessings and perishing food, he addresses
their senses by threatening a scarcity of wine and wheat. If they had been more
thoroughly purified from grovelling desires, he would rather have threatened
what Jeremiah deplores in his Lamentations, that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"the sacrifices and
festivals had ceased, and that the holy assemblies were discontinued."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;250107&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Lamentations
1:7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But, because they were sunk in their pleasures, and
had not made such proficiency as to know the value of spiritual blessings, the
Prophet accommodates himself to their ignorance, and addresses their bellies
rather than their understandings. He speaks of the desolation of the fields,
which would be the necessary consequence of that calamity; for abundance and
plenty commonly give rise to ease and indifference. "The Lord will therefore,"
says he, "deprive you of all food, and shake off your slothfulness, and take
away all ground of confidence." . Accordingly, we are here reminded that we
ought not to sleep in the midst of prosperity, nor imagine that we are safe, as
if we could expect uninterrupted prosperity in the world. But we ought to use
with moderation the gifts of God, if we do not wish to be suddenly aroused, and
to be overwhelmed when we are off our guard, and to feel the heavier distress
because we did not look for a change of our
affairs.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Tremble.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
This repetition is not unnecessary, but states more fully what he formerly said;
for when men are asleep, they are not easily aroused by the voice of the
prophets, and therefore it is needful to cry aloud and reprove them continually.
And thus, by adding one threatening to another, or by repeating the same
threatenings, he shews how great is the stupidity of men, when they have once
been blinded by prosperity; for they can scarcely endure any longer to hear the
warnings which God addresses to them. Men are undoubtedly more in danger from
prosperity than from adversity; for when matters go smoothly with them, they
flatter themselves, and are intoxicated by their success; and therefore it was
necessary to deal more sharply with the Jews, in order to shake off that
slothfulness. This exhortation of the Prophet ought to be explained in the
future tense; as if he had said, "You shall at length tremble, for the rest
which you now enjoy will not be perpetual."</font><br><font face="Palatino">By
bidding them </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>make themselves
bare, and, gird sackcloth on their loins,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he
describes the manner and dress of mourners. Whenever they were visited by deep
adversity, they put on sackcloth, made bare the other parts of their body, and
by dress, and attitude, and every method, manifested their grief. He desires
women to put on sackcloth and other expressions of mourning, instead of the
luxuries and pleasures in which they eagerly
indulged.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Mourning over the
breasts.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This verse is explained in various
ways. Some understand it to mean simply, that there will be so great a scarcity
of provisions, that women will lose their milk, and thus the children will
"mourn over dry breasts;" which we see sometimes happen, when a very great
scarcity of provisions occasions leanness. But the more generally received and
more appropriate interpretation is, to view the word "breasts" as figuratively
denoting fields and vineyards, as the Prophet himself declares; for they are
justly compared to the breasts of mothers, because, by deriving nourishment from
them, we suck the milk or blood of the earth. He therefore means that there will
be a want of food and nourishment, because the Lord will curse the earth, so
that it shall yield no fruits. Thus shall men sigh over that scarcity, as if
over their mother's "breasts," from which they formerly received delicious
nourishment. This appears to me to be a more natural meaning, and to agree best
with the context; for it serves to explain what afterwards follows, about "rich
fields and the fruitful vine."
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F596</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall grow up the brier and
the thorn.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He confirms the former verse, and
explains the cause of barrenness and famine, which is, that the fields, which
formerly used to be fat and fertile, will be uncultivated, desolate, and barren.
This was a frightful change of affairs; for we know that that country yielded
corn and fruits more plentifully than other countries, not so much by nature as
by the blessing of God; for he had said, "I will give you a land flowing with
milk and honey."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;020308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
3:8, 17; 13:5; 33:3.) This was the cause of the abundance and
fertility.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On the land of my
people</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By giving it this name, he meets an
objection which they might otherwise have brought, that there was no reason to
fear that the land which God had chosen would not produce fruits every year;
because, although the kindness of God extends to all mankind, yet he was in a
peculiar manner the Father and supporter of that nation. It was therefore
incredible that this land, which had been set apart for the children of God,
would be covered with "briers and thorns;" and thus the Prophet reproves the
Jews more sharply, because they not only made void the blessing of God by their
wickedness, but drew down his wrath, so as to spoil and deface the beauty of the
land.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Even on all the houses

(<i>batte</i>,) "houses of," is in the construct state. This appears to me
therefore to be an enlargement of what he had now said, and to mean that this
desolation will be, not only in the utmost corners of the land, but "<i>even</i>
in the houses of joy," that is, in the splendid and magnificent houses, which
formerly were the abodes of the most refined luxury. When the Prophet said this,
he was undoubtedly ridiculed by the men of that age; men certainly did not
listen to him amidst those luxuries by which they were blinded. Besides, they
grew insolent on account of the promises of God, and thought that they would
never be in want of anything. Yet all that Isaiah foretold came to pass. From
this example let us learn to be moderate in our use of prosperity, and to depend
on the blessing of God, so as to obey his word with a good
conscience.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the palace shall be
forsaken.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here also he describes more fully the
desolation of the country; for, having mentioned in the former verse magnificent
houses, he now likewise adds palaces and cities, so as to shew that there is
nothing, however splendid and illustrious, that is exempted from that calamity.
We see that men are dazzled by their own splendor, till they lift up their eyes
to heaven; and the consequence is, that they are soothed to sleep in the midst
of their wealth, and dread nothing. He therefore declares that all that was
splendid, magnificent, and lofty, in Judea, cities, palaces, bulwarks,
fortresses, all will be brought to nothing. When he says <i>for ever</i>, he
again gives warning, as he formerly did, that this calamity will not last only
for a single day, but that, as they had been long hardened in their vices, so it
will be of long duration; for, if they had been punished only for a short time,
being obstinate and intractable, they would quickly have relapsed into their
natural disposition.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Till the Spirit be poured out
upon you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Because the Prophet speaks of the
Jews among whom God had determined to plant his Church, it was therefore
necessary to leave to them some hope of salvation, that they might not faint
amidst so great afflictions; for, while the Lord is severe towards wicked men
who falsely shelter themselves under his name, yet in some manner he preserves
his Church. The Prophet therefore adds this promise, that they might know that,
whatever be the severity with which he punishes his people, still he is always
mindful of his covenant; for he never threatens in such a manner as not to leave
some ground for consolation, so as to cheer and comfort the hearts of believers,
even when their affairs are utterly desperate. Besides, in order that they may
fully enjoy the comfort which is offered to them, he raises their eyes to the
very Author of life; and indeed we see that, when a favorable change takes
place, the greater part of men fill themselves to excess with bread and wine,
and, when they are pressed by famine, they neglect God and solicit the
earth.</font><br><font face="Palatino">With good reason, therefore, does Isaiah
say that "the Spirit" will come <i>from on high</i> to refresh and fertilize the
earth; and he alludes, I have no doubt, to that saying of
David,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Send forth thy Spirit,
and they shall be created, and thou wilt renew the face of the earth."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A430&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
104:30.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Holding out this as an evidence that God is
reconciled, he at the same time declares that the restoration of the Church
proceeds solely from the grace of God, who can remove its barrenness as soon as
he has imparted strength from heaven; for he who created all things out of
nothing, as if they had formerly existed, is able to renew it in a
moment.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the wilderness
become a Carmel.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F598</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In explaining this comparison of "the wilderness" to "Carmel," commentators are
sadly at a loss; but, as I remarked on a former passage,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;232917&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
29:17,) where a similar phrase occurred,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F599</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the Prophet merely, in my opinion, points out the happy effect of that
restoration, namely, that the abundance and plenty of all things will prove that
God is actually reconciled to his people. He says that places which formerly
were "wildernesses" shall be like "Carmel," which was a rich and fertile spot,
and on that account receives its name; and that "Carmel" shall be like "a
wilderness," that is, it shall be so fertile, that if we compare what it now is
with what it shall afterwards be, it may seem like "a wilderness." It is an
enlarged representation of that unwonted fertility. "Fields now barren and
uncultivated shall be fertile, and cultivated and fertile fields shall yield
such abundant fruit that their present fertility is poverty and barrenness, in
comparison of the large produce which they shall afterwards yield; just as if we
should compare the fields of Savoy with those of Sicily and Calabria, and
pronounce them to be a "wilderness." In a word, he describes unparalleled
fertility, which believers shall enjoy, when they have been reconciled to God,
in order that they may know his favor by his acts of
kindness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">While Isaiah thus prophesies
concerning the reign of Hezekiah, all this is declared by him to relate to the
kingdom of Christ as its end and accomplishment; and therefore, when we come to
Christ, we must explain all this spiritually, so as to understand that we are
renewed as soon as the Lord has sent down the Spirit from heaven, that we who
were "wildernesses" may become cultivated and fertile fields. Ere the Spirit of
God has breathed into us, we are justly compared to wildernesses or a dry soil;
for we produce nothing but "thorns and briers," and are by nature unfit for
yielding fruits. Accordingly, they who were barren and unfruitful, when they
have been renewed by the Spirit of God, begin to yield plentiful fruits; and
they whose natural dispositions had some appearance of goodness, being renewed
by the same Spirit, will afterwards be so fruitful, that they will appear as if
they had formerly been a "wilderness;" for all that men possess is but a wild
forest, till they have been renewed by Christ. Whenever, therefore, the Church
is afflicted, and when her condition appears to be desperate, let us raise our
eyes to heaven, and depend fully on these
promises.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And judgment shall dwell in the
wilderness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet shews what is the
actual condition of the Church, that is, when justice and judgment prevail; for
men ought not to be like cattle, which seek nothing but plenty of food and
abundance of outward things. And hence it is plain enough that the Jews were not
confined to transitory enjoyments, so as to have their hope fixed exclusively on
earthly blessings, as some fanatics imagine. They were enjoined to attend to
that which was of the greatest importance, that justice and judgment should
prevail; and undoubtedly they knew that true happiness consists in it. It is
therefore our duty to look chiefly to this, that we should not, like hogs in a
sty, judge of the happiness of life by abundance of bread and wine; for this is
the end of all the blessings which the Lord bestows upon us, this is the object
of our deliverance, "that we should serve him," as Zacharias says, "in holiness
and righteousness."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;420174&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
1:74, 75.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Under the terms "justice" and
"judgment," as we have already seen, he includes all that belongs to
uprightness; for although these two words relate strictly to that equity which
ought to be mutually cultivated among us, yet, since it is customary to describe
the observation of the whole law by the duties of the second table, here the
Prophet, by a figure of speech in which a part is taken for the whole, embraces
also piety and the worship of God. The Prophets are accustomed to notice the
chief duties of brotherly kindness, and those which belong to the second table,
because by these, more than by any others, we manifest the real state of our
feelings towards God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he declares that
justice and judgment have their abode in the wilderness, as well as in the
cultivated fields, this shews more clearly that the abundance of blessings
promised a little before was so great that, when men saw it, they would consider
that those fields which they formerly looked upon as very excellent had been
comparatively barren.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the work of righteousness
shall be peace.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> A little before, he censured
severely that peace which made the Jews drowsy and slothful; he now promises a
different kind of repose, which will be a striking proof of the love of God, who
has received them into favor, and will faithfully guard them. We ought therefore
to observe the implied contrast between that brutal repose which the reprobate
think that they obtain by their presumption in committing every kind of
wickedness, and in which they also fall asleep, and that different kind of
repose, on the other hand, which the children of God obtain by a religious and
holy life, and which Isaiah exhorts us to desire, shewing that we ought
fearlessly to believe that a blessed and joyful peace awaits us when we have
been reconciled to God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In this way he
recommends to them to follow uprightness, that they may obtain assured peace;
for, as Peter declares, there is no better way of procuring favor, that no man
may do us injury, than to abstain from all evil-doing.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600313&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 3:13.) But the Prophet leads them higher, to aim at a religious and holy
life by the grace of God; for nothing is more unreasonable than that wicked men
should desire to have peace, while they are continually fighting against God.
That wish is indeed common; for hardly one person in a hundred shall be found
who does not loudly extol peace, while at the same time every man raises up
enemies to himself in the earth, and all in vast crowds disturb heaven and earth
by their crimes. Now, the latter repose, being perpetual, is compared by him to
the former, which is slight and
momentary.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The effect of
righteousness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When peace receives this
designation, let us learn that, as wars proceed from the wrath of God, which we
provoke by our wickedness, so peace springs from his blessing. When, therefore,
we see enemies enraged to battle, and rising furiously against us, let us seek
no other remedy than repentance; for the Lord will easily allay commotions when
we have returned to him. He it is, as the Psalmist says,
who</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"maketh wars to cease to the
ends of the earth, who breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in pieces, and
burneth the chariots in the fire."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;194609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
46:9.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">We have already said that these things do
not relate exclusively to Hezekiah, but must be referred to
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And my people shall
dwell.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As we have said that spiritual
righteousness is that which has its seat in the hearts of men, we must say the
same thing about peace, which is the fruit of it. Accordingly, when <i>quiet
habitations</i> and <i>resting-places</i> are here mentioned, let us remember
the saying of Paul, "justified by faith, we have peace with God."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
5:1.) When Christ says that he "leaves" this peace to the disciples,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431427&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
14:27,) he affirms that "it cannot be given by the world;" and we ought not to
wonder at this, for, as the same Apostle Paul informs us in another passage,
"this peace surpasses all understanding."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;500407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
4:7.) Having obtained this righteousness, we are no longer restless or alarmed
within, as when we feel in the gnawings of conscience the wrath of God. A bad
conscience is always alarmed, and harassed by wretched
uneasiness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Wicked men must therefore be uneasy,
and distressed by a variety of terrors; for where righteousness is banished that
peace cannot be found; and where Christ reigns, there alone do we find true
peace. Assured peace, therefore, is enjoyed by none but believers, who appeal to
the heavenly tribunal, not only by their piety, but by their reliance on the
mercy of God. Hence we infer that Christ does not yet reign where consciences
are uneasy, and tossed by the various waves of doubts, as must be the case with
Papists and all others who are not built on the sacrifice of Christ and the
atonement obtained through him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the
hail.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We have already said that the prophets
are accustomed frequently to describe under figures the reign of Christ; for
they borrow their metaphors from an earthly kingdom, because our ignorance would
make it almost impossible for us to comprehend, in any other way, the
unspeakable treasure of blessings. The meaning is, "The Lord will remove from
his people distresses and annoyances, and will make them fall on others;"
because here we are liable to various storms and tempests, and must endure rain,
hail, showers, winds, and tempests. He says that God, by his wonderful
providence, will prevent all distresses from doing any injury to believers,
because he will drive their violence in another
direction.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By <i>forests</i> he means
unfrequented and desert places, where there are no crowds of men. Hence we learn
that, when we are under the guardianship of Christ, we are protected from
inconveniences and dangers, but that, at the same time, various storms and
tempests are ready to burst on our heads. But the Lord is our deliverer, who
turns away in another direction the evils that are approaching, or rescues us
when we are in danger.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the
city shall be situated to a low place.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F600</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In order to confirm what he had said about peace, he says, that "cities," which
shall be situated on level ground, will be out of danger; for at that time it
was customary to build on high and elevated places, that the access to them
might be more difficult. "Such," says he, "will be God's protection of his
people, that they will not need the ordinary fortifications, because the city
may be safely set down in valleys; and even although it be liable to the attacks
of enemies, it will sustain no inconvenience, for the hand of the Lord will
protect it." We must not therefore seek safety by relying on our defences, lest
we be immediately driven from our nest; but since our heavenly Father deigns to
provide for our safety, let us be satisfied with having him for our protector
and guardian.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F601</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Blessed are
ye.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He shews how great will be the change, when
Christ shall begin to reign; for he had formerly said that so great would be the
desolation, that "thorns and briers" would overspread the holy land, costly
houses would be thrown down, and cities and palaces would be levelled with the
earth. This would happen, when the incessant attacks of enemies should lay that
country desolate. But now he says that they shall be <i>blessed</i>, because God
will give them abundant produce of all fruits. That fertility which might have
been described in simple language, he illustrates by figures, that they shall
"sow in marshes," and shall "send forth their cattle" into the fields without
dread of losing them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By <i>waters</i> some
understand a rich and fertile soil; but the universal particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lk</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>chol</i>,) <i>all</i>, leads me to take a different view; as if he had said,
"Places which were overrun with waters shall be fit for sowing, and there will
be no reason to fear that the water shall spoil our fields." We are accustomed
also to drive away oxen, and asses, and other animals, from fields, and
especially from sown fields, that they may not eat the corn. But here he says
that the corn will grow so thick and plentifully, that it shall be necessary to
send oxen and asses to crop the early blade, as is commonly done when the corn
is luxuriant.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F602</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">He
calls them <i>blessed</i>, in accordance with the usage of the Hebrew language,
because their labor will never be unprofitable. If it be objected that, under
the reign of Christ, such fertility has never been seen, I acknowledge that,
even when God has shewn the highest kindness to his people, still there have
always been visible marks of the curse, which was entailed on mankind by the
fall and revolt of Adam.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010317&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
3:17.) But since Christ has restored to believers the inheritance of the world,
with good reason do the prophets assert that he would renew the earth, so as to
remove its filthiness and restore that beauty which it had lost. They who
complain that it is not yet fulfilled, ought to consider whether or not they
themselves are purified from every stain of sin. And if they are still at a
great distance from spiritual righteousness, let them be satisfied with enjoying
the blessing of God according to the measure of regeneration, the full enjoyment
of which we must not expect to obtain, till, freed from the pollution of the
flesh, we shall bear the perfect image of God.</font><br></div>

countries, as the way of life, so the houses were much more simple than ours at
present. They had not that quantity and variety of furniture, nor those
accommodations of all sorts with which we abound. It was convenient and even
necessary for them, and it made an essential part in the building of a house, to
furnish the inside of the several apartments with sets of spikes, nails, or
large pegs, upon which to dispose of, and hang up, the several moveables and
utensils in common use, and proper to the apartment. These spikes they worked
into the walls at the first erection of them &#8212; the walls being of such
materials that they could not bear their being driven in afterwards; and they
were contrived so as to strengthen the walls, by binding the parts together as
well as to serve for convenience. Sir John Chardin's account of this matter is
this, 'They do not drive with a hammer the nails that are put into the eastern
walls; the walls are too hard, being of brick, or if they are of clay, too
mouldering; but they fix them in the brick-work as they are building. They are
large nails with square heads like dice, well-made, the ends being so bent as to
make them cramp-irons. They commonly place them at the windows and doors, in
order to hang upon them, when they like, veils and curtains.' (Harmer, Obser.
1:p. 191.) And we may add, that they were put in other places too, in order to
hang up other things of various kinds; as it appears from this place of Isaiah,
and from Ezekiel 15:3, who speaks of a pin, or nail, to hang any vessel
thereon." &#8212; <i>Lowth</i>.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

After mentioning the navigation to Tyre as the earliest route of communication

followed by almost all the Latin interpreters, including Vitringa, and appears
to have suggested the rendering, grounded staff, which is given in our common

treat

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dsy</font><font face="Palatino">

for Rosenmuller has justly remarked that

Availing himself, as it would seem, of this suggestion, Professor Alexander very
felicitously renders it "the rod of doom." "The common version, grounded staff,"
says he, "is almost unintelligble. It is now very generally agreed that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hdswm</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>musadah</i>) denotes the divine determination or decree, and that the whole
phrase means the rod appointed by him, or, to put it in a form at once exact and
poetical, the rod of destiny or doom." Diodati's Italian version gives "Ed ogni

Jarchi was probably held, on the ground of the first part of his paraphrase, to
