<div><font face="Palatino">Almost all interpreters agree in supposing, that in
this psalm David in general expresses his wonder and amazement at the goodness
of God, because, in the exercise of his favor and mercy, he bears with the
wicked, who, notwithstanding, basely contemn him. The opinion which I have
formed is somewhat different. I think that the holy prophet, being grievously
troubled and harassed by wicked and ungodly men, first complains of their
depravity, and then seeks refuge in the infinite goodness of God, which extends
not only to all men in general, but in a particular and special manner to his
own children; and this he does in order to console, and, so to speak, take his
breath, in the assurance that he shall at length be delivered since God is
favorable to him. This is evident from the conclusion of the psalm, in which he
arms and fortifies himself against all the assaults of the ungodly, by
reflecting that he is safe under the protection of God.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>To the chief
musician. A Psalm of David, the servant of Jehovah.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Why the appellation, <i>the servant of God, </i>is
ascribed to David only in this place and in the eighteenth psalm, rather than
elsewhere, cannot positively be ascertained, unless that having been victorious
in a conflict, of all others the most difficult, he proved himself to be a
valiant warrior and an invincible champion in the sight of God. We know how rare
and singular a virtue it is, when ungodliness is prevailing without restraint,
and when the shade of its obscurity darkens our spiritual vision, to look up,
notwithstanding, by the eye of faith, to the providence of God, which, by
disposing our minds to patience, may keep us constantly in the fear of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
36:1-4	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b> Ungodliness saith to the

</i></b><i>Ungodliness saith to the wicked in the midst of my
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Commentators are not agreed as to
the interpretation of the first verse. Literally it is, <i>The saying </i>[or
<i>speech</i>]<i> of transgression, </i>or rather,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Transgression saith to the
wicked</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As, however, the letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
lamed, </i>is in Hebrew sometimes used for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;m</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
min, </i>some translate it thus,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ungodliness or transgression
speaketh of the wicked in my heart;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as
if the prophet had said, I clearly perceive from the wickedness which the
ungodly commit, that they are not influenced by the fear of God. But as there is
no need to depart from the proper signification of the words, I rather agree
with others in supposing that the language of the prophet is to this effect: The
malice of the wicked, though seemingly hidden and unknown, speaks aloud in my
heart, and I am a sure witness of what it says or
suggests.</font><br><font face="Palatino">And, first, it is to be observed, that
the prophet speaks not of outward faults, but penetrates even to the very
source; as if he had said, Although the wicked cloak their malice with wily
dissimulation, yet I know it so well that I seem to hear it speaking. It is
indeed true, that as the ungodly and profane rush headlong into every kind of
wickedness, as if they were never to be called to render up an account of it,
the judgment which David here expresses may be formed even from their life; but
his language is much more emphatic when he says, that the servants of God openly
perceive the depravity of such persons hidden within the heart. Now David does
not speak of the wicked generally, but of the abandoned despisers of God. There
are many who indulge in their vices, who, notwithstanding, are not intoxicated
by the wretched infatuation which David here censures. But when a man becomes
hardened in committing sin, ungodliness at length reduces him to such a state of
insensibility, that, despising the judgment of God, he indulges without fear in
the practice of every sin to which his depraved appetite impels him. A reckless
assurance, therefore, in the commission of sin, and especially where it is
associated with a contempt and scorn of every holy admonition, is, as it were,
an enchantment of Satan, which indicates that the condition of such a person is
indeed hopeless. And although true religion has the effect of keeping the hearts
of the godly in the fear of God, and drives wicked thoughts far from their
minds, yet this does not prevent them from perceiving and understanding in their
hearts how the ungodly are agitated with horrible fury when they neither regard
God nor are afraid of his
judgments.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There is no fear of
God before his eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>David shows in
these few words the end of all evil suggestions; and it is this, that the sense
both of good and evil being destroyed or suppressed, men shrink from nothing, as
if there were not seated in heaven a God, the Judge of all. The meaning
therefore is, Ungodliness speaks in my heart to the wicked man, urging him to
the extremity of madness, so that, laying aside all fear of God, he abandons
himself to the practice of sin; that is to say, I know as well what the ungodly
imagine in their hearts, as if God had set me as a witness or judge to unveil
their hypocrisy, under the mask of which they think their detestable malice is
hidden and deeply buried. When the wicked, therefore, are not restrained by the
fear of God from committing sin, this proceeds from that secret discourse with
themselves, to which we have referred, and by which their understanding is so
depraved and blinded, that, like brute beasts, they run to every excess in
rioting. Since the eyes are, as it were, the guides and conductors of man in
this life, and by their influence move the other senses hither and thither, it
is therefore said that men have the fear of God before their eyes when it
regulates their lives, and by presenting itself to them on every side to which
they may turn, serves like a bridle to restrain their appetites and passions.
David, by using here a contrary form of expression, means that the ungodly run
to every excess in licentiousness, without having any regard to God, because the
depravity of their own hearts has completely blinded
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For he flattereth himself
in his own eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here the Psalmist shows
by their fruits or the marks of their character, that there is no fear of God
among the wicked, seeing they take such pleasure in committing deeds of
wickedness, that, although hateful in the sight of all other men, they still
cherish the natural obstinacy of their hearts, and wilfully harden themselves in
their evil course. First, he says that they nourish their vices by
flatteries,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb3</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that they may not be dissatisfied with
themselves in sinning. But when he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>until their iniquity be found to
be hateful</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>by these words he is to be
understood as referring to their determined obstinacy; for the meaning is, that
while they falsely flatter themselves, they proceed to such an extent in their
evil course, that their iniquity becomes hateful to all men. Some translate the
words thus: <i>So that he himself finds his own iniquity to be hateful; </i>and
understand them as meaning, that the wicked persist in rushing headlong into sin
without restraint, until, satiated or glutted with the indulgence of their
depraved desires, they begin to loathe it: for even the most depraved are
sometimes dissatisfied with themselves on account of their sinful conduct. The
first interpretation is, however, the more natural, namely, that the wicked,
though they are hateful to all men on account of their iniquity, which, when
once discovered and made manifest, excites a general feeling of displeasure, are
not affected by any displeasure against themselves, but, on the contrary, rather
applaud themselves, whilst the people despise them, and abhor the wickedness of
their lives. The prophet, therefore, condemns them for their infatuation in
this, that while all others are offended at their disgraceful conduct, they
themselves are not at all affected by it. As far as in them lies, they abolish
all distinction between good and evil, and lull their conscience into a state of
insensibility, lest it should pain them, and urge them to repentance. Certainly
the infatuation here described ought to be the subject of our serious
consideration, the infatuation which is manifested in this, that men who are
given up to a reprobate mind, while they render themselves hateful in the sight
of all other men, are notwithstanding destitute of all sense of their own
sins.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The words of his mouth
are iniquity and deceit.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The two clauses
of this verse may be understood as referring to the same thing, namely, that the
wicked indulging in deceit and vanity, will not receive or admit the light of
understanding. This, I apprehend, is the meaning of David. He reproves the
wicked not merely for circumventing others by their wiles and stratagems, but
especially because they are altogether destitute of uprightness and sincerity.
We have already said that the Psalmist is here speaking not of sinful and wicked
men, in whose hearts there still remains some fear of God, but of the profane
despisers of his name, who have given themselves up entirely to the practice of
sin. He therefore says that they have always in their mouth some frivolous
excuses and vain pretexts, by which they encourage themselves in rejecting and
scoffing at all sound doctrine. He then adds, that they purposely suppress in
themselves all knowledge or understanding of the distinction between good and
evil, because they have no desire to become better than they are. We know that
God has given understanding to men to direct them to do what is good. Now David
says that the wicked shun it, and strive to deprive themselves of it, that they
may not be constrained to repent of their wickedness, and to amend their lives.
We are taught from this passage, that if at any time we turn aside from the path
of rectitude, the only remedy in such a case is to open the eyes of our
understanding, that we may rightly distinguish between good and evil, and that
thus we may be led back from our wandering. When, instead of doing this, a man
refuses instruction, it is an indication that he is in a state of depravity
altogether desperate.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He meditates iniquity
upon his bed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here the sacred writer
shows that the wickedness of the ungodly man is of a secret and very determined
character. It sometimes happens that many, who otherwise are not disposed to
wickedness, err and fall into sin, because occasion presents itself all on a
sudden; but David tells us, that the wicked, even when they are withdrawn from
the sight of men, and in retirement, form schemes of mischief; and thus,
although there is not presented before them any temptation, or the evil example
of others to excite them to it, they, of their own accord, devise mischief, and
urge themselves to it without being impelled by any thing else. Since he
describes the reprobate by this distinguishing mark of character, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they devise mischief upon their
beds</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>true believers should learn from
this to exercise themselves when alone in meditations of a different nature, and
to make their own life the subject of examination, so that they may exclude all
evil thoughts from their minds. The Psalmist next refers to their stubbornness,
declaring </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they set
themselves in a crooked and perverse way</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>that is to say, they purposely and wilfully harden themselves in doing evil.
Finally, he adds the reason of their doing this:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They abhor not
evil</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Wilfully shutting their eyes, they
rush forward in their headlong course till they spontaneously yield themselves
the slaves of wickedness. Let us now shortly state the contrast between the
ungodly and the people of God, contained in the preceding verses. The former
deceive themselves by flattery; the latter exercise over themselves a strict
control, and examine themselves with a rigid scrutiny: the former, throwing
loose the reins, rush headlong into evil; the latter are restrained by the fear
of God: the former cloak or disguise their offenses by sophistry, and turn light
into darkness; the latter willingly acknowledge their guilt, and by a candid
confession are brought to repentance: the former reject all sound judgment; the
latter always desire to vindicate themselves by coming to the open light of day:
the former upon their bed invent various ways of doing evil; the latter are
sedulously on their guard that they may not devise or stir up within themselves
any sinful desire: the former indulge a deep and fixed contempt of God; the
latter willingly cherish a constant displeasure at their
sins.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Jehovah! thy mercy is
unto the heavens.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Commentators think
that David, after having described the great corruption and depravity which
every where prevail in the world, takes occasion from thence to extol in
rapturous praises the wonderful forbearance of God, in not ceasing to manifest
his favor and good-will towards men, even though they are sunk in iniquity and
crime. But, as I have already observed, I am of a somewhat different opinion.
After having spoken of the very great depravity of men, the prophet, afraid lest
he should become infected by it, or be carried away by the example of the
wicked, as by a flood, quits the subject, and recovers himself by reflecting on
a different theme. It usually happens, that in condemning the wicked, the
contagion of their malice insinuates itself into our minds when we are not
conscious of it; and there is scarcely one in a hundred who, after having
complained of the malice of others, keeps himself in true godliness, pure and
unpolluted. The meaning therefore is, Although we may see among men a sad and
frightful confusion, which, like a great gulf, would swallow up the minds of the
godly, David, nevertheless, maintains that the world is full of the goodness and
righteousness of God, and that he governs heaven and earth on the strictest
principles of equity. And certainly, whenever the corruption of the world
affects our minds, and fills us with amazement, we must take care not to limit
our views to the wickedness of men who overturn and confound all things; but in
the midst of this strange confusion, it becomes us to elevate our thoughts in
admiration and wonder, to the contemplation of the secret providence of God.
David here enumerates four cardinal attributes of Deity, which, according to the
figure of speech called <i>synecdoche, </i>include all the others, and by which
he intimates, in short, that although carnal reason may suggest to us that the
world moves at random, and is directed by chance, yet we ought to consider that
the infinite power of God is always associated with perfect righteousness. In
saying that the goodness of God is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unto the
heavens</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>David's meaning is, that in its
greatness it is as high as the heavens. In the same sense he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy truth is even unto the
clouds</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>truth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>in this place may be taken either for the faithfulness which God manifests
in accomplishing his promises, or for the just and well regulated character of
his government, in which his rectitude is seen to be pure and free from all
deception. But there are many other similar passages of Scripture which
constrain me to refer it to the promises of God, in the keeping and fulfilling
of which he is ever faithful.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy righteousness is as
the mountains of God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In this verse
there is a commendation of God's righteousness, which the sacred writer compares
to the high mountains, (this being the manner of the expression &#8212; "the
mountains of God," for we know that the Hebrews were accustomed to distinguish
by the appellation <i>divine, </i>or <i>of God, </i>whatever is excellent,)
because his glory shines forth more clearly there. In the last place, it is
said, that his <i>judgments are like a great and bottomless abyss. </i>By these
words he teaches us, that to whatever side we turn our eyes, and whether we look
upward or downward, all things are disposed and ordered by the just judgment of
God. This passage is usually quoted in a sense quite different, namely, that the
judgments of God far exceed our limited capacity, and are too mysterious for our
being able to comprehend them; and, indeed, in this sense the similitude of an
abyss is not inappropriate. It is, however, obvious from the context, that the
language of the Psalmist is to be understood in a much more extensive sense, and
as meaning, that however great the depth of wickedness which there is among men,
and though it seems like a flood which breaks forth and overflows the whole
earth, yet still greater is the depth of God's providence, by which he
righteously disposes and governs all things. Whenever, therefore, our faith may
be shaken by the confusion and disorder of human affairs, and when we are unable
to explain the reasons of this disorder and confusion, let us remember that the
judgments of God in the government of the world are with the highest propriety
compared to a great depth which fills heaven and earth, that the consideration
of its infinite greatness may ravish our minds with admiration, swallow up all
our cares, and dispel all our sorrows. When it is added in the end of the verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Jehovah! thou preservest man
and beast,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>the meaning is to this
effect, that since God vouchsafes to extend his providential care even to the
irrational creation, much more does he provide for the wants of men. And,
indeed, whenever any doubt may arise in our minds regarding the providence of
God, we should fortify and encourage ourselves by setting before us this
consideration, that God, who provides food for the beasts of the field, and
maintains them in their present state, can never cease to take care of the human
race. The explanation which some have given of the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>beasts,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>interpreting it allegorically of beastly men, I regard as too forced, and
reject it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O God! how precious is
thy loving-kindness!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some explain these
words in this sense: That the mercy of God is precious, and that the children of
men who put their trust in it are precious; but this is a sense too far removed
from the words of the text. Others understand them as meaning, that the mercy of
God is very great to the gods, that is to say, to the angels and the sons of
men; but this is too refined. I am also surprised that the Jewish Rabbins have
wearied and bewildered themselves, without any occasion, in seeking to find out
new and subtile interpretations, since the meaning of the prophet is of itself
perfectly evident; namely, that it is because the mercy of God is great and
clearly manifested, that the children of men put their trust under the shadow of
it. As David has hitherto been speaking in commendation of the goodness of God,
which extends to every creature, the opinion of other commentators, who consider
that David is here discoursing of the peculiar favor which God manifests towards
his children, is in my judgment very correct. The language seems to refer in
general to all the sons of men, but what follows is applicable properly to the
faithful alone. In order to manifest more clearly the greatness of divine grace,
he thus speaks in general terms, telling us, that God condescends to gather
together under his wings the mortal offspring of Adam, as it is said in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;190804&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
8:4,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"What is man, that thou
art mindful of him?</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and the son of
man, that thou visitest him?"</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The substance of the passage is this: The ungodly may
run to every excess in wickedness, but this temptation does not prevent the
people of God from trusting in his goodness, and casting themselves upon his
fatherly care; while the ungodly, whose minds are degraded, and whose hearts are
polluted, never taste the sweetness of his goodness so as to be led by it to the
faith, and thus to enjoy repose under the shadow of his wings. The metaphorical
expression of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>as applied to God, is common enough in
Scripture.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb9</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> By it God teaches us that we are
preserved in safety under his protecting care, even as the hen cherishes her
chickens under her wings; and thus he invites us kindly and affectionately to
return to
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of that
house.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I have no doubt that by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the fatness of God's
house</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>the prophet means the abundance of
good things which is not designed for all men indiscriminately, but is laid up
in store for the children of God who commit themselves wholly to his protection.
Some restrict the expression to spiritual graces; but to me it seems more
likely, that under it are comprehended all the blessings that are necessary to
the happiness and comfort of the present life, as well as those which pertain to
eternal and heavenly blessedness. It ought, however, to be observed, that in the
style of speaking which the prophet here employs, the use of earthly blessings
is connected with the gracious experience of faith, in the exercise of which we
can alone enjoy them rightfully and lawfully to our own welfare. When the
ungodly glut themselves with the abundance of God's benefits, their bodies
indeed grow fat like the flesh of cattle or swine, but their souls are always
empty and famished. It is the faithful alone, as I have said, who are satisfied
with the goodness of God towards them, because it is to them a pledge of his
fatherly love. The expression <i>meat </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>drink</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>denotes a complete and perfect fullness, and the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>river</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb10</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>denotes an overflowing
abundance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For with thee is the
fountain of life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Psalmist here
confirms the doctrine of the preceding verse, the knowledge of which is so
profitable that no words can adequately express it. As the ungodly profane even
the best of God's gifts by their wicked abuse of them, unless we observe the
distinction which I have stated, it were better for us to perish a hundred times
of hunger, than to be fed abundantly by the goodness of God. The ungodly do not
acknowledge that it is in God they live, move, and have their being, but rather
imagine that they are sustained by their own power; and, accordingly, David, on
the contrary, here affirms from the experience of the godly, and as it were in
their name, that the fountain of life is in God. By this he means, that there is
not a drop of life to be found without him, or which flows not from his grace.
The metaphor of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>light,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>in the last clause of the verse, is tacitly most emphatic, denoting that men
are altogether destitute of light, except in so far as the Lord shines upon
them. If this is true of the light; of this life, how shall we be able to behold
the light of the heavenly world, unless the Spirit of God enlighten us? for we
must maintain that the measure of understanding with which men are by nature
endued is such, that</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Prolong thy mercy to them
that know thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David now sets himself
to pray. And, first, he asks in general, that God would continue his mercy to
all the godly, and then he pleads particularly in his own behalf, imploring the
help of God against his enemies. Those who affirm that God is here said to
prolong or extend his mercy because it is exalted above the heavens, indulge in
a style of speaking too puerile. When David spake of it in such terms in a
preceding verse, his intention was not, as I have already said, to represent the
mercy of God as shut up in heaven, but simply to declare that it was diffused
throughout the world; and here what he desires is just this, that God would
continue to manifest, even to the end, his mercy towards his people. With the
mercy of God he connects his righteousness, combining them as cause and effect.
We have already said in another place, that the righteousness of God is
manifested in his undertaking the defense of his own people, vindicating their
innocence, avenging their wrongs, restraining their enemies, and in proving
himself faithful in the preservation of their welfare and happiness against all
who assail them. Now, since all this is done for them freely by God, David, with
good reason, makes mention particularly of his goodness, and places it first in
order, that we may learn to depend entirely upon his favor. We ought also to
observe the epithets by which he describes true believers; first, he says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they know
God;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and, secondly, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they are upright in
heart.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We learn from this that true
godliness springs from the knowledge of God, and again, that the light of faith
must necessarily dispose us to uprightness of heart. At the same time, we ought
always to bear in mind, that we only know God aright when we render to him the
honor to which he is entitled; that is, when we place entire confidence in
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let not the foot of pride
come upon me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As I have observed a
little before, the Psalmist here applies to his own circumstances the prayer
which he had offered. But by including in his prayer in the preceding verse all
the children of God, he designed to show that he asked nothing for himself apart
from others, but only desired that as one of the godly and upright, who have
their eyes directed to God, he might enjoy his favor. He has employed the
expressions, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the foot of
pride,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb12</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and <i>the hand of the wicked,
</i>in the same sense. As the wicked rush boldly to the destruction of good men,
lifting up their feet to tread upon them, and having their hands ready to do
them wrong, David entreats God to restrain their hands and their feet; and thus
he confesses that he is in danger of being exposed to their insolence, abuse,
and violence, unless God come speedily to his
aid.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b><i>12.</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>There the workers of iniquity are
fallen.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here he derives confidence from
his prayer, not doubting that he has already obtained his request. And thus we
see how the certainty of faith directs the saints to prayer. Besides, still
farther to confirm his confidence and hope in God, he shows, as it were, by
pointing to it with the finger, the certain destruction of the wicked, even
though it lay as yet concealed in the future. In this respect, the adverb
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb13</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is not superfluous; for while the
ungodly boast of their good fortune, and the world applaud them, David beholds
by the eye of faith, as if from a watch-tower, their destruction, and speaks of
it with as much confidence as if he had already seen it realised. That we also
may attain a similar assurance, let us remember, that those who would hasten
prematurely the time of God's vengeance upon the wicked, according to the ardor
of their desires, do indeed err, and that we ought to leave it to the providence
of God to fix the period when, in his wisdom, he shall rise up to judgment. When
it is said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They are thrust
down,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>the meaning is, that they are
agitated with doubt, and totter as in a slippery place, so that in the midst of
their prosperity they have no security. Finally, it is added, that they shall
fall into utter destruction, so that it can never be expected that they shall
rise again.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
37</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This psalm, the title of which shows it to have been
composed by David, contains most profitable instruction. Since the faithful, so
long as they pursue their earthly pilgrimage through life, see things strangely
confused in the world, unless they assuaged their grief with the hope of a
better issue, their courage would soon fail them. The more boldly any man
despises God, and runs to every excess in wickedness, so much the more happily
he seems to live. And since prosperity appears to be a token of God's favor
towards the ungodly, what conclusion, it may be said, can be drawn from this,
but either that the world is governed by chance, and that fortune bears the
sovereignty, or else that God makes no difference between the good and the bad?
The Spirit of God accordingly confirms and strengthens us in this psalm against
the assaults of such a temptation. However great the prosperity which the wicked
enjoy for a time, he declares their felicity to be transient and evanescent, and
that, therefore, they are miserable, while the happiness of which they boast is
cursed; whereas the pious and devoted servants of God never cease to be happy,
even in the midst of their greatest calamities, because God takes care of them,
and at length comes to their aid in due season. This, indeed, is paradoxical,
and wholly repugnant to human reason. For as good men often suffer extreme
poverty, and languish long under many troubles, and are loaded with reproaches
and wrongs, while the wicked and profligate triumph, and are regaled with
pleasures, might we not suppose that God cares not for the things that are done
on earth? It is on this account that, as I have already said, the doctrine of
this psalm is so much the more profitable; because, withdrawing our thoughts
from the present aspect of things, it enjoins us to confide in the providence of
God, until he stretch forth his hand to help those who are his servants, and
demand of the ungodly a strict account of their lives, as of thieves and robbers
who have foully abused his bounty and paternal goodness.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>A Psalm of

</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fret not thyself because
of the wicked.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David lays down this as a
general principle, that the prosperity of the wicked, in which they greatly
rejoice, should on no account vex or disquiet the children of God, because it
will soon fade away. On the other hand, although the people of God are afflicted
for a time, yet the issue of their afflictions shall be such, that they have
every reason to be contented with their lot. Now all this depends upon the
providence of God; for unless we are persuaded that the world is governed by him
in righteousness and truth, our minds will soon stagger, and at length entirely
fail us. David then condemns two sinful affections of the mind, which are indeed
closely allied, and the one of which is generated by the other. He first enjoins
the faithful not to fret on account of the wicked; and, secondly, that they
should not indulge an envious spirit towards them. For, in the first place, when
they see the wicked enjoying prosperity, from which it might naturally be
supposed that God regards not the affairs of men, there is a danger lest they
should shake off the fear of God, and apostatise from the faith. Then another
temptation follows, namely, that the influence of the example of the wicked
excites in them a desire to involve themselves in the same wickedness with them.
This is the natural sense. The Hebrew words,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rjttAla</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>al-tithechar, </i>which we have rendered,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fret not
thyself,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>are by some translated, <i>Do
not mingle thyself with.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb16</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>But this interpretation is too
forced, and may be disproved by the context; for in the eighth verse, where
mention is expressly made of <i>wrath </i>and <i>anger, </i>it would surely be
absurd to interpret in another sense the same verb which immediately follows
these two words, and which is there used in the same sense and for the same end
as in this first verse. In the second place, the order which David observes is
very natural; for when the prosperity of the wicked has irritated our minds, we
very soon begin to envy them their happiness and ease. First, then, he exhorts
us to be on our guard, lest a happiness which is only transitory, or rather
imaginary, should vex or disquiet us; and, secondly, lest envy should lead us to
commit sin. The reason by which he enforces this exhortation is added in the
following verse: for if the wicked flourish to-day like the grass of the field,
to-morrow they shall be cut down and wither. We need not wonder that this
similitude is often to be met with in the sacred writings, since it is so very
appropriate; for we see how soon the strength of the grass decays, and that when
cast down by a blast of wind, or parched with the heat of the sun, even without
being cut by the hand of man, it withers
away.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb17</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In like manner, David tells us that the
judgment of God, like a scythe in the hand of man, shall cut down the wicked, so
that they shall suddenly perish.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Put thy trust in Jehovah,
and do good.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The inspired writer now
goes on, in the second place, to say, that every thing in the end shall be well
with the righteous, because they are under the protection of God. But as there
is nothing better or more desirable than to enjoy the fostering and protecting
care of God, he exhorts them to put their trust in him, and at the same time to
follow after goodness and truth. It is not without good reason that he begins
with the doctrine of faith, or trust in God; for there is nothing more difficult
for men than to preserve their minds in a state of peace and tranquillity,
undisturbed by any disquieting fears, whilst they are in this world, which is
subject to so many changes. On the other hand, while they see the wicked
becoming rich by unjust means, extending their influence, and acquiring power by
unrestrained indulgence in sin, it is no less difficult for them steadily to
persevere in a life of piety and virtue. Nor is it sufficient merely to
disregard those things that are commonly sought after with the greatest
eagerness. Some of the philosophers of antiquity were so noble-minded, that they
despised riches unjustly acquired, and abstained from fraud and robbery; nay,
they held up to ridicule the vain pomp and splendor of the wicked, which the
common people look upon with such high admiration. But as they were destitute of
faith, they defrauded God of his honor, and so it happened that they never knew
what it was to be truly happy. Now, as David places faith first in order, to
show that God is the author of all good, and that by his blessing alone
prosperity is to be looked for; so it ought to be observed that he connects this
with a holy life: for the man who places his whole confidence in God, and gives
himself up to be governed by him, will live uprightly and innocently, and will
devote himself to doing
good.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Dwell in the
land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This language is much more
expressive than if he had promised that the righteous should dwell securely in
the land.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb18</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is just as if he had led them to the
place, and put them in possession of it. Moreover, by these words he declares
that they shall long enjoy it. They are, it is true, only strangers or
sojourners in this world, yet the hand of the Lord is stretched forth to protect
them, so that they live in security and peace. This David again confirms by the
following clause, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt be
fed in truth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Assured of the protection
of God, he exhorts them to place entire and unsuspecting confidence in him. It
is surprising to find how interpreters have wrested, and as it were mangled this
clause, by the different meanings they have put upon it. Some take the verb
<i>to feed </i>in an active signification; and others understand the expression
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to feed on
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as denoting to cherish within the
heart the promises of God. Others are of opinion that David exhorts us to feed
our brethren with faith by ministering to them the pure word of God, which is
the spiritual food of the soul. Others render the term for <i>faith </i>in the
sense of <i>sincerity, </i>so that the expression
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to feed on
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>would signify to behave in an
upright and honest manner among men. But the scope and connection of the passage
necessarily require, and it is quite in accordance with the nature of the Hebrew
language, that the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h[r</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>re-eh, </i>should be taken in a passive signification,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be
fed</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>This, too, is the opinion of the
greater part of commentators, who, notwithstanding, afterwards differ in
explaining its meaning. Some of them adopt the interpretation, that we are fed
with faith, when the promises of God suffice us, and we are satisfied with them.
Others give this explanation, <i>Feed thyself with the fruit of faith,
</i>because God will indeed show that we have not believed his word in vain.
Others explain it in this way, <i>Let truth be thy food, </i>and let nothing
give thee greater pleasure than to converse sincerely and frankly with thy
neighbors. There is still another interpretation which, although in some
respects different, is similar to the preceding, namely, Live not upon spoil,
but be content with lawful sustenance; that is to say, with that which is
lawfully acquired.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb19</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is certainly a shameful and
disgraceful thing that so many learned men should have erred in a matter so
plain and obvious.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb20</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Had not every one been led by his own
ambition to seek for something new, the true and natural meaning of the prophet
would have occurred at once, which is this, Dwell in the land, that thou mayest

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnwma</font><font face="Palatino">,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>truth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

</i>but also <i>secure continuance for a long period. </i>And who does not see
that since the possession of the land was given to the righteous, this latter
clause was added by way of exposition?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And delight thyself in
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This delight is set in
opposition to the vain and deceitful allurements of the world, which so
intoxicate the ungodly, that despising the blessing of God, they dream of no
other happiness than what presents itself for the time before their eyes. This
contrast between the vain and fickle joys with which the world is deluded, and
the true repose enjoyed by the godly, ought to be carefully observed; for
whether all things smile upon us, or whether the Lord exercise us with
adversities, we ought always to hold fast this principle, that as the Lord is
the portion of our inheritance, our lot has fallen in pleasant
places,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
16:5, 6. We must therefore constantly recall to our minds this truth, that it
can never be well with us except in so far as God is gracious to us, so that the
joy we derive from his paternal favor towards us may surpass all the pleasures
of the world. To this injunction a promise is added, that, if we are satisfied
in the enjoyment of God alone, he will liberally bestow upon us all that we
shall desire: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will give thee
the desires of thy heart. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This does not imply
that the godly immediately obtain whatever their fancy may suggest to them; nor
would it be for their profit that God should grant them all their vain desires.
The meaning simply is, that if we stay our minds wholly upon God, instead of
allowing our imaginations like others to roam after idle and frivolous fancies,
all other things will be bestowed upon us in due
season.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Roll</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb22</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> thy ways upon
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here David illustrates and
confirms the doctrine contained in the preceding verse. In order that God may
accomplish our desires, it behoves us to cast all our cares upon him in the
exercise of hope and patience. Accordingly, we are taught from this passage how
to preserve our minds in tranquillity amidst anxieties, dangers, and floods of
trouble. There can be no doubt, that by the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ways</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>we are here to understand all <i>affairs </i>or <i>businesses. </i>The man,
therefore, who, leaving the issue of all his affairs to the will of God, and
who, patiently waiting to receive from his hand whatever he may be pleased to
send, whether prosperity or adversity, casts all his cares, and every other
burden which he bears, into his bosom; or, in other words, commits to him all
his affairs, &#8212; such a person
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rolls his ways upon
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Hence, David again inculcates
the duty of hope and confidence in God:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And trust in
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By this he intimates, that we
render to him the honor to which he is entitled only when we intrust to him the
government and direction of our lives; and thus he provides a remedy for a
disease with which almost all men are infected. Whence is it that the children
of God are envious of the wicked, and are often in trouble and perplexity, and
yield to excess of sorrow, and sometimes even murmur and repine, but because, by
involving themselves immoderately in endless cares, and cherishing too eagerly a
desire to provide for themselves irrespective of God, they plunge, as it were,
into an abyss, or at least accumulate to themselves such a vast load of cares,
that they are forced at last to sink under them? Desirous to provide a remedy
for this evil, David warns us, that in presuming to take upon us the government
of our own life, and to provide for all our affairs as if we were able to bear
so great a burden, we are greatly deceived, and that, therefore, our only remedy
is to fix our eyes upon the providence of God, and to draw from it consolation
in all our sorrows. Those who obey this counsel shall escape that horrible
labyrinth in which all men labor in vain; for when God shall once have taken the
management of our affairs into his own hand, there is no reason to fear that
prosperity shall ever fail us. Whence is it that he forsakes us and disappoints
our expectations, if it is not because we provoke him, by pretending to greater
wisdom and understanding than we possess? If, therefore, we would only permit
him, he will perform his part, and will not disappoint our expectations, which
he sometimes does as a just punishment for our
unbelief.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he will bring forth
thy righteousness as the light</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This
David says, in order to anticipate the misgivings which often trouble us when we
seem to lose our labor in faithfully serving God, and in dealing uprightly with
our neighbors; nay, when our integrity is either exposed to the calumnies of the
wicked, or is the occasion of injury to us from men; for then it is thought to
be of no account in the sight of God. David, therefore, declares, that God will
not suffer our righteousness to be always hid in darkness, but that he will
maintain it and bring it forth to the light; namely, when he will bestow upon us
such a reward as we desire. He alludes to the darkness of the night, which is
soon dispelled by the dawning of the day; as if he had said, We may be often
grievously oppressed, and God may not seem to approve our innocence, yet this
vicissitude should no more disturb our minds than the darkness of the night
which covers the earth; for then the expectation of the light of day sustains
our hope.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

illustration of the same doctrine, namely, that we should patiently and meekly

of disquietude and conflict there is need of no small patience. By the
similitude of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>silence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>which often occurs in the sacred writings, he declares most aptly the nature
of faith; for as our affections rise in rebellion against the will of God, so
faith, restoring us to a state of humble and peaceful submission, appeases all
the tumults of our hearts. By this
expression,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb25</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> therefore, David commands us not to
yield to the tumultuous passions of the soul, as the unbelieving do, nor
fretfully to set ourselves in opposition to the authority of God, but rather to
submit peacefully to him, that he may execute his work in silence. Moreover, as
the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lwj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chul, </i>which we have rendered <i>to wait, </i>sometimes signifies to
<i>mourn, </i>and sometimes to <i>wait, </i>the word

moderately, </i>or <i>to bear sorrow patiently. </i>It might also be rendered
more simply <i>to mourn before God, </i>in order that he might be a witness of
all our sorrows; for when the unbelieving give way to doubt and suspense, they
rather murmur against him than utter their complaints before him. As, however,
the other interpretation is more generally received, namely, that David is
exhorting us to hope and patience, I adhere to it. The prophet Isaiah also
connects hope with silence in the same sense,

is of the same import as to effect what he has purposed. Now we see that these
two things are connected, namely
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to dispose his ways according to
his desires</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to prosper in his way, </i>and
<i>to accomplish his devices</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is a
very great temptation to us and difficult to bear, when we see fortune smiling
upon the ungodly, as if God approved of their wickedness; nay, it excites our
wrath and indignation. David, therefore, not contented with a short admonition,
insists at some length upon this point.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The
accumulation of terms which occurs in the next verse, in which he lays a
restraint as with a bridle upon anger, allays wrath and assuages passion, it is
not superfluous; but, as in necessary, he rather prescribes numerous remedies
for a disease which it is difficult to cure. By this means, he reminds us how
easily we are provoked, and how ready we are to take offence, unless we lay a
powerful restraint upon our tumultuous passions, and keep them under control.
And although the faithful are not able to subdue the lusts of the flesh without
much trouble and labour, whilst the prosperity of the wicked excites their
impatience, yet this repetition teaches us that we ought unceasingly to wrestle
against them; for if we steadily persevere, we know that our endeavors shall not
be in vain in the end. I differ from other commentators in the exposition of the
last clause. They translate it, <i>at least to do evil; </i>as if David meant
that we should appease our anger lest it should lead us to do mischief. But as
the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#176;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ach, </i>which they translate <i>at least, </i>is often used affirmatively in
Hebrew, I have no doubt that David here teaches, that it cannot be otherwise
than that the offense which we take at the prosperity of the wicked should lead
us to sin, unless we speedily check it; as it is said in another
Psalm,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the wicked shall be
cut off.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is not without cause that he
repeatedly inculcates the same thing, namely, that the happiness and prosperity
which the ungodly enjoy is only a mask or phantom; for the first sight of it so
dazzles our senses, that we are unable to form a proper estimate of what will be
its issue, in the light of which alone we ought to judge of the value of all
that has preceded. But the contrast between the two clauses of the verse ought
to be observed. First, in saying that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the wicked shall be cut
off,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he intimates that they shall
flourish fresh and green till the time of their destruction shall arrive; and,
secondly, in allotting the earth to the godly, saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall inherit the
earth,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he means that they shall live in
such a manner as that the blessing of God shall follow them, even to the grave.
Now, as I have already said, the present condition of men is to be estimated by
the state in which it will terminate. From the epithet by which he distinguishes
the children of God, we learn that they are exercised by a severe conflict for
the trial of their faith; for he speaks of them, not as <i>righteous </i>or
<i>godly, </i>but as those that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wait upon the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>What purpose would this waiting
serve, unless they groaned under the burden of the cross? Moreover, the
possession of the earth which he promises to the children of God is not always
realised to them; because it is the will of the Lord that they should live as
strangers and pilgrims in it; neither does he permit them to have any fixed
abode in it, but rather tries them with frequent troubles, that they may desire
with greater alacrity the everlasting dwelling-place of heaven. The flesh is
always seeking to build its nest for ever here; and were we not tossed hither
and thither, and not suffered to rest, we would by and by forget heaven and the
everlasting inheritance. Yet, in the midst of this disquietude, the possession
of the earth, of which David here speaks, is not taken away from the children of
God; for they know most certainly that they are the rightful heirs of the world.
Hence it is that they eat their bread with a quiet conscience, and although they
suffer want, yet God provides for their necessities in due season. Finally,
although the ungodly labor to effect their destruction, and reckon them unworthy
to live upon the earth, yet God stretches forth his hand and protects them; nay,
he so upholds them by his power, that they live more securely in a state of
exile, than the wicked do in their nests to which they are attached. And thus
the blessing, of which David speaks, is in part secret and hidden, because our
reason is so dull, that we cannot comprehend what it is to possess the earth;
and yet the faithful truly feel and understand that this promise is not made to
them in vain, since, having fixed the anchor of their faith in God, they pass
their life every day in peace, while God makes it manifest in their experience,
that the shadow of his hand is sufficient to protect
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10<i>.</i>
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yet a little while, and the
wicked shall not be.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is a
confirmation of the preceding verse. It might well have been objected, that the
actual state of things in the world is very different from what David here
represents it, since the ungodly riot in their pleasures, and the people of God
pine away in sickness and poverty. David, therefore, wishing to guard us against
a rash and hasty judgment, exhorts us to be quiet for a little while, till the
Lord cut off the wicked entirely, and show the efficacy of his grace towards his
own people. What he requires then on the part of the true believers is, that in
the exercise of their wisdom they should suspend their judgment for a time, and
not stop at every trifle, but exercise their thoughts in meditation upon divine
providence, until God show out of heaven that the full time is come. Instead,
however, of describing them as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>those who wait upon the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he now speaks of them as <i>the
meek; </i>and this he does not without good reason: for unless a man believe
that God preserves his own people in a wonderful manner, as if they were like
sheep among wolves, he will be always endeavoring to repel force by
force.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb26</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is hope alone, therefore, which of
itself produces meekness; for, by restraining the impetuosity of the flesh, and
allaying its vehemence, it trains to equanimity and patience those who submit
themselves to God. From this passage it would seem, that Christ has taken that
which is written in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400505&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
5:5. The word <i>peace </i>is generally employed in the Hebrew to denote the
prosperous and happy issue of things; yet another sense will agree better with
this place, namely, that while the ungodly shall be agitated with inward
trouble, and God shall encompass them on every side with terror, the faithful
shall rejoice in the abundance of peace. It is not meant that they are exempted
from trouble, but they are sustained by the tranquillity of their minds; so that
accounting all the trials which they endure to be only temporary, they now
rejoice in hope of the promised
rest.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The wicked plotteth
against the righteous.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David here
anticipates an objection which might have been taken to the preceding verse.
Where, it might be said, can tranquillity and joy be found when the wicked are
mad with rage, and plot every kind of mischief against the children of God? And
how shall they cherish good hope for the future who see themselves surrounded
with innumerable sources of death? David therefore replies, That although the
life of the godly should be assailed by many dangers, yet they are secure in the
aid and protection of God; and that however much the wicked should plot against
them, they shall be continually preserved. Thus, the design of David is to
obviate our fears, lest the malice of the ungodly should terrify us above
measure, as if they had the power of doing with us according to their
pleasure.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb28</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He indeed confesses that they are not
only full of fraud, and expert in deceiving, but also that they burn with anger,
and a raging desire of doing mischief, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they plot mischief
deceitfully against the righteous, and gnash upon them with their
teeth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But after making this statement,
he immediately adds, that their endeavors shall be vain. Yet he seems to provide
very coldly for our consolation under sorrow, for he represents God as merely
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>laughing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>But if God values highly our salvation, why does he not set himself to
resist the fury of our enemies, and vigorously oppose them? We know that this,
as has been said in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;190204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
2:4, is a proper trial of our patience, when God does not come forth at once,
armed for the discomfiture of the ungodly, but connives for a time and withholds
his hand. But as the eye of sense in such circumstances reckons that he delays
his coming too long, and from that delay concludes that he indulges in ease, and
feels no interest in the affairs of men, it is no small consolation to be able
by the eye of faith to behold him laughing; for then we are assured that he is
not seated idly in heaven, nor closes his eyes, resigning to chance the
government of the world, but purposely delays and keeps silence because he
despises their vanity and folly.</font><br><font face="Palatino">And lest the
flesh should still murmur and complain, demanding why God should only laugh at
the wicked, and not rather take vengeance upon them, the reason is added, that
he sees the day of their destruction at hand:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For he seeth that his
day</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb29</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> is
coming.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Whence is it that the injuries
we sustain from the wickedness of man so trouble us, if it be not that, when not
obtaining a speedy redress, we begin to despair of ever seeing a better state of
things? But he who sees the executioner standing behind the aggressor with drawn
sword no longer desires revenge, but rather exults in the prospect of speedy
retribution. David, therefore, teaches us that it is not meet that God, who sees
the destruction of the wicked to be at hand, should rage and fret after the
manner of men. There is then a tacit distinction here made between God and men,
who, amidst the troubles and confusions of the world, do not see the day of the
wicked coming, and who, oppressed by cares and fears, cannot laugh, but because
vengeance is delayed, rather become so impatient that they murmur and fret. It
is not, however, enough for us to know that God acts in a manner altogether
different from us, unless we learn to weep patiently whilst he laughs, so that
our tears may be a sacrifice of obedience. In the meantime, let us pray that he
would enlighten us by his light, for by this means alone will we, by beholding
with the eye of faith his laughter, become partakers thereof, even in the midst
of sorrow. Some, indeed, explain these two verses in another sense; as if David
meant to say, that the faithful live so happily that the wicked envy them. But
the reader will now perceive that this is far from the design of the
prophet.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The wicked draw their sword,
and bend their bow.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David now goes on to
say, that the ungodly, being armed with sword and bow, threaten with death the
children of God; and this he does in order to meet the temptation which would
otherwise overwhelm them. The promises of God do not have place in a time of
quietness and peace, but in the midst of severe and terrible conflicts. And,
therefore, David now teaches us that the righteous are not deprived of that
peace of which he had spoken a little before, although the wicked should
threaten them with instant death. The sentence ought to be explained in this
way: Although the wicked draw their swords and bend their bows to destroy the
righteous, yet all their efforts shall return upon their own heads, and shall
tend to their own destruction. But it is necessary to notice the particular
terms in which the miserable condition of the righteous is here described, until
God at length vouchsafe to help them. First,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they are called poor and
needy;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and, secondly, they are compared
to sheep devoted to destruction,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb30</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> because they have no power to withstand
the violence of their enemies, but rather lie oppressed under their feet. Whence
it follows, that a uniform state of enjoyment here is not promised to them in
this psalm, but there is only set before them the hope of a blessed issue to
their miseries and afflictions, in order to console them under them. But as it
often happens that the wicked are hated and treated with severity for their
iniquity, the Psalmist adds, that those who thus suffered were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>those who were of upright
ways;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>meaning by this, that they were
afflicted without cause. Formerly he described them as <i>the upright in
heart</i>, by which he commended the inward purity of the heart; but now he
commends uprightness in the conduct, and in fulfilling every duty towards our
neighbor; and thus he shows not only that they are unjustly persecuted, because
they have done no evil to their enemies, and have given them no cause of
offense, but also, that though provoked by injuries, they nevertheless do not
turn aside from the path of duty.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the 15th
verse, David is not speaking of the laughter of God, but is denouncing vengeance
against the ungodly, just as we have already seen in the second psalm, at the
fourth verse, that although God, by conniving at the wicked, has often suffered
them for a time to run to every excess in mirth and rioting, yet he at length
speaks to them in his anger to overthrow them. The amount of what is stated is,
that the ungodly should prevail so little, that the sword which they had drawn
should return into their own bowels, and that their bow should be broken in
pieces.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i>indeed, sometimes signifies a great multitude of men, and sometimes
abundance of things; sometimes, too, an adjective of the plural number is joined
to a substantive of the singular number. But those who wrest David's words to
this sense, that a few righteous persons are better than a great multitude of
the ungodly,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb33</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> plainly destroy their import, and
pervert the meaning of the whole sentence. Nor can I receive the explanation
which others have given, that the little which the just man possesses is better
than the great abundance of the wicked; for I see no necessity for connecting,
contrary to the rules of grammar, the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wmh</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
hamon, </i>which denotes
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>abundance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ybr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rabbim. </i>which signifies
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>many</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;y[&ccedil;r</font><font face="OLBwds">,</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>reshaim, </i>which means
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wicked</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>I have therefore no doubt; that David here contrasts the limited possessions
of one righteous man with the riches and wealth of many wicked men. The Hebrew
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ybr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rabbim, </i>however, which I have rendered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>many</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>may also be properly taken to denote persons of great authority and power.
Certainly, it is not difficult to understand that David means to say, that
although the wicked excel in this world, and are enriched with its possessions
in great abundance and trust in their riches, yet the little which the just man
possesses is far better than all their treasures. From this we learn, that David
is here speaking, not so much of external grandeur and wealth, as of the secret
blessing of God which truly enriches the righteous; for although they live from
hand to mouth, yet are they fed from heaven as it were with manna; while the
ungodly are always hungry, or else waste away in the very midst of their
abundance.</font><br><font face="Palatino">To this also belongs the reason which
is added in the next verse, namely, that there is nothing stable in the world
except it be sustained by the power of God; but we are plainly told that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
righteous</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>only are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>upheld by
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the power of the ungodly shall be
broken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here again we see, that in order
to form a right and proper estimate of true felicity, we must look forward to
the future, or contemplate by the eye of faith the secret grace of God, and his
hidden judgments. Unless we are persuaded by faith that God cherishes us in his
bosom as a father does his children, our poverty will always be a source of
trouble to us; and, on the other hand, unless we bear in mind what is here said
concerning the wicked, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their
arms shall be broken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>we will make too
great account of their present condition. But if this doctrine be deeply fixed
in the hearts of the faithful, as soon as they shall have learned to rely upon
the divine blessing, the delight and joy which they will experience from their
little store shall be equal to the magnanimity with which they shall look down,
as it were from an eminence, upon the vast treasures in which the ungodly glory.
At the same time, we are here admonished, that whilst the ungodly rely upon
their own strength, and proudly boast of it, we ought to wait patiently till God
arise and break their arms in pieces. As for us, the best consolation which we
could have in our infirmity is, that God himself upholds and strengthens
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18<i>.</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>Jehovah knoweth the days of the
upright</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb34</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is not without good reason
that David so frequently inculcates this doctrine, that the righteous are
blessed because God provides for their necessities. We see how prone the minds
of men are to distrust, and how much they are vexed by an excess of cares and
anxieties from which they are unable to extricate themselves, while, on the
other hand, they fall into another error in being more anxious regarding the
future than there is any reason for; and yet, however active and industrious in
the formation of their plans, they are often disappointed in their expectations,
and not unfrequently fail altogether of success. Nothing, therefore, is more
profitable for us than to have our eyes continually set upon the providence of
God, which alone can best provide for us every thing we need. On this account,
David now says, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God knoweth
the days of the righteous</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is to
say, he is not ignorant of the dangers to which they are exposed, and the help
which they need. This doctrine we ought to improve as a source of consolation
under every vicissitude which may seem to threaten us with destruction. We may
be harassed in various ways, and distracted by many dangers, which every moment
threaten us with death, but this consideration ought to prove to us a sufficient
ground of comfort, that not only are our days numbered by God, but that he also
knows all the vicissitudes of our lot on earth. Since God then so carefully
watches over us for the maintenance of our welfare, we ought to enjoy, in this
our pilgrimage on earth, as much peace and satisfaction as if we were put in
full possession of our paternal inheritance and home. Because we are regarded by
God, David from this concludes, that our inheritance is everlasting. Moreover,
in declaring that those who are upright are thus carefully protected by God, he
exhorts us to the sincere pursuit of truth and uprightness; and if we desire to
be placed in safety under the protection of God, let us cultivate meekness, and
reject with detestation this hellish proverb, "We must howl among
wolves."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19<i>.</i>
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall not be ashamed in
the season of adversity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This verse also
shows us, that the faithful have no right to expect such exemption as the flesh
would desire from affliction and trial, but they are assured of deliverance in
the end; which, though it be indeed obtained, yet it is of such a nature as can
be realised only by faith. We must regard these two things as inseparably
connected, namely, that as the faithful are mingled among the wicked in this
world, so hunger and adversity are common to both. The only difference betwixt
them is, that God stretches forth his hand towards his own people in the time of
their need, while he abandons the ungodly, and takes no care of them. If it
should be objected, that the wicked often fare sumptuously in the time of
famine, and gratify all their desires, whilst the faithful are oppressed with
poverty and want, I answer, that the fullness of which mention is here made
consists chiefly in this, that the faithful, though they live sparingly, and
often labor hard to acquire the means of subsistence, are nevertheless fed by
God as truly as if they had a greater abundance of this world's goods than the
ungodly, who greedily devour the good things of this life in all their variety
and abundance, and yet are never satisfied. Besides, as I have elsewhere said,
these temporal blessings are not always seen flowing in one uniform course. The
hand of God is indeed always open, but we are straitened and limited in our
desires, so that our own unbelief is no small hinderance to his liberality.
Moreover, as our corrupt nature would soon break forth into excess, God deals
with us more sparingly; and lest he might corrupt us by too great indulgence, he
trains us to frugality by bestowing with a sparing hand what he was ready
otherwise to lavish upon us in full abundance. And, indeed, whoever shall
consider how much addicted we are to sensuality and pleasure, will not be
surprised that God should exercise his own people with poverty and want. But
although God may not bestow upon us what is necessary for our gratification,
yet, unless our own ingratitude prevent us, we shall experience, even in famine
and want, that be nourishes us graciously and
liberally.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

a contrast between the subjects spoken of, namely, that the righteous are
satisfied in the time of famine, whereas the ungodly shall perish in the midst
of their affluence; for, while they trust in their abundance, God brings them to
nought by the use of means that are secret and hidden. In calling them the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>enemies of

justly overwhelmed by his vengeance, which they bring upon themselves by their
own wickedness. When he says, that they

learn from this what another prophet likewise teaches, that the ungodly are
fattened for the day of slaughter; so that the more sumptuously they shall have

suppose that the wicked are here blamed for their treachery in carrying off the
goods of others by fraud and deception; and that, on the other hand, the
children of God are commended for their kindness in being always ready to
relieve the wants of their poorer brethren. The prophet rather extols, on the
one hand, the blessing of God towards the godly; and declares, on the other,
that the ungodly never have enough. The meaning therefore is, that God deals
bountifully with his own people, that they may be able to aid others; but that
the ungodly are always in want, so that their poverty leads them to have
recourse to fraud and rapine. And were we not blinded by insensibility and
indifference, we could not fail to perceive the many proofs of this which are
daily presented to our view. However great the abundance of the ungodly, yet
their covetousness is so insatiable, that, like robbers, they plunder right and

for wasteful extravagance, by which they defraud their creditors of what is
their due, and also that the righteous are praised for applying to a proper use
the bounty of God; but the design of the prophet is to show the high value of
the divine blessing. This is confirmed by the following verse, in which he
illustrates the difference resulting from the blessing and the curse of God. It
then it is asked, whence the children of God are able to relieve the wants of
the needy, and to exercise liberality towards them? and why it is that the
ungodly are continually contracting debts from which they are never able to
extricate themselves? David answers, that the former are blessed of the Lord,
and that the latter are brought to utter ruin by his curse. Some expound the
word

meaning is simply this, that whatever we need for the preservation and

us neither from the heavens nor from the earth, but only from the favor and

us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

these two things, first, that the footsteps of the godly are ordered by the
grace of God, since men do not in their own strength follow what is just and
right, but only in so far as the Spirit of God directs them; and hence the
second follows, namely, that God favors and approves what is his own. But David
simply continues his commendation of the divine blessing towards the faithful,
of whom this is especially worthy of being remembered, that whatever they
undertake always has a favorable and happy result. At the same time, the reason
why God crowns with prosperity and success all our efforts throughout the course
of our life is to be observed, namely, because we attempt nothing which is not
pleasing to him. For I consider the copula <i>and, </i>in the second clause of
the verse, to be used instead of the causal particle <i>because, </i>and resolve
the whole verse in this way: Because the way of the godly is acceptable to God,
he directs their footsteps to a happy issue; so that the meaning is, As God sees
that the faithful act conscientiously, and do not turn aside from the way which
he has appointed, he blesses their efforts. And, certainly, since the prophet
speaks generally &#8212; and yet it is certain that the faithful only are here
spoken of &#8212; the second clause must necessarily be considered as spoken by
way of exposition. Accordingly, the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>way</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

have no other object in view but to frame their lives agreeably to the will of
God, and to obey what he commands. The term

generally been interpreted proverbially, and as meaning, that though the
righteous may fall into sin, his fall is not deadly; but this is not at all in
accordance with the design of the prophet, who is discoursing of the happiness
of the godly. The simple meaning is, that when God visits his servants with
severe afflictions, he at the same time mitigates them that they may not faint
under them;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino">Some say that the righteous are not utterly cast

fortitude whatever burden is laid upon them. I readily admit that the reason why
they are not overwhelmed is, that they are not so tender and delicate as to sink
under the burden. I, however, understand the words in a more extensive sense,
and explain them thus: That the miseries of the godly are so tempered with God's
fatherly mercy, that they fail not under their burden, and even when they fall,
sink not into destruction. From these words we learn that the godly, although
they serve God sincerely, and study to lead a blameless life, are not suffered
to continue unmoved, and always in the same condition, but are often afflicted
and cast down by various trials; and that the only difference between them and
the unbelieving is, that their falls are not deadly. We know that if God smite
the reprobate, though it be but very slightly, it becomes the cause of their
final destruction. Solomon speaks still more expressly when he
says,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">and by these words he teaches us, that the godly are
not only subjected to frequent afflictions in this life, but that they are
visited with daily trials, and yet are never forsaken of the Lord. We must also
shortly observe, that even the slightest fall would be enough to destroy us
utterly, did not God uphold us by his
hand.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25<i>.</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>I have been young, I am also become
old.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The meaning of these words is not
in the least doubtful, namely, that David, even when he was become an old man,
had not seen any of the righteous, or any of their children, begging their
bread. But here there arises a question of some difficulty with respect to the
fact stated; for it is certain that many righteous men have been reduced to
beggary. And what David here declares as the result of his own experience
pertains to all ages. Besides, he refers in this verse to the writings of Moses,
for in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051504&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
15:4, begging is reckoned among the curses of God; and the law, in that place,
expressly exempts from it those who fear and serve God. How then does the
consistency of this appear, that none of the righteous ever begged his bread,
since Christ placed Lazarus among the most abject of them?
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;421620&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
16:20.) I answer, that we must bear in mind what I have before said upon this
subject, that with respect to the temporal blessings which God confers upon his
people, no certain or uniform rule can be established. There are various reasons
why God does not manifest his favor equally to all the godly in this world. He
chastises some, while he spares others: he heals the secret maladies of some,
and passes by others, because they have no need of a like remedy: he exercises
the patience of some, according as he has given them the spirit of fortitude;
and, finally, he sets forth others by way of example. But in general, he humbles
all of them by the tokens of his anger, that by secret warnings they may be
brought to repentance. Besides, he leads them, by a variety of afflictions, to
fix their thoughts in meditation upon the heavenly life; and yet it is not a
vain or imaginary thing, that, as is set forth in the Law, God vouchsafes
earthly blessings to his servants as proofs of his favor toward them. I confess,
I say, that it is not in vain, or for nought, that an abundance of earthly
blessings, sufficient for the supply of all their wants, is promised to the
godly. This, however, is always to be understood with this limitation, that God
will bestow these blessings only in so far as he shall consider it expedient:
and, accordingly, it may happen that the blessing of God may be manifested in
the life of men in general, and yet some of the godly be pinched with poverty,
because it is for their good. But if it happen that any of the faithful are
brought to beggary, they should lift up their minds on high, to that blessed
state in which God will largely recompense them for all that is now wanting in
the blessings of this transitory life. We must also bear this in mind, that if
God sometimes involve the faithful in the same punishments by which he takes
vengeance upon the ungodly &#8212; seeing them, for example, affected with the
same diseases, &#8212; in doing so there is no inconsistency; for although they
do not come the length of contemning God, nor are devoted to wickedness, nor
even act according to their own inclination, nor yield themselves wholly to the
influence of sin like the wicked, yet are they not free of all blame; and,
therefore, it need not surprise us though they are sometimes subjected to
temporal punishments. We are, however, certain of this, that God makes such
provision for his own people, that, being contented with their lot, they are
never in want; because, by living sparingly, they always have enough, as Paul
says, Philippians 6:12,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"I am instructed both to
abound and to suffer need."</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>26<i>.</i>
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He is daily
merciful</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Psalmist here repeats what
he had already said, that the grace of God is a fountain of all blessings which
can never be exhausted; and, therefore, while it is displayed towards the
faithful, they not only have enough for the supply of their own wants, but are
able also liberally to assist others. What he adds concerning <i>their seed
</i>is variously expounded. That he is speaking of the children of the godly,
there can be no doubt; and this is evident from the preceding verse. But when he
says that they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be for
blessing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb41</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> some understand it as if he had said,
They shall be the ministers of God's liberality: so that, according to them, the
sense would be, that they shall follow the good example of their fathers in
helping the poor, and in exercising liberality towards all men. But I fear that
this exposition is too refined. Nor do I admit the interpretation which has been
given by others, that the meaning is, that the grace of God shall be so signally
manifested towards the children of the godly, that their names shall be employed
in a form of prayer, when prosperity and success are prayed for. This mode of
expression, I allow, is to be so understood in various places; but here, in my
opinion, David designs nothing more than to extol the continuation of God's
favor from the fathers to their children: as if he had said, God's blessing does
not terminate with the death of the righteous man, but it extends even to his
children.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Depart from evil, and do
good.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this verse David argues, that,
in order to realize the blessedness of which he has spoken, we must abstain from
all evil, perform the duties of humanity, and exert ourselves in doing good to
our neighbors. This doctrine is at variance with the dictates of corrupt human
nature; but it is, notwithstanding, certain that many of the troubles and
distresses in which the whole human race are involved, proceed from no other
cause than this, that every man respectively, in his own sphere, being given to
injustice, fraud, extortion, and evil-dealing, contemptuously rejects the
blessing of God. Thus, it is in consequence of the barriers which men throw in
their own way, that they do not attain happiness in this world, and that every
man in his own place does not possess the peace and quietness which belong to
him. It is then with the highest propriety that David passes from the doctrine
of the preceding context to this exhortation: for if the meek possess the earth,
then every one, as he regards his own happiness and peace, ought also to
endeavor to walk uprightly, and to apply himself to works of beneficence. It
should also be observed, that he connects these two things, first, that the
faithful should strictly do good; and, secondly, that they should restrain
themselves from doing evil: and this he does not without good reason: for as we
have seen in the thirty-fourth psalm, it often happens that the same person who
not only acts kindly towards certain persons, but even with a bountiful hand
deals out largely of his own, is yet all the while plundering others, and
amassing by extortion the resources by means of which he displays his
liberality. Whoever, therefore, is desirous to have his good offices approved by
God, let him endeavor to relieve his brethren who have need of his help, but let
him not injure one in order to help another, or afflict and grieve one in order
to make another glad. Now David, under these two expressions, has briefly
comprised the duties of the second table of the law: first, that the godly
should keep their hands free from all mischief, and give no occasion of
complaint to any man; and, secondly, that they should not live to themselves,
and to the promotion merely of their own private interests, but should endeavor
to promote the common good of all according to their opportunities, and as far
as they are able. But we have already said, that the blessing which is promised
to the righteous, that "they shall inherit the earth," is not always realised in
an equal degree as to all the people of God; and the reason we assigned for this
is, that God cannot find among men an example of such great uprightness, but
that even the most perfect procure to themselves much misery by their own fault:
and therefore it need not surprise us though God withdraw, at least in some
measure, his blessing even from his own. We know too to what excess the lusts of
the flesh run riot, unless the Lord lay a restraint upon them. Besides, there is
no one who is ready cheerfully to engage in meditation upon the divine life, who
is not urged and encouraged to it by various motives. Hence it is that the
possession of the earth, which David here assigns to the children of God, does
not (as the lawyers would define the term) always consist in having the feet
planted within it, and in being securely established in it; for there are many
sources of disquietude and affliction here to trouble them. And yet it does not
follow that it is a mere fiction or imaginary thing which he promises. For
although daily experience shows us that the children of God do not as yet
inherit the earth, yet, according to the measure of our faith, we feel how
efficacious the blessing of God is, which, like a spring that cannot be drained,
flows continually. They are indeed more than blind who do not perceive that the
righteous have at present this reward, that God defends and upholds them by his
power.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28<i>.</i>
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For Jehovah loveth
judgement.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This, it ought to be
observed, is a confirmation of the doctrine contained in the preceding sentence;
and it is here made to rest upon a higher principle, namely, that God takes
pleasure in righteousness and truth. The argument indeed appears to be
incomplete; but as David takes for granted &#8212; what ought to be deeply fixed
in the hearts of all the faithful &#8212; that the world is directed by the
providence of God, his conclusion is admirable. In the first place, then, it
must be admitted that the condition of the human race is not under the direction
of chance, but of the providence of God, and that the world is conducted and
governed by his counsel: so that he regulates according to his pleasure the
issue of all things, and controls them by his power; and, secondly, to this it
must be added what David here states, that righteousness and truth are pleasing
to God. Hence it follows, that all who lead an upright and blameless life among
men shall be happy, because, enjoying the favor of God, every thing at length
must in regard to them have a happy and successful result. But let us bear in
mind, that the promise which is spoken of in this verse is to be understood in
this sense, that while God has undertaken the preservation of the godly, it is
not to cherish them continually in retirement and ease, but after he has for a
time exercised them under the cross, at length to come to their help: for the
language here employed, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah
forsaketh not his meek ones</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is tacitly
very emphatic. Those, therefore, who separate the exercise of patience from the
favor which God bestows upon the godly in this life, misinterpret this psalm. On
the contrary, lest any one should hastily and rashly pronounce judgment, the
prophet entreats the faithful to suspend their judgment, until God manifest his
displeasure after the death of the wicked, in inflicting punishment upon their
posterity: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The seed of the wicked
shall be cut off</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is of the same
import as if he had again asserted, that although the judgements of God are not
immediately executed upon the wicked and ungodly, yet they are not on that
account anything the better of it, since the punishment justly due to them will
extend to their children. If then the curse of God is not forthwith inflicted
upon them, it need not surprise us if he delay for a time to manifest the favor
which he bears towards the
faithful.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29<i>.</i>
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The righteous shall inherit
the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The repetition of the same
doctrine here is not superfluous, since it is so very difficult to impress it
deeply upon our minds. For while all men seek after happiness, scarcely one in a
hundred looks for it from God, but rather all, on the contrary, in making
provision for themselves, provoke the vengeance of God, as it were deliberately,
and strive to excel each other in doing so, so that some of them stain
themselves with fraud and perjury, some indulge in robbery and extortion, some
practice all sorts of cruelty, and others commit violence and outrage even with
the sword and poison. Moreover, I have just now, and on several other occasions,
stated the sense in which this everlasting habitation upon the earth, which is
here promised to the righteous, is to be understood, namely, that although they
are surrounded by the troubles and changes which occur in this world, yet God
preserves them under his wings; and although there is nothing lasting or stable
under heaven, yet he keeps them in safety as if they were sheltered in a secure
haven. And, finally, they enjoy in addition to this that inward peace of mind
which is better than a hundred lives, and which is therefore justly regarded as
a privilege surpassing in value and importance all
others.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

will speak wisdom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As it is customary
with hypocrites confidently to draw to their own advantage whatever the Spirit
of God declares concerning the just and upright, David here gives a definition
of the righteousness which God requires on the part of his children, and divides
it into three principal parts &#8212; that their speech should be in sincerity
and truth; that the law of God should reign in their heart; and that they should
order their conversation aright. Some give a different exposition of the first
part from what we have given: they say that the righteous serve as teachers and
guides, by instructing others to live well, and leading them in the way; and,
therefore, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to speak
wisdom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to utter
judgment,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is, in their view, of the same
import as to instruct others in holy doctrine, and to train them to the fear of
God. I do not altogether disapprove of this exposition, but I fear it is too
restricted. Wisdom and uprightness are here opposed as much to the profane and
filthy language by which the wicked endeavor to blot out the name of God, as to
cunning and fraud, and every species of stratagem and deceit; and also to the
threats and terrors by which they endeavor to frighten the
simple.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb43</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The meaning therefore is, first, that
the righteous speak honourably and reverently of the righteousness of God, that
they may cherish in themselves and others, to a large extent, the knowledge and
the fear of God;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon"> fb44
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">secondly, that both in their own affairs and
those of others, they approve, without disguise or deceit, of what is just and
reasonable, and are not given to justify what is wrong under the color and
varnish of sophistry; and, finally, that they never depart from the
truth.</font><br><font face="Palatino">To this there is added integrity of
heart: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The law of the Lord is in
his heart.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This, though it should
precede in point of order, is not improperly put in the second place here. For
the Scriptures are not particular in observing an exact arrangement in the
enumeration of virtues and vices. Besides, the source whence this integrity of
heart proceeds is, that the Law of God has its seat in the heart; and it is it
alone which prescribes the best rule of life, restrains all the depraved
affections and lusts, and imbues the minds of men with the love of
righteousness. No man will constantly and steadily devote himself to a life of
uprightness, exert himself in behalf of others in preference to his own personal
interests, renounce covetousness, subdue pride, and maintain a constant warfare
with his own nature, unless he is endued with the fear of God. There next
follows the third division, which relates to the external conduct:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His steps shall not
slide</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some, indeed, think that this is
a promise; but I have no doubt, that in this clause David still continues the
definition of righteousness. The meaning therefore is, that although the
children of God are tempted in a variety of ways to commit sin, and many things
occur urging them to it, &#8212; and although men, for the most part, too,
endeavor, as far as in them lies, by their maliciousness to turn them aside from
the fear of God, &#8212; yet, because the Law of God rules and reigns in their
hearts, they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>do not
slide</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>but stand to their purpose with
firm and determined resolution, or at least adhere to the right
course.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>32.</b><i> </i>and<i> </i><b>33.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The wicked watcheth the
righteous</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc. </i>David here illustrates
more plainly the nature of the possession of the earth, of which he had spoken,
namely, that God preserves his own people, though they are beset with enemies
round about. And hence we are again taught, that the faithful are not promised
in the preceding context a quiet state of life, and one free from all trouble
and distress. If so, these two statements would be contradictory: first, that
the faithful possessing an inheritance, enjoy repose and pleasure; and,
secondly, that yet they are daily delivered as sheep out of the mouth of wolves.
These two verses, however, contain this special ground of consolation, that the
faithful, though surrounded by such a variety of dangers, shall notwithstanding
escape, and be preserved in safety by the help of God. Accordingly, David here
teaches them, that when they shall see their enemies lying in wait for them, and
seeking by every means in their power to annoy them, they, on the contrary,
ought to consider how deeply interested God is in the welfare of his own people,
and how carefully he watches over them to preserve them in safety. David indeed
confesses that the stratagems to which the wicked have recourse in seeking not
only to deprive good men of their property, but even to take away their lives,
are terrible in themselves, because they cruelly plot their destruction; but
still he teaches us at the same time, that we ought to continue to preserve firm
and undaunted courage, because God has promised that he will be our guardian and
defender: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah will not leave
him in his hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This circumstance,
however, ought to be considered, that God does not always grant us deliverance
at the first, but often delays it till we seem to be even at the point of death.
In the last clause of the verse, we are also admonished, that however carefully
good men may guard against giving offense to any, and endeavor to secure the
good-will of all, and shun debate and strife, yet they shall not be exempted
from false accusations: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah
will not condemn them when they are judged</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>David does not say that they shall receive the applause of the world, and
that their virtues shall be celebrated in such praises as they deserve; but he
exhorts them, when they shall be haled to judgment, and as it were overwhelmed
with slander, so that they already resemble those who are condemned, to rest
contented with the protection of God, who will at length manifest their
innocence, and maintain it against the unrighteous judgments of men. If any one
object, that, on the contrary, many of the children of God, after having been
condemned, have suffered a cruel and bitter death, I answer, that their avenger
nevertheless is in heaven. Christ was put to death in the most cruel form, and
in circumstances of the deepest ignominy, but notwithstanding, as the prophet
Isaiah says,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
53:8, "he was taken from that distress and condemnation;"<i> </i>and in the same
manner God is still acting daily towards those who are his members. If it may
still be objected, that David is here discoursing not of the life to come, but
of the state of the godly in the present life, I must again repeat in answer to
this, the explanation which I have given before, namely, that earthly blessings
are at God's disposal, and are regulated entirely according to his will; and
hence it is that he never bestows them in an equal measure upon all, but
according to his wisdom, and as he sees meet, sometimes withdrawing them either
in whole or in part, and at other times displaying them to the view of all.
Accordingly, it may happen, that the holy martyrs, after they have been
condemned, may also be put to death, as if God had forsaken them; but this is
only because it is better for themselves, and because they desire nothing more
than to glorify God by their death. Yet he who permits the ungodly to exercise
their cruelty, ceases not to be the assertor of the righteousness of his
servants: for he openly shows before his angels, and before his whole Church,
that he approves it, and declares that he will make inquisition for it; nay,
more, raising them from the darkness in which they have been hid, he makes their
ashes yield a sweet and pleasant odour. Finally, after the Lord has suffered
them to be overwhelmed by reproach and violence, he will pronounce the judgment
by which he will vindicate their righteous cause from wicked calumnies and false
accusations.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

style of exhortation, in order that the faithful, trusting to God's promises and
sustained by them, may not suffer themselves to be drawn hither and thither by
any temptations through devious and sinful ways, but may persevere steadfastly
in the service of God. In the first place, he exhorts them to hope and patience,
as if he wished them, amidst the tumults and troubles of life, to trust in God,
and hold their peace till he again show them his countenance, which for a time
he had hid from them. Hence arises, in the second place, another exhortation,
that they should not turn aside from the way of the Lord; for wherever hope and
patience prevail, they will so restrain the minds of men that they will not
break out into any thing unlawful and wicked. It will doubtless be found, that
the reason why every man endeavors to promote his own advantage by wicked
practices is, that no one depends upon God, or else that he thinks, if fortune
do not quickly smile upon him, that it is vain for him to persevere in the
practice of equity and uprightness. Moreover, we may learn from this place, that
if many, even of the good and the upright, are subjected to poverty, and lead a
life of protracted affliction and trial, they suffer their punishment justly,
because, so far from being firmly persuaded that it belongs to God as his proper
office not only to lift up his servants from the dunghill, but also to bring
them forth even from their graves, scarcely one in a hundred of them patiently
waits upon God, and continues perseveringly in the right course. Nor is it
without good reason that David makes use of the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>exalt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that we may know that God often stretches forth his hand to the faithful
when they appear to be overwhelmed by the weight of their calamities. He then
adds, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wicked</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>shall perish before the eyes of the godly. If their end were not very
different from that of the righteous, the state in which the reprobate now
rejoice for a time would easily allure even the best of men to evil. And,
indeed, God would make us daily to behold such sights if we had eyes to behold
his judgments. And yet, although the whole world were blinded, God does not
cease to render a just reward to the wickedness of men; but by punishing them in
a more private manner, he withdraws from us that fruit of which our own dulness
deprives us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>35. </b>and<b> 36<i>.</i></b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have seen the wicked
terrible</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc<i>. </i>David here
confirms from his own experience what I have just said, namely, that although
the wicked are intoxicated with their prosperity, and held in admiration by all
on account of it, yet their happiness is transitory and evanescent, and,
therefore, nothing else than a mere illusion. In the 35th verse he tells us,
that it is no strange or unwonted thing for the ungodly, puffed up with their
prosperity, to spread themselves far and wide, and to give occasion of terror to
the innocent. Then he adds, that their greatness, which had been regarded with
so much wonder, disappears in a moment. As to the meaning of the words,

for <i>to vanish away; </i>and thus he admonishes us to sit still for a time, in

admires in the prosperity of the wicked has been only a
mist.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

diligently to consider every instance they may meet with of the grace of God, as
well as of his judgment; but he teaches, at the same time, that it is in vain
for any to sit in judgment upon the first aspect of things. When men do not wait
patiently and quietly the time which God has appointed in his good pleasure, it
often happens that faith is extinguished, and trust in the promises of God, at
the same time, perishes with it. This is the reason why David exhorts us to
observe and consider, for when our minds are preoccupied by the temptation which
is once presented to our view, hasty judgment is then the cause of our being
deceived. But if a man extend his view, as if it were from a watch-tower, to a
great distance, he will find that it has been said with truth, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the

length very different. This clause, with respect to the end of these two classes
of men, seems to be added by way of caution, that we may learn to suspend our
judgment, if God should not immediately accomplish what he has spoken. If we
should become impatient in our desires, let us moderate our minds by the
reflection, that the end is not yet come, and that it behoves us to give God
time to restore to order the confused state of things. Some explain the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tyrja</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>acharith, </i>which we have rendered the end<i> </i>of the wicked, of their
posterity. This, however, is incorrect. David refers only to the difference
which subsists between them and the righteous in the end; for God, after he has
severely tried his servants, and exercised their patience, in the end converts
their adversity into a blessing, while he turns the mirth of the ungodly into
mourning.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>39<i>.</i>
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The salvation of the
righteous is from Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The sum of
the whole is, that whatever may happen, the righteous shall be saved, because
they are in the hand of God, and can never be forgotten by him. This ought to be
particularly noticed, that those who are greatly afflicted may be sustained by
the assurance that the salvation which they expect from God is infallibly
certain, because God is eternal, and governs the world by his power; as Christ
said,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">David still inculcates this principle, that as
righteousness is approved of God, it can never happen that he should forsake his
faithful servants, and deprive them of his help. He, therefore, exhorts true
believers to depend upon God, not only when things prosper according to their
desires, but even when they are sorely afflicted. By these words he teaches that
it is enough, if God only impart strength to his servants, so that, when
severely afflicted and oppressed with anguish, they may not faint under it, or
that, when groaning under the weight of severe afflictions, they may not sink
under the burden. To the same purpose also is the expression which David uses
twice in the last verse, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God
will deliver</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By this he admonishes the
children of God to learn patiently to endure afflictions, and that, if God
should prolong them, they should often recall this to their remembrance, that
after he has tried their patience, he will in the end deliver
them.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The title of this psalm refers to its subject. Some
suppose that it is the beginning of a common song, because in other psalms the
beginning of the song, to the tune of which they were set, is commonly prefixed:
but such an interpretation is unnatural, and without foundation. Instead of
this, I rather think that the title indicates that David composed this psalm as
a memorial for himself, as well as others, lest he should too soon forget the
chastisement by which God had afflicted him. He knew how easily and speedily the
chastisements with which God visits us, and which ought to serve as a means of
instruction to us all our life, pass away from the mind. He was also mindful of
his own high calling; for, as he was appointed master and teacher over the whole
Church, it was necessary that whatever he had himself learned in particular by
divine teaching should be made known, and appropriated to the use of all, that
all might profit thereby. Thus we are admonished that it is a very profitable
exercise often to recall to remembrance the chastisements with which God has
afflicted us for our sins.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Jehovah! rebuke me not
in thy wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As I have already
expounded this verse in the beginning of the sixth psalm, where it occurs, and
that I may not prove tedious to the reader, I shall notice it more briefly here.
David does not expressly ask that his afflictions should be removed, but only
that God would moderate the severity of his chastisements. Hence we may infer,
that David did not give loose reins to the desires of the flesh, but offered up
his earnest prayer in a duly chastened spirit of devotion. All men would
naturally desire that permission should be granted them to sin with impunity.
But David lays a restraint upon his desires, and does not wish the favor and
indulgence of God to be extended beyond measure, but is content with a
mitigation of his affliction; as if he had said, Lord, I am not unwilling to be
chastised by thee, but I entreat thee, meanwhile, not to afflict me beyond what
I am able to bear, but to temper the fierceness of thy indignation according to
the measure of my infirmity, lest the severity of the affliction should entirely
overwhelm me. This prayer, as I have said, was framed according to the rule of
godliness; for it contains nothing but what God promises to all his children. It
should also be noticed, that David does not secretly indulge a fretful and
repining spirit, but spreads his complaint before God; and this he does, not in
the way of sinful complaining, but of humble prayer and unfeigned confession,
accompanied with the hope of obtaining forgiveness. He has used <i>anger </i>and
<i>wrath </i>as denoting extreme rigour, and has contrasted them with fatherly
chastisement.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thy arrows go down in
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He shows that he was constrained by dire
necessity to ask an alleviation of his misery; for he was crushed under the
weight of the burden which he sustained. This rule is always to be observed in
our prayers &#8212; to keep God's promises present to our view. But God has
promised that he will chastise his servants, not according to their deserts, but
as they are able to bear. This is the reason why the saints so often speak of
their own weakness, when they are severely oppressed with affliction. David very
properly describes the malady under which he labored, by the terms,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
arrows</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or the chastisement <i>of God.
</i>Had he not been persuaded that it was God who thus afflicted him, he could
never have been brought to seek from him deliverance from his affliction. We
know that the great majority of men are blinded under the judgments of God, and
imagine that they are entirely the events of chance; and scarcely one in a
hundred discerns in them the hand of God. But, in his sickness, as in all his
other adversities, David views the hand of God lifted up to punish him for his
sins. And certainly, the man who estimates his affliction only by the feeling of
pain which it produces, and views it in no other light, differs nothing from the
beasts of the field. As every chastisement of God should remind us of his
judgment, the true wisdom of the saints, as the prophet
declares,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"to look to the hand of
him who smiteth."&#8212;
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230913&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
9:13)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The pronoun
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is<i> </i>therefore emphatic. David's words are, as if he had said, I have
not to do with a mortal man, who can shoot his arrows with a force only in
proportion to his own strength, but I have to do with God, who can discharge the
arrows that come from his hand with a force altogether
overwhelming.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There is no soundness in my
flesh because of thy anger</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Others
translate, <i>There is no beauty; </i>but this does not seem to be so suitable.
In the clause which follows, David ascribes to God the praise of righteousness,
without which, the acknowledgement which he formerly made would be of little
avail; nay, instead of this, such an acknowledgement sometimes rather
exasperates the minds of men, so that they provoke the wrath of God still more,
by charging him with cruelty, and pouring forth horrible blasphemies against
him. Nothing, therefore, can be more preposterous, than to imagine that there is
in God a power so supreme and absolute, (as it is termed,) as to deprive him of
his righteousness. David, as soon as he recognised his affliction as coming from
God, turns to his own sin as the cause of the Divine displeasure; for he had
already been fully satisfied in his own mind, that he is not like a tyrant who
exercises cruelty needlessly and at random, but a righteous judge, who never
manifests his displeasure by inflicting judgments but when he is grievously
offended. If, then, we would render to God the praise which is due to him, let
us learn by the example of David to connect our sins with his
wrath.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For my iniquities have
passed over my head.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here he complains
that he is overwhelmed by his sins as by a heavy burden, so that he utterly
faints under their weight; and yet he again confirms the doctrine which we have
already stated, that he deservedly suffered the wrath of God, which had been
inflicted on him in a manner so severe and dreadful. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;w[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>avon, </i>which we have translated
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>iniquities</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>no doubt often <i>signifies punishment, </i>but this is only in a secondary
and metaphorical sense. I am also willing to admit, that David assigns to the
effect what is proper to the cause, when he describes by the appellation
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>iniquities</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>the punishment which he had procured by his own sin; and yet his object at
the same time is plainly and distinctly to confess, that all the afflictions
which he suffered were to be imputed to his sins. He quarrels not with God for
the extreme severity of his punishment, as Cain did, who said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><i>"</i>My<i>
</i>punishment is greater than I can bear,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010413&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
4:13.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is true, indeed, that Moses uses the same word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;w[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>avon, </i>in that passage, so that there is some similarity between the
language of David and Cain. But David's meaning is very different. When such
temptations as these were insinuating themselves into his mind, Could God
afflict thee more severely than he does? certainly, since he is doing nothing to
relieve thee, it is a sure sign that he wishes thee destroyed and brought to
nought; he not only despises thy sighs and groanings, but the more he seeth thee
cast down and forsaken, he pursueth thee the more fiercely and with the greater
rigour; &#8212; to preclude the entrance of such evil thoughts and surmisings,
he defended himself as with a shield by this consideration, that he was
afflicted by the just judgment of God. He has here attributed to his own sins as
the cause the weight of the wrath of God which he felt; and, as we shall find in
the following verse, he again acknowledges, that what he is now suffering was
procured by his own foolishness. Although, then, in bewailing his own miseries,
he may seem in some measure to quarrel with God, yet he still cherishes the
humble conviction, (for God afflicteth not beyond measure,) that there is no
rest for him but in imploring the Divine compassion and forgiveness; whereas the
ungodly, although convicted by their own consciences of guilt, murmur against
God, like the wild beasts, which, in their rage, gnaw the chains with which they
are
bound.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5<i>.</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>

sufficiently chastised his people, he is quickly pacified towards them; nay,
more, that if he continue to manifest his displeasure for too long a time, he
becomes through his mercy, as it were, weary of it, so that he hastens to give
deliverance, as he says in another
place,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"For my name's sake will I
defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not
off. Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the

48:9, 10)</font><br><font face="Palatino">The object, therefore, which David has
in view, in complaining of the long continuance of his misery is, that when he
had endured the punishment which he had merited, he might at length obtain
deliverance. It was certainly no slight trial to this servant of God to be thus
kept in continual languishing, and, as it were, to putrify and be dissolved into
corruption in his miseries. In this his constancy is the more to be admired, for
it neither broke down from the long period of delay, nor failed under the
immense load of suffering. By using the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>foolishness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>instead of <i>sin, </i>he does not seek in this way to extenuate his faults,
as hypocrites do when they are unable to escape the charge of guilt; for in
order to excuse themselves in part, they allege the false pretense of ignorance,
pleading, and wishing it to be believed, that they erred through imprudence and
inadvertence. But, according to a common mode of expression in the Hebrew
language, by the use of the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>foolishness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he acknowledges that he had been out of his right mind, when he obeyed the
lusts of the flesh in opposition to God. The Spirit, by employing this term in
so many places to designate crimes the most atrocious, does not certainly mean
to extenuate the criminality of men, as if they were guilty merely of some
slight offenses, but rather charges them with maniacal fury, because, blinded by
unhallowed desires, they wilfully fly in the face of their Maker. Accordingly,
sin is always conjoined with folly or, madness. It is in this sense that David
speaks of his own foolishness; as if he had said, that he was void of reason and
transported with madness, like the infatuated rage of wild beasts, when he
neglected God and followed his own
lusts.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

sufficiently strong to bear up his mind. When he says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bowed
down</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he seems tacitly to contrast his
humility and dejection with the pride and stubbornness of many, who refuse to be
humbled by the many chastisements with which God afflicts them, but rather
harden themselves, daring to resist and oppose him. They must, no doubt, of
necessity, feel the pain of their afflictions, but they fall into such a state
of insensibility, that they are not affected by it. David then, from this
circumstance, draws an argument to induce his heavenly Judge to have compassion
on him, showing that he was not one of those who obstinately rebel against him,
and refuse to bow in humble submission, even while the hand of God is upon them;
but that he is abased and humbled, even as the Apostle Peter exhorts all the
godly to</font><br></div>

God."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1

<div><font face="Palatino">Let us therefore learn, that there is no other way by
which we can obtain consolation under our afflictions, than by laying aside all
stubbornness and pride, and humbly submitting to the chastisement of God. The

fb53</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and explained as referring to the
outward apparel, the black color of which has always been a token of grief. But
the opinion of those who understand it of the blackness of the skin is more
correct; for we know that grief renders men's countenances lean, wan, and black.
David, therefore, by this token of grief, describes the greatness of his
affliction, because the natural color of his face had faded, and he was like a
corpse, already withered and shrunk.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the next
verse, the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ylsk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kesalaim, </i>which I have rendered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>reins</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>is by some translated <i>the flanks. </i>But the more generally received
opinion is, that it denotes the part under the reins, which extends towards the
haunch, or the space between the thighs and flanks, where it is supposed there
had been a sore. Commentators also differ in their opinion respecting the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlqn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nikleh, </i>which I have rendered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>burning</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>In my translation I have followed those who adhere to the original meaning
of the word; for the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kalah, </i>signifies <i>to burn, </i>or <i>to consume with fire. </i>Others,
indeed, explain it not improperly in the sense <i>of filthiness and corruption.
</i>I am, however, not inclined to limit it to a sore. In my opinion, the sense
simply is, that his reins, or flanks, or thighs, were filled with an
inflammatory disease, or at least were covered over with putrid sores; for these
parts of the body are most subject to inflammation, and most liable to contract
putrid humours. Some expound it allegorically, as meaning, that David seemed
loathsome in his own eyes, when he thought of his reproach; but this appears too
forced. When he adds that he was <i>weakened </i>and <i>sore broken, </i>he
still farther confirms what he had said in the preceding verses: for by these
various terms he wished to express the intolerable vehemence of his grief. Now,
as a man, who is distinguished by courage, does not cry out and complain, and as
we know that David did not shrink in bearing his afflictions, we may gather from
this, that his sufferings were severe and painful in the extreme, inasmuch as he
not only wept bitterly, but was also forced to cry out and complain. The noun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tmhn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nahamath, </i>which I have rendered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>roaring</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>may be derived from another verb than that which David has here used; but
the meaning is obvious, namely, that the incontrollable emotions of his heart
forced him to cry out.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Lord! thou knowest all
my desire.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He adds this, not so much in
respect of God, as to strengthen himself in the hope of obtaining some
alleviation of his trouble, and thus to animate himself to persevering prayer.
It may be explained in a twofold sense, either as denoting his confident
assurance that his prayers and groanings were heard by the Lord, or a simple
declaration that he had poured out before God all his cares and troubles; but
the meaning is substantially the same: for as long as men entertain any doubt
whether their groanings have come up before God, they are kept in constant
disquietude and dread, which so fetters and holds captive their minds, that they
cannot elevate their souls to God. On the contrary, a firm persuasion that our
groanings do not vanish away in their ascent to God, but that he graciously
hears them, and familiarly listens to them, produces promptitude and alacrity in
engaging in prayer. It might, therefore, prove no small ground of encouragement
to David, that he approached God, not with a doubting and trembling heart, but
strengthened and encouraged by the assurance of which we have spoken, and of
which he himself speaks in another place, that his tears were laid up in God's
bottle,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;195608&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
56:8.) In order that we may obtain access to God, we must believe that he is "a
rewarder of them that diligently seek him," as the apostle states in his Epistle
to the Hebrews,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:6.) But I rather approve of the other interpretation, That David here
declares that he had disburdened all his sorrows into the bosom of God. The
reason why the greater part of men derive no profit from complaining grievously
in their sorrow is, that they direct not their prayers and sighs to God. David,
then, in order to encourage himself in the assured conviction that God will be
his deliverer, says, that he had always been a witness of his sorrows, and was
well acquainted with them, because he had neither indulged in a fretful spirit,
nor poured out into the air his complaints and howlings as the unbelieving are
wont to do, but had spread out before God himself all the desires of his
heart.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10<i>.</i>
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My heart hath turned
round</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The verb which David here uses
signifies <i>to travel </i>or <i>wander hither and thither; </i>but here it is
taken for the agitation or disquietude which distress of heart engenders when we
know not what to do. According as men are disquieted in mind, so do they turn
themselves on all sides, and so their heart may be said to turn round, or to run
to and fro. But since faith, when it has once brought us into obedience to God,
holds our minds fixed on his word, it might here be asked by way of objection,
How it is that the heart of David was so affected by disquietude and trouble? To
this I answer, That although he continued to walk in the ways of God, while he
was sustained by the promises of God, yet he was not altogether exempted from
human infirmity. And, indeed, it will always happen, that as soon as we fall
into some danger, our flesh will suggest to us various shifts and devices, and
lead us into many errors in search of counsel; so that even the most confident
would fail and go astray, unless he laid upon himself the same restraint by
which David was preserved and kept in subjection, namely, by keeping all his
thoughts shut up within the limits of God's word. Nay, even in the prayers which
we offer up when our minds are at ease, we experience too well how easily our
minds are carried away, and wander after vain and frivolous thoughts, and how
difficult it is to keep them uninterruptedly attentive and fixed with the same
degree of intensity upon the object of our desire. If this happen when we are
not exercised by any severe trial, what will be the case when we are agitated by
violent storms and tempests which threaten a thousand deaths, and when there is
no way to escape them? It is, therefore, no great wonder if they carried away
the heart of David, so that it was subject to various emotions amidst such
tempestuous agitations. He adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his strength had
failed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>as if he had compared himself to a dead man. What he adds concerning
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the light of his
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>some understand as if he had said,
that he was so much oppressed with despair on all sides, that no counsel or
foresight was left to him. The more simple meaning, however, is, that the light
of life was taken away from him, because in it the energy of the soul
principally shows itself.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></b><i>My friends and my companions stand away from my
sore</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here David enumerates other
circumstances to show the aggravated character of his misery, that he might
excite the compassion of God. One of these is, that he finds no help or solace
among men. In saying that his friends
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stand away from
him,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he means, that they cease from
performing any of the offices of humanity towards him. This might happen either
from pride or fear. If they withdrew from this poor afflicted man because they
despised him, they were cruel and proud; and if they refused him their
assistance for fear of being brought into odium, it was most unpardonable
cowardice. But in the meantime, it augmented not a little the calamity of David,
that even his friends and kinsfolk dared not to show any token of compassion
towards him. It is, indeed, a very sore trial, when a man, who has had a great
number of friends, comes to be abandoned by them
all.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They also that sought for
my life have laid snares for me,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>etc..
Here another circumstance is added, that the enemies of David laid snares for
him, and talked about his destruction, and framed deceits among
themselves.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb54</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The purport of what is stated is, that
while his friends cowardly sit still and will do nothing to aid him, his enemies
vigorously bestir themselves, and seek by every means to destroy him. He says
that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they seek his
life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>for as they were his deadly
enemies and blood-thirsty men, they were not content with doing him some common
injury, but furiously sought his destruction. He, however, here complains not so
much that they assailed him by force of arms and with violence, as he accuses
them of guileful conspiracy, which he designates in the first place
metaphorically by the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>snares</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and afterwards adds in plain terms, that they <i>talk about his destruction,
</i>and secretly consult among themselves how they might do him hurt. Now, as it
is certain that David borrows not an artificial rhetoric from the bar, (as
profane orators</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb55</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> do when they plead their cause,) in
order to win the favor of God, but rather draws his arguments from the Word of
God, the sentences which he here brings together for the confirmation of his
faith we ought to appropriate to our own use. If we are altogether destitute of
human aid and assistance, if our friends fail us in the time of need, and if
others seek our ruin, and breathe out nothing but destruction against us, let us
remember that it is not in vain for us to lay these things in prayer before God,
whose province it is to succor those who are in misery, to take under his
protection those who are perfidiously forsaken and betrayed, to restrain the
wicked, and not only to withstand their violence, but also to anticipate their
deceitful counsels and to frustrate their
designs.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13<i>.</i>
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But I, as a deaf man, hear
not,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>etc<i>. </i>The inspired writer
here compares himself to a dumb and deaf man, for two reasons. In the first
place, he intimates that he was so overwhelmed with the false and wicked
judgments of his enemies, that he was not even permitted to open his mouth in
his own defense. In the second place, he alleges before God his own patience, as
a plea to induce God the more readily to have pity upon him; for such meekness
and gentleness, not only with good reason, secures favor to the afflicted and
the innocent, but it is also a sign of true piety. Those who depend upon the
world, and have respect only to men, if they cannot avenge the injuries that are
done them, plainly show by their loud complaints the burning rage and fury of
their hearts. In order, therefore, that a man may quietly and patiently endure
the insolence, violence, calumny, and deceit of his enemies, it is necessary
that he trust in God. The man who is fully persuaded in his own heart that God
is his defender, will cherish his hope in silence, and, calling upon him for
help, will lay a restraint upon his own passions. Accordingly, Paul, in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
12:19, very properly says, that we "give place unto wrath" when, oppressed
before the world, we nevertheless still repose on God. On the other hand,
whoever gives loose reins to his passions, takes away as much as he can from
God, to whom alone it belongs, the right of taking vengeance, and deprives
himself of his assistance. It is indeed certain, that if David had obtained a
hearing, he would have been ready to defend his own innocence; but perceiving
that it availed him nothing, nay, that he was shut out and debarred from all
defense of his cause, he humbly submitted, waiting patiently for the heavenly
Judge. He therefore says that he held his peace, as if he had already been
convicted and struck dumb. And it is indeed very difficult, when we are
conscious of our own innocence, patiently and silently to bear an unjust
condemnation, as if all argument had failed us, and we had no excuse or reply
left us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For on thee, O Jehovah! do I
wait.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David here shows the source of his
patience. It consisted in this, that, trusting in the grace of God, he overcame
all the temptations of the world. And certainly, the mind of man will never be
framed to gentleness and meekness, nor will he be able to subdue his passions,
until he has learned never to give up hope. The Psalmist, at the same time,
adds, that he cherished his hope by constant meditation, lest he should yield to
despair. And this is the only means of our perseverance, when, on the ground of
his own promises, with which we are furnished, we appeal to him, yea, rather
when setting before our view his fidelity and his constancy in fulfilling what
he has promised, we are sureties to ourselves for him. Accordingly, Paul, in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450504&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
5:4, very properly joins patience to hope and consolation. The repetition of
terms in this verse shows, that this holy man was subjected to a severe and
arduous conflict.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Lord! my God, wilt
answer me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>His language implies, that if
God should delay to come to his help, there was reason to fear that he would
faint from weariness, or fall into despair, unless, setting this double defense
before him, he persevered valiantly in the
conflict.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16<i>.</i>
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I said, lest they rejoice
over me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here he also confirms his faith
and his earnestness in prayer from this consideration, that if he should be
forsaken of God, his enemies would triumph. This indignity, on their part, is of
no small weight in inducing God to help us; for the wicked, in thus magnifying
themselves against us, and indulging in derision, not only make war with our
flesh, but also directly assail our faith and endeavor to destroy whatever there
is of religion and the fear of God in our hearts. What is the object of all
their mockery, but to persuade us that what God has promised is vain and
worthless? The Psalmist immediately adds, that it is not without cause that he
is struck with the fear that his enemies would rejoice over him, since he had
already had experience of their proud boastings. We are taught from this
passage, that in proportion as our enemies increase in insolence and cruelty
towards us, or, seeing us already overwhelmed by a heavy load of adversities, in
their proud disdain trample us under their feet, we ought to cherish the greater
hope that God will come to our help.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Surely I am ready to
halt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This verse has led expositors to
suppose that David was afflicted with some sore, from which he was afraid of
having brought upon him the infirmity of halting all his days; but I have
already shown, in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193515&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
35:15, that this supposition is very improbable. We have certainly no greater
reason for supposing that David was lame than that Jeremiah was so, when he
said,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">I therefore think that David here employs a
metaphorical mode of expression, and that his meaning is, that if God did not
soon come to his aid, there was no hope of his ever being restored to his former
condition; and that he was so greatly afflicted, that he would walk as if he had
been maimed or lame all the days of his
life.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb57</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It next follows by way of exposition,
that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his sorrow was continually
before him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The sense is, that he was so
grievously afflicted, that he could not forget it for a single moment, so as to
obtain some relaxation. In both the clauses of the verse, David confesses that
his disease is incurable, unless he obtain some remedy from God, and that he
cannot endure it, unless he be raised up and sustained by the hand of God
himself. This is the reason why he directs all his thoughts and his requests to
God alone; for as soon as he shall turn aside from him, he sees nothing but
immediate ruin.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18</b> and
<b>19<i>.</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> Surely I
declare my iniquity.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By comparison, he
amplifies what he had just said concerning the pride and the reproachful conduct
of his enemies; for he says, that whilst he is lying in a filthy and wretched
condition, like a wicked man, and one abandoned by God, they fly about in mirth
and gladness, nay, they carry their heads high, because they are rich and
powerful. But first, it is proper to notice in what sense it is that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he declares his
sin.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Those, in my judgment, are
mistaken, who understand this passage simply in the sense of a confession of his
guilt before God, that he might obtain forgiveness. According to their
interpretation, the Psalmist is supposed to repeat here what we have seen he
said</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"I<i> </i>acknowledged my
sin unto thee,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and mine iniquity
have I not hid."&#8212;
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193205&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
32:5)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But in this place he is not speaking so much of his
repentance, as he is bewailing his sad and miserable condition; and, therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sin</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>are to be understood of the afflictions and chastisements which are the
tokens of God's wrath; as if he had said, that the hand of God was against him,
and lying so heavily upon him, that from the very sight of the misery to which
he was reduced, the world in general might regard him as a condemned and
reprobate man. In order to render the meaning more obvious, the 18th and 19th
verses must be read together, thus:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I declare my iniquity, and my
enemies are living; I am dismayed because of my sin, but they are become
strong.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I do not, however, deny that he
regards the miseries to which he was subjected as proceeding from his sins. In
this respect, the godly differ from the wicked, that, being admonished of their
transgression by adversity, they humbly sist themselves before the judgment-seat
of God. Accordingly, judging of the cause from the effects, he takes into
account these two things: First, That thus overwhelmed and afflicted, he is
lying under a heavy load of miseries; and, secondly, That all these evils are
justly inflicted as chastisements for sin.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>living</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fb58</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which he attributes to his enemies, implies as much as to enjoy continued and
abundant prosperity in all things; and therefore he adds, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>are become strong and increase in
power</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I interpret the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bbr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rabbab, </i>in this place,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>increase in
power</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because he would speak improperly
were he to be understood as saying, <i>that they were multiplied. </i>He does
not here complain that they increased in number, but rather exalts their
greatness, because the more they acquired of riches, they acquired so much the
greater audacity in oppressing the good and the simple. He tells us that he is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>assailed by them
wrongfully</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and without cause, that he
may induce God to be the more favorable and propitious to him. And surely, if we
would have the favor of God for our defense, we must always take care not to
injure any man, and to do nothing to provoke the hatred of any against
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This is more fully confirmed in the
following verse, in which he declares that they requited him evil for the good
which he had done them. More than this, however, is implied in the language of
David. It implies that he not only abstained from all hurtful dealing towards
his enemies, but that he had done them all the good which was in his power; and
on this account the rage of the wicked is the less excusable, which not only
moves them to do harm to others without cause, but which likewise cannot be
appeased by any marks of kindness exercised towards them. It is indeed true,
that there is nothing which wounds those of an ingenuous disposition of mind
more than when wicked and ungodly men recompense them in a manner so
dishonorable and unjust; but when they reflect upon this consolatory
consideration, that God is no less offended with such ingratitude than those to
whom the injury is done, they have no reason to be troubled beyond measure. To
mitigate their sorrow, let this doctrine be the subject of their frequent
meditation, That whenever the wicked, to whom we have endeavored to do good,
shall requite us evil for good, God will certainly be their judge. In the last
place, it is added, as the highest degree of their desperate wickedness, that
they hated David because he studied to practice uprightness:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They are opposed to me, because I
follow that which is good</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It must be
admitted, that those are froward and wicked in the extreme, nay, even of a
devilish disposition, who hold uprightness in such abhorrence that they
deliberately make war upon those who follow after it. It is, indeed, a very sore
temptation, that the people of God, the more sincerely they endeavor to serve
him, should procure to themselves so much the more trouble and sorrow; but this
consideration ought to prove a sufficient ground of consolation to them, that
they are not only supported by the testimony of a good conscience, but that they
also know that God is ever ready, and that, too, for this very reason, to
manifest his mercy towards them. On the ground of this assurance, they dare to
appear in the presence of God, and entreat him, as it is his cause as well as
theirs, that he would maintain and defend it. There can be no doubt that David,
by his own example, has prescribed this as a common rule to all the faithful,
rather to incur the hatred and ill-will of the world, than in the least degree

David briefly states the chief point which he desired, and the sum of his whole
prayer; namely, that whereas he was forsaken of men, and grievously afflicted in
every way, God would receive him and raise him up again. He uses three forms of
expression; first, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God would
not forsake him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or cease to take care
of him; secondly, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he would
not be far from him;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and, thirdly, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he would make haste to help

God is always near to his servants, and that he delays not a single moment
longer than is necessary. But, as we have seen in another place, it is not at
all wonderful that the saints, when they unburden themselves of their cares and
sorrows into the bosom of God, should make their requests in language according
to the feeling of the flesh. They are not ashamed to confess their infirmity,
nor is it proper to conceal the doubts which arise in their minds. Although,
however, waiting was wearisome to David according to the flesh, yet in one word
he plainly shows that he did not pray in uncertainty when he calls God <i>his
salvation, </i>or the author of his salvation. Some render it <i>to my</i>
<i>salvation, </i>but this is forced. David rather sets up this as a wall of
defense against all the devices by which, as we have seen, his faith was
assailed, That whatever might happen, he was, nevertheless, well assured of his
salvation in God.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
39</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the beginning of the psalm, David intimates that
his heart had been seized with extreme bitterness of grief, which forced him to
give utterance to complaints with too much vehemence and ardor. He confesses
that whilst he was disposed to be silent, and to exercise patience, he was
nevertheless compelled, by the vehemence of his sorrow, to break out into an
excess which he by no means intended. Then he relates the complaints which he
had made mingled with prayers, which indicate great trouble of mind; so that
from this it appears that he had wrestled with no ordinary effort in resisting
temptation, lest he should fall into despair.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>To the chief
musician, Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is well known that Jeduthun was one of the chief
singers of whom sacred history makes mention.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;130916&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Chronicles 9:16; 16:38, 41, 42) It is, therefore, probable that this psalm was
delivered to the chief singer, who was of his household. Some, indeed,
understand it as denoting the particular kind of tune, and suppose that it was
the beginning of some other song; but this I consider too forced an
interpretation. Nor can I agree with others who suppose that David here
complains of some disease; for unless some urgent reason require it, it is
improper to limit general statements to particular cases. On the contrary, from
the extreme character of the sufferings which he here describes, it may be
presumed that a variety of afflictions is here included, or, at least, that some
one is referred to which was more severe than all the others, and one which had
continued for a long time. Besides, it ought to be considered that in this psalm
David is not proclaiming his own merit, as if in his affliction he had presented
his prayers to God in the language, and according to the spirit dictated by true
piety: he rather confesses the sin of his infirmity in bursting forth into
immoderate sorrow, and in being led by the vehemence of this affection to
indulge in sinful complaints.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
39:1-3	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1</b>. I said, I will take heed
to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a muzzle,
while the wicked standeth before me. <b>2</b>. I was dumb in silence; I held my
peace from good; and my sorrow was stirred. <b>3</b>. My heart became hot within
me; in my musing a fire burned: I spake with my
tongue.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>I said, I will take heed to my
ways.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David explains and illustrates the
greatness of his grief by this circumstance, that, contrary to his inclination
and resolution, he broke forth into the severest complaints. The meaning
substantially is, that although he had subdued his heart to patience, and
resolved to keep silence, yet the violence of his grief was such that it forced
him to break his resolution, and extorted from him, if we might so speak,
expressions which indicate that he had given way to an undue degree of sorrow.
The expression, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
said,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>it is well known, does not always
mean what is expressed in words, but is often used to denote the purpose of the
heart, and, therefore, the words <i>in heart </i>are sometimes added. David,
therefore, means not that he boasted of his fortitude and constancy, and made a
display of them before men, but that before God he was, by continued meditation,
well fortified and prepared to endure patiently the temptations by which he was
now assailed. We ought to mark particularly the carefulness by which he was
distinguished. It was not without cause that he was so much intent on exercising
watchfulness over himself. He did so because he was conscious of his own
weakness, and also well knew the manifold devices of Satan. He, therefore,
looked on the right hand and on the left, and kept watch on all sides, lest
temptation stealing upon him unawares from any quarter might reach even to his
heart. Access to it, then, had been impossible, since it was shut up on every
side, if the extreme severity of his grief had not overpowered him, and broken
his resolution. When he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
will keep my mouth with a muzzle,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb61</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> that I sin not with my
tongue,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>it is not to be understood as if
he could with difficulty restrain and conceal his grief, (for it is mere
pretense for a man to show by the countenance and speech the appearance of
meekness when the heart still swells with pride;) but as there is nothing more
slippery or loose than the tongue, David declares that he had endeavored so
carefully to bridle his affections, that not so much as one word should escape
from his lips which might betray the least impatience. And that man must indeed
be endued with singular fortitude who unfeignedly and deliberately restrains his
tongue, which is so liable to fall into error. As to what follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>while the wicked standeth before
me,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>it is generally understood, as if
David had concealed his grief, lest he should give occasion of blasphemy to the
wicked, who, as soon as they see the children of God fail under the weight of
their afflictions, insolently break forth into derision against them, which
amounts to a contempt of God himself. But it appears to me that by the term
<i>standeth, </i>David meant to express something more, &#8212; that even while
he saw the wicked bearing rule, exercising authority, and exalted to honor, he
resolved not to speak a single word, but to bear patiently the poverty and
indignity which otherwise grieve and torment not a little even good men.
Accordingly, he says not merely that when he was in the presence of the wicked
he restrained himself, lest he should be subjected to their scorn, but that even
while the worst of men prospered,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb62</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and, proud of their high rank, despised
others, he was fully determined in his own mind not to be troubled at it. By
this he very plainly shows that he was so beset with wicked men, ever ready for
mischief, that he could not freely heave a sigh which was not made the subject
of ridicule and scorn. Since, then, it was so hard a task for David to restrain
his tongue, lest he should sin by giving way to complaints, let us learn from
his example, whenever troubles molest us, to strive earnestly to moderate our
affections, that no impious expression of dissatisfaction against God may slip
from us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I was dumb in
silence.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He now declares that this
resolution of which he has spoken had not been a mere passing and momentary
thought, but that he had shown by his conduct that it was indeed a resolution
deeply fixed in his heart. He says, then, that he held his peace for a time,
just as if he had been deaf, which was a singular manifestation of his patience.
When he thus determined to be silent, it was not such a resolution as persons of
a changeable disposition, who scarcely ever know their own mind, and who can
with difficulty be brought to carry their desires into effect, often make: he
had long and steadfastly inured himself to the exercise of patience; and this he
had done, not only by keeping silence but by making himself utterly dumb, as if
he had been deprived of the power of speech. The expression<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from
good</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is expounded by some in the sense
that he not only refrained from uttering sinful and unadvised words, but also
that he abstained from speaking on any subject whatever. Others think that he
held his peace from good, either because, being overwhelmed with miseries and
afflictions, he found no relief to whatever side he turned, or else, because, by
reason of the greatness of his sorrow, he was unable to sing the praises of God.
But in my opinion the natural sense is, that although he was able adequately to
defend himself, and it could not be shown that he wanted just and proper grounds
of complaint, yet he refrained from speaking of his own mere
will.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb63</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He might have encountered the ungodly
with a good defense of his own innocence, but he rather preferred to forego the
prosecution of his righteous cause than indulge in any intemperate sorrow. He
adds in the last clause of the verse, that although he thus restrained himself
for a time, yet at length the violence of his grief broke through all the
barriers which he had set to his tongue. If David, who was so valiant a
champion, failed in the midst of his course, how much greater reason have we to
be afraid lest we fall in like manner? He says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his sorrow was
stirred</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because, as we shall soon see,
the ardor of his affections was inflamed so as to become tumultuous. Some render
the phrase in this sense, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his sorrow was
corrupted</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as if his meaning were, that
it became worse; just as we know that a wound becomes worse when it happens to
putrify or fester: but this sense is
forced.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My heart became hot
within me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He now illustrates the
greatness of his grief by the introduction of a simile, telling us that his
sorrow, being internally suppressed, became so much the more inflamed, until the
ardent passion of his soul continued to increase in strength. From this we may
learn the very profitable lesson, that the more strenuously any one sets himself
to obey God, and employs all his endeavors to attain the exercise of patience,
the more vigorously is he assailed by temptation: for Satan, whilst he is not so
troublesome to the indifferent and careless, and seldom looks near them,
displays all his forces in hostile array against that individual. If, therefore,
at any time we feel ardent emotions struggling and raising a commotion in our
breasts, we should call to remembrance this conflict of David, that our courage
may not fail us, or at least that our infirmity may not drive us headlong to
despair. The dry and hot exhalations which the sun causes to arise in summer, if
nothing occurred in the atmosphere to obstruct their progress, would ascend into
the air without commotion; but when intervening clouds prevent their free
ascent, a conflict arises, from which the thunders are produced. It is similar
with respect to the godly who desire to lift up their hearts to God. If they
would resign themselves to the vain imaginations which arise in their minds,
they might enjoy a sort of unrestrained liberty to indulge in every fancy; but
because they endeavor to resist their influence, and seek to devote themselves
to God, obstructions which arise from the opposition of the flesh begin to
trouble them. Whenever, therefore, the flesh shall put forth its efforts, and
shall kindle up a fire in our hearts, let us know that we are exercised with the
same kind of temptation which occasioned so much pain and trouble to David. In
the end of the verse he acknowledges that the severity of the affliction with
which he was visited had at length overcome him, and that he allowed foolish and
unadvised words to pass from his lips. In his own person he sets before us a
mirror of human infirmity, that, being warned by the danger to which we are
exposed, we may learn betimes to seek protection under the shadow of God's
wings. When he says that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he spake
with his tongue,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>it is not a superfluous
mode of expression, but a true and fuller confession of his sin, in that he had
not only given way to sinful murmuring, but had even uttered loud
complaints.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
39:4-6	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4</b>. O Jehovah! cause me to

David was transported by an improper and sinful excess of passion, seeing he
finds fault with God. This will appear still more clearly from the following
verses. It is true, indeed, that in what follows he introduces pious and
becoming prayers, but here he complains, that, being a mortal man, whose life is
frail and transitory, he is not treated more mildly by God. Of this, and similar
complaints, the discourses of Job are almost full. It is, therefore, not without
anger and resentment that David speaks in this manner: "O God, since thou art
acting with so much severity towards me, at least make me to know how long thou
hast appointed me to live. But is it so, that my life is but a moment, why then
dost thou act with so great rigour? and why dost thou accumulate upon my head
such a load of miseries, as if I had yet many ages to live? What does it profit
me to have been born, if I must pass the period of my existence, which is so
brief, in misery, and oppressed with a continued succession of
calamities?"</font><br><font face="Palatino">Accordingly, this verse should be
read in connection with the following one.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, thou hast made my days as
a hand-breadth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>A hand-breadth is the
measure of four fingers, and is here taken for a very small measure; as if it
had been said, the life of man flies swiftly away, and the end of it, as it
were, touches the beginning. Hence the Psalmist concludes that all men are only
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>vanity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>before God. As to the meaning of the words, he does not ask that the brevity
of human life should be shown to him, as if he knew it not. There is in this
language a kind of irony, as if he had said, Let us count the number of the
years which still remain to me on earth, and will they be a sufficient
recompense for the miseries which I endure? Some render the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ldj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chedel, mundane; </i>and others <i>temporal, </i>that is to say, that which
endures only for a time. But the latter rendering is not appropriate in this
place: for David does not as yet expressly declare the shortness of his life,
but continues to speak on that subject ambiguously. If the word <i>mundane
</i>is adopted, the sense will be, Show me whether thou wilt prolong my life to
the end of the world. But in my judgment, the translation which I have followed
is much more appropriate; and, besides, there may have been a transposition of
the letters
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">d</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>daleth, </i>and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lamed, </i>making the word <i>chedel </i>for <i>cheled. </i>It may, however,
very properly be taken for an age or period of
life.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb66</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> When he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his age is, as it were, nothing
before God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>in order to excite God so
much the more to pity and compassion, he appeals to him as a witness of his
frailty, intimating, that it is not a thing unknown to him how transitory and
passing the life of man is. The expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wholly</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>or </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>altogether
vanity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb67</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>implies that among the whole
human race there is nothing but vanity. He declares this of men, even whilst
<i>they are standing;</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb68</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that is to say, when, being in the prime
and vigor of life, they wish to be held in estimation, and seem to themselves to
be men possessed of considerable influence and power. It was the pangs of sorrow
which forced David to give utterance to these complaints; but it is to be
observed, that it is chiefly when men are sore oppressed by adversity that they
are made to feel their nothingness in the sight of God. Prosperity so
intoxicates them, that, forgetful of their condition, and sunk in insensibility,
they dream of an immortal state on earth. It is very profitable for us to know
our own frailty, but we must beware lest, on account of it, we fall into such a
state of sorrow as may lead us to murmur and repine. David speaks truly and
wisely in declaring, that man, even when he seems to have risen to the highest
state of greatness, is only like the bubble which rises upon the water, blown up
by the wind; but he is in fault when he takes occasion from this to complain of
God. Let us, therefore, so feel the misery of our present condition, as that,
however cast down and afflicted, we may, as humble suppliants, lift up our eyes
to God, and implore his mercy. This we find David does a little after, having
corrected himself; for he does not continue to indulge in rash and inconsiderate
lamentations, but lifting up his soul in the exercise of faith, he attains
heavenly consolation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.<i>

<div><font face="Palatino">Thus he denies that there is any thing abiding in
men, because the appearance of strength which displays itself in them for a time
soon passes away. What he adds, that men
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>disquiet themselves in
vain,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>shows the very height of their
vanity; as if he had said, It seems as if men were born for the very purpose of
rendering themselves more and more contemptible: for although they are only as a
shadow, yet as if they were fools, or rather insane, they involve themselves
needlessly in harassing cares, and vexing themselves to no purpose. He expresses
still more plainly how they manifest their folly, when he declares that while
they anxiously and carefully heap up riches, they never think that they must
soon, and it may be suddenly, leave their present abode. And why is it that they
thus fret away their mind and body, but only because they imagine that they can
never have enough? for by their insatiable desire of gain, they eagerly grasp at
all the riches of the world, as if they had to live a hundred times the life of
man. Moreover, David does not in this passage hold up to scorn the covetousness
of man in the same sense in which Solomon does,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;210510&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ecclesiastes
5:10; for he not only speaks of their heirs, but declares generally, that men
disquiet and vex themselves with care, although they know not who shall reap the
fruit of their labor in amassing
riches.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb71</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> They may indeed wish to make provision
for themselves; but what madness and folly is it for them to torment themselves
with incessant and unprofitable cares which have no certain object or limit?
David here condemns those ardent and unbridled desires, under the influence of
which worldly men are carried away, and talk in a strange manner, confounding
heaven and earth; for they admit not that they are mortal, much less do they
consider that their life is bounded by the narrow limits of a hand-breadth.
David spoke under the influence of a distempered and troubled state of mind; but
there is included in his language this very profitable lesson, that there is no
remedy better fitted for enabling us to rise above all unnecessary cares, than
the recollection that the brief period of our life is only, as it were, a
hand-breadth.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

heart had been too much under the influence of ardent and impetuous emotion,
from which he had experienced great disquietude, now returns to a calm and
settled state of mind; and from this what I have before stated is rendered still
more obvious, namely, that this psalm consists partly of appropriate prayers and
partly of inconsiderate complaints. I have said that David here begins to pray
aright. It is true, that even worldly men sometimes feel in the very same way in
which David here acknowledges that he felt; but the knowledge of their own
vanity does not lead them so far as to seek substantial support in God. On the
contrary, they rather wilfully render themselves insensible, that they may
indulge undisturbed in their own vanity. We may learn from this passage, that no
man looks to God for the purpose of depending upon him, and resting his hope in
him, until he is made to feel his own frailty, yea, and even brought to nought.
There is tacitly great force in the adverb
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>now</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>as if David had said, The flattery and vain imaginations by which the minds
of men are held fast in the sleep of security no longer deceive me, but I am now
fully sensible of my condition. But we must go beyond this elementary stage; for
it is not enough, that, being aroused by a sense of our infirmity, we should
seek with fear and trembling to know our duty, unless at the same time God
manifest himself to us, on whom alone all our expectation should depend.
Accordingly, as it serves no end for worldly men to be convinced of their utter
vanity, because, although convinced of this, they never improve by it, let us
learn to press forward and make still further progress, in order that, being as
it were dead, we may be quickened by God, whose peculiar office it is to create
all things out of nothing; for man then ceases to be vanity, and begins to be
truly something, when, aided by the power of God, he aspires to heavenly
things.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Deliver me from all my
sins. </i></font><font face="Palatino">In this verse the Psalmist still
continues his godly and holy prayer. He is now no longer carried away by the
violence of his grief to murmur against God, but, humbly acknowledging himself
guilty before God, he has recourse to his mercy. In asking to be delivered from
his transgressions, he ascribes the praise of righteousness to God, while he
charges upon himself the blame of all the misery which he endures; and he blames
himself, not only on account of one sin, but acknowledges that he is justly
chargeable with manifold transgressions. By this rule we must be guided, if we
would wish to obtain an alleviation of our miseries; for, until the very source
of them has been dried up, they will never cease to follow one another in rapid
succession. David unquestionably wished an alleviation of his miseries, but, as
he expected that, as soon as he should be reconciled to God, the chastisement of
his sins would also cease, he only here asks that his sins may be forgiven him.
We are thus taught by the example of David, not merely to seek deliverance from
the miseries which afflict and trouble us, but to trace them to their cause and
source, entreating God that he would not lay our sins to our charge, but blot
out our guilt. What follows concerning the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>reproach</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>or </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>scorn of the
foolish</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>may be understood in an active
as well as a passive signification, denoting, either that God would not abandon
him to the mockery of the wicked, or that he would not involve him in the same
disgrace to which the ungodly are given over. As, however, either of these
senses will agree very well with the design of the Psalmist, I leave it to the
reader to adopt the one which he prefers. Besides, the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lbn</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
nabal, </i>signifies not only a foolish person, but also a contemptible man, one
who is utterly worthless and base. It is at least certain, that by this word the
reprobate, whom the Scriptures condemn for their folly, are intended; because,
being deprived of their reason and understanding, they break forth into every
excess in contemning and reproaching
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I was
dumb</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here David blames himself, because
he had not preserved that silence which, as we have already seen, the violence
of his grief forced him to break. When he says then that he was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dumb</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he does not mean this as a commendation of the uniform and persevering
restraint which he had exercised over himself. It is rather a correction of his
error, as if reproving his own impatience, he had spoken within himself in this
way: What doest thou? thou hadst enjoined upon thyself silence, and now thou
murmurest proudly against God; what wilt thou gain by this presumption? We have
here a very profitable and instructive lesson; for nothing is better fitted to
restrain the violent paroxysms of grief, than the recollection that we have to
do, not with a mortal man, but with God, who will always maintain his own
righteousness in opposition to all that men may say against it in their
murmuring complaints, and even in their outrageous accusations. What is the
reason why the great majority of men run to such excess in their impatience, but
because they forget that, in doing so, they dare to plead a controversy with
God? Thus, while some impute all their miseries to fortune, and others to men,
and others account for them from a variety of causes which their own fancy
suggests, while scarcely one in a hundred recognises in them the hand of God,
they allow themselves to indulge in bitter complaint, without ever thinking that
in so doing they offend God. David, on the contrary, in order to subdue every
unholy desire and sinful excess, returns to God, and resolves to keep silence,
because the affliction which he is now suffering proceeded from God. As David,
who was thus afflicted with the severest trials, resolved nevertheless to keep
silence, let us learn from this, that it is one of the chief exercises of our
faith to humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God, and to submit to his
judgments without murmuring or complaint. It is to be observed, that men humbly
and calmly submit themselves to God only when they are persuaded, not only that
he does by his almighty power whatever he pleases, but that he is also a
righteous Judge; for although the wicked feel that the hand of God is upon them,
yet as they charge him with cruelty and tyranny, they cease not to pour forth
horrible blasphemies against him. In the meantime, David regards the secret
judgments of God with such reverence and wonder, that, satisfied with his will
alone, he considers it sinful to open his mouth to utter a single word against
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
39:10-11	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b>. Take away thy stroke
from me: I have failed [or fainted] by the blow of thy hand. <b>11</b>. Thou

Selah.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10<i>.</i>
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take away thy stroke from
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David here confirms the prayer which
he had already presented, namely, that having obtained pardon from God, he
might, at the same time, be gently dealt with by him. This prayer, however, does
not disturb the silence of which he had just made mention; for our desires and
prayers, if they are framed according to the rule of God's word, are not
inconsiderate and noisy so as to provoke the divine displeasure against us, but
proceed from the calm stillness which faith and patience produce in our hearts.
It is indeed true, that when any one prays earnestly to God, he cannot fail to
mix up with it his own feelings, pour forth his complaints, and manifest an
extreme ardor. But we see that David, who formerly bewailed his miseries in loud
lamentations, now sets himself calmly to consider and weigh what he merited, and
prays for pardon. His meaning is, that God would mitigate the punishment which
he had inflicted upon him. The reason immediately follows; for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have fainted by the blow of thy
hand.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In thus speaking, David does not
allege this as an excuse to extenuate his fault, but desires that he may be
borne with in his infirmity. As he says with respect to himself individually,
that he is consumed, because he feels that the hand of God is against him, so he
immediately states in the 11th verse the same truth in general terms, telling
us, that if God should begin to deal with us according to the strict demands of
the law, the consequence would be, that all would perish, and be utterly
overwhelmed under his wrath. He plainly shows, first, that he is speaking not of
any one man, or even of men generally, for he makes use of a Hebrew word, which
denotes a man renowned for his valor, courage, or
excellence;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb74</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and then, secondly, he says, that if God
should set himself to chastise such persons, every thing which they esteem
precious in themselves would consume away or be dissolved. The sum is, that
among men there is no one endued with such power and glory whom the wrath of
God, if it burn fiercely against him, will not forthwith bring to nothing. But
it will be necessary to examine the words more minutely. David does not simply
describe the dreadful character of God's wrath; but at the same time he declares
and sets forth his righteousness in all the punishments which he inflicts upon
men. The judgments of God sometimes strike fear and dread into the hearts even
of heathen men, but their blindness fills them with such rage, that they still
continue to fight against God. By the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rebukes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>David means severe punishments, such as are the tokens of strict justice and
signs of divine wrath. We know that God often exercises the rod of his
chastisement upon true believers, but he does it in such a manner as that in
punishing them he at the same time gives them a taste of his mercy and his love,
and not only tempers the chastisements with which he visits them, but also
mingles them with comfort, which serves to render them much more tolerable.
David, then, is not speaking in this place of fatherly chastisement, but of the
punishment which God inflicts upon the reprobate, when, like an inexorable judge
in the exercise of his office, he executes against them the judgment which they
have merited. He tells us that when God makes this rigour to be felt, there is
no man who does not forthwith consume or pine away. At first view the comparison
of God to a moth may seem absurd; for what relation is there, it may be said,
between a small moth-worm and the infinite majesty of God? I answer, That David
has with much propriety made use of this simile, that we may know that although
God does not openly thunder from heaven against the reprobate, yet his secret
curse ceases not to consume them away, just as the moth, though unperceived,
wastes by its secret gnawing a piece of cloth or
wood.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon"> fb75
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">At the same time, he alludes to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
excellency</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb76</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of man, which he says is
destroyed as it were by corruption, when God is offended, even as the moth
destroys the most precious cloths by wasting them. The Scriptures often very
appropriately employ various similitudes in this Way, and are wont to apply them
sometimes in one view and sometimes in another. When Hezekiah
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233813&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
38:13) compares God to a lion, he does so in reference to the feelings of his
own mind, because he was so prostrated and overwhelmed with fear and terror. But
in this place David teaches us, that although the world may not perceive the
dreadful vengeance of God, yet it consumes the reprobate by secretly gnawing
them. This sentence, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that every
man is vanity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is again very properly
repeated; for until we are overcome by the power of God, and as it were humbled
in the dust, we never search into our own hearts, that the knowledge of our own
vanity may divest us of all presumption. Whence is it that men are so foolishly
satisfied with themselves, yea, and even applaud themselves, unless it be that,
so long as God bears with them, they are wilfully blind to their own
infirmities? The only remedy, then, by which men are cured of pride is when,
alarmed with a sense of God's wrath, they begin not only to be dissatisfied with
themselves, but also to humble themselves even to the
dust.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

the style, or to express the same thing in different language. This shows that
David bewailed his condition sincerely, and from the bottom of his heart; and in
this he has given us, by his own example, a rule for prayer. When he calls
himself a

</i>and a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sojourner</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>not only because men are absent
from God so long as they dwell in this world, but in the same sense in which he
formerly said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My days are before
thee as nothing;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is to say, God,
without standing in need of any one to inform him, knows well enough that men
have only a short journey to perform in this world, the end of which is soon
reached, or that they remain only a short time in it, as those who are lodged in
a house for pay.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb78</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The purport of the Psalmist's discourse
is, that God sees from heaven how miserable our condition would be, if he did
not sustain us by his mercy.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13<i>.</i>
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let me alone, that I may

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cease from

there be a wall raised betwixt us, that thy hand may not reach me. Others read,
as a supplement, the word <i>eyes; </i>but as to the sense, it matters little
which of the expositions be adopted, for the meaning is the same, That David
entreats God to grant him a little relaxation from his trouble, that he might
recover strength, or, at least, enjoy a short respite, before he depart from
this world. This concluding verse of the psalm relates to the disquietude and
sinful emotions which he had experienced according to the flesh; for he seems in
the way of complaining of God, to ask that at least time might be granted him to
die, as men are wont to speak who are grievously harassed by their affliction. I
admit, that he speaks in a becoming manner, in acknowledging that there is no
hope of his being restored to health, until God cease to manifest his
displeasure; but he errs in this, that he asks a respite, just that he may have
time to die. We might, indeed, regard the prayer as allowable, by understanding
it in this sense:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>as it will not be possible for me to endure thy stroke any longer, but I
must, indeed, miserably perish, if thou continuest to afflict me severely, at
least grant me relief for a little season, that in calmness and peace I may
commit my soul into thy hands. But we may easily infer, from the language which
he employs, that his mind was so affected with the bitterness of his grief that
he could not present a prayer pure and well seasoned with the sweetness of
faith; for he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before I
depart, and be no more:</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>a form of speech
which indicates the feeling almost of despair. Not that David could regard death
as the entire annihilation of man, or that, renouncing all hope of his
salvation, he resigned himself to destruction; but he employs this language,
because he had previously been so much depressed by reason of grief, that he
could not lift up his heart with so much cheerfulness as it behoved him. This is
a mode of expression which is to be found more than once in the complaints of
Job. It is obvious, therefore, that, although David endeavored carefully to
restrain the desires of the flesh, yet these occasioned him so much disquietude
and trouble, that they forced him to exceed the proper limits in his
grief.</font><br></div>

40</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">David, being delivered from some great danger, and it
may be, not from one only, but from many, extols very highly the grace of God,
and by means of this, his soul is filled with admiration of the providence of
God, which extends itself to the whole human race. Then he protests that he will
give himself wholly to the service of God, and defines briefly in what manner
God is to be served and honored. Afterwards, he again returns to the exercise of
thanksgiving, and celebrates the praises of the Eternal by rehearsing many of
his glorious and powerful deeds. Lastly, when he has complained of his enemies,
he concludes the psalm with a new prayer.</font><br></div>

</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In waiting I
waited</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The beginning of this psalm is
an expression of thanksgiving, in which David relates that he had been
delivered, not only from danger, but also from present death. Some are of
opinion, but without good reason, that it ought to be understood of sickness. It
is rather to be supposed that David here comprehends a multitude of dangers from
which he had escaped. He had certainly been more than once exposed to the
greatest danger, even of death, so that, with good reason, he might be said to
have been swallowed up in the gulf of death, and sunk in the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>miry
clay</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It, nevertheless, appears that his
faith had still continued firm, for he ceased not to trust in God, although the
long continuance of the calamity had well nigh exhausted his patience. He tells
us, not merely that he had waited, but by the repetition of the same expression,
he shows that he had been a long time in anxious suspense. In proportion then as
his trial was prolonged, the evidence and proof of his faith in enduring the
delay with calmness and equanimity of mind was so much the more apparent. The
meaning in short is, that although God delayed his help, yet the heart of David
did not faint, or grow weary from delay; but that after he had given, as it
were, sufficient proof of his patience, he was at length heard. In his example
there is set before us this very useful doctrine, that although God may not
forthwith appear for our help, but rather of design keep us in suspense and
perplexity, yet we must not lose courage, inasmuch as faith is not thoroughly
tried, except by long endurance. The result, too, of which he speaks in terms of
praise, ought to inspire us with increased fortitude. God may succor us more
slowly than we desire, but, when he seems to take no notice of our condition,
or, if we might so speak, when he seems to be inactive or to sleep, this is
totally different from deceit: for if we are enabled by the invincible strength
and power of faith to endure, the fitting season of our deliverance will at
length
arrive.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>

similitude of <i>the </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>miry
clay</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>by which he intimates that he had
been so nearly overwhelmed by the weight of his calamities, that it was no easy
matter to extricate him from them. Next, there follows a sudden and incredible
change, by which he makes manifest to all the greatness of the grace which had
been bestowed upon him. He declares that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his feet were set upon a
rock</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>whereas formerly he had been
overwhelmed with water; and that his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>steps were

</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he hath put into my

the verse he concludes the description of what God had done for him. By God's
putting </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a new song into his
mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he denotes the consummation of his
deliverance. In whatever way God is pleased to succor us, he asks nothing else
from us in return but that we should be thankful for and remember it. As often,
therefore, as he bestows benefits upon us, so often does he open our mouths to
praise his name. Since God, by acting liberally towards us, encourages us to
sing his praises, David with good reason reckons, that having been so
wonderfully delivered, the matter of a new song had been furnished to him. He
uses the word <i>new </i>in the sense of exquisite and not ordinary, even as the
manner of his deliverance was singular and worthy of everlasting remembrance. It
is true, that there is no benefit of God so small that it ought not to call
forth our highest praises; but the more mightily he stretches forth his hand to
help us, the more does it become us to stir up ourselves to fervent zeal in this
holy exercise, so that our songs may correspond to the greatness of the favor
which has been conferred upon
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Many shall see
it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here the Psalmist extends still
farther the fruit of the aid which he had experienced, telling us, that it will
prove the means of instruction common to all. And certainly it is the will of
God that the benefits which he bestows upon any individual of the faithful
should be proofs of the goodness which he constantly exercises towards all of
them, so that the one, instructed by the example of the other, should not doubt
that the same grace will be manifested towards himself. The terms
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hope</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>trust</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>do not seem at first view to harmonise; but David has not improperly joined
them together; for no man will ever entertain the hope of the favor of God but
he whose mind is first imbued with the fear of God. I understand
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>in general to mean the feeling of piety which is produced in us by the
knowledge of the power, equity, and mercy of God. The judgment which God
executed against the enemies of David served, it is true, to inspire all men
with fear; but, in my opinion, David rather means, that by the deliverance which
he had obtained, many would be induced to yield themselves to the service of
God, and to submit with all reverence to his authority, because they would know
him to be the Judge of the world. Now, whoever submits cordially to the will of
God will of necessity join hope with fear; especially when there is presented to
his view the evidence of the grace by which God commonly allures all men to
himself; for I have already said that God is presented to our view as merciful
and kind to others, that we may assure ourselves that he will be the same
towards us. As to the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>see</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>of which David makes use, we are to understand it as referring not only to
the eyes, but chiefly to the perception of the mind. All without distinction saw
what had happened, but to many of them it never occurred to recognize the
deliverance of David as the work of God. Since, then, so many are blind
regarding the works of God, let us learn, that those only are considered to see
clearly to whom the Spirit of understanding has been given, that they may not
occupy their minds in dwelling upon the mere events which take place, but may
discern in them by faith the secret hand of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i>David here relates what ground for good hope his deliverance would give to
all the faithful; inasmuch as, setting aside all the allurements of the world,
they would thereby be encouraged to commit themselves with confidence to the
protection of God; persuaded not only that they are happy who trust in him
alone, but that all other expectations at variance with this are deceitful and
cursed. This assurance is not natural to us, but is derived partly from the word
of God, and partly from his works; although, as I have said before, the
contemplation alone of the works of God would not kindle this light within us,
unless God, illuminating us by his word, should show us his benevolence. After
having promised to be gracious to us, in manifesting also his goodness by
indubitable proofs, he confirms with his own hand what he had previously uttered
with his lips. David, therefore, from the fact of his having been restored to
life from the abyss of death, justly declares that the faithful are taught from
this proof &#8212; what men are naturally so reluctant to believe &#8212; that
they are happy who trust in God alone.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As the
instability of our nature commonly tends to draw us downward, and as all of us,
from our proneness to yield to delusions, are tempted by many wicked examples,
David immediately adds, that he is blessed
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who regardeth not the
proud</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some, indeed, render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ybhr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rehabim, the rich, </i>or <i>the great of this world, </i>but improperly, in
my opinion; because <i>pride, </i>and <i>turning aside to lies, </i>are two
things which David here joins together.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To regard the great of the
earth,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>therefore, does not signify, as
they suppose, to rely upon their power and riches, as if a man's welfare
depended thereupon, but it rather means to be carried away by their examples, to
imitate their conduct. When we are everywhere constantly seeing men puffed up
with pride, who despise God, and place their highest felicity in ambition, in
fraud, in extortion, in guile, a perverse desire of imitating them steals upon
us by degrees; and, especially when every thing turns out according to their
wishes, a vain and delusive expectation solicits us to try the same course.
David, therefore, wisely, and not without good reason, warns us, that in order
to have our mind constantly fixed in simple reliance upon God alone, we must
guard against those evil examples which ever seek to allure us on all sides to
apostatise from him. Moreover, when he says that the proud
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>turn aside to
lying</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>vanity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb84</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>in this way he describes briefly
the foolish confidence of the flesh. What else is the pride of those who put
their own fancies in the place of God but a vain illusion? Certainly the man
who, puffed up by the breath of fond conceit, arrogates any thing in the least
degree to himself, flatters himself to his own destruction. In short, pride and
vanity are opposed to the holy confidence which relies upon God alone; for there
is nothing more difficult to the flesh than to trust in God alone, and the world
is always full of proud and haughty men, who, soothing themselves with vain
allurements, would soon corrupt the minds of the godly, if this arrest were not
laid upon them, to restrain, as with a bridle, their erroneous and extravagant
opinions.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.<i>

</i>Interpreters are not entirely agreed as to these words; but it is generally
admitted that David here contemplates with admiration the providence of God in
the government of mankind. And first of all, he exclaims that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wonders of God's works are great
or
many</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb85</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>meaning by this, that God in his
inscrutable wisdom so governs human affairs, that his works, which come to be
little thought of by men, from their constant familiarity with them, far surpass
the comprehension of the human understanding. Thus we find, that from one
particular species he ascends to the whole class; as if he had said, God has
proved not only by this particular act the paternal care which he exercises
towards men, but that, in general, his wonderful providence shines forth in the
several parts of creation. Then he adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the counsels of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>concerning us are so high and so
hidden, that it is impossible to reckon them up in order distinctly and
agreeably to their nature. Some think that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wnyla</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>elenu, </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>towards
us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is employed by way of comparison, in
this sense, The counsels of God are far beyond the reach of our understanding,
(but David rather commends the care which God vouchsafes to take of us;) and as,
in this way, the connection of the words is broken, they are constrained to
render the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dwr[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aroch, </i>which I have rendered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to count in
order</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>differently, namely, that none is
equal to God, or can be compared with
him.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb86</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But that I may not enter upon any
lengthened refutation, the intelligent reader will agree with me in considering
that the true meaning is this: That God, by his incomprehensible wisdom, governs
the world in such a manner that we cannot reckon up his works in their proper
order, seeing our minds, through their very dulness, fail us before we can reach
to so great a height. It follows, <i>to thee, </i>for although we should in so
far reflect how wonderfully the Lord can make provision for our wants, yet this
consideration is limited by the imperfection of our understanding: and hence it
falls far short of the infinite glory of God. Those who give this explanation,
that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the counsels of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>are not referred to him, because the
greatest part of men imagine that every thing is subject to chance and fortune,
as if David meant in passing to censure the ingratitude of those who defraud God
of his praise, are no doubt mistaken as to the meaning. In stating, as David
does, immediately after, that however much he might set himself to rehearse the
works of God, he yet would fail ere he could declare the half of them; &#8212;
in stating this he shows with sufficient plainness that the godly and devout
meditation, in which the children of God are often engaged, gives them only, as
it were, a slight taste of them and nothing more. We have now arrived then at
the Psalmist's meaning. Having spoken before of the deliverance which God had
vouchsafed to him, he takes occasion from it to set forth the general providence
of God in nourishing and sustaining men. It is also his design in this to exhort
the faithful to a consideration of God's providence, that they may not hesitate
to cast all their cares upon it. Whilst some are in constant pain by reason of
their own anxiety and discontent, or quake at the slightest breeze that blows,
and others labor hard to fortify and preserve their life by means of earthly
succours, &#8212; all this proceeds from ignorance of the doctrine, that God
governs the affairs of this world according to his own good pleasure. And as the
great majority of men, measuring the providence of God by their own
understanding, wickedly obscure or degrade it, David, placing it on its proper
footing, wisely removes this impediment. The meaning of the sentence, therefore,
amounts to this, that in the works of God men should reverently admire what they
cannot comprehend by their reason; and whenever the flesh moves them to
contradiction or murmuring, they should raise themselves above the world. If God
cease to work, he seems to be asleep, because, binding up his hands to the use
of outward means, we do not consider that he works by means which are secret. We
may therefore learn from this place, that although the reason of his works may
be hidden or unknown to us, he is nevertheless wonderful in his
counsels.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This verse is closely connected with
the preceding. No man places, as he ought, entire trust in God, but he who,
shutting his eyes upon external circumstances, suffers himself to be governed by
him according to his good pleasure. Moreover, having spoken hitherto in the
third person, David now suddenly addresses his discourse, not, however,
unadvisedly, to God, that he might lead us the more effectually to this sobriety
and discretion. When, however, he affirms that the works of God cannot be
distinctly known by us, it is not for the purpose of deterring us from seeking
the knowledge of them, or from the examination of them, but only to lay a
restraint upon our rashness, which would otherwise go beyond the proper
boundaries in this respect. To this end, the words
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>are expressly employed, by which
we are admonished that however diligently a man may set himself to meditate upon
the works of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he can only attain to the extremities or borders of them. Although then so
great a height be far above our reach, we must, notwithstanding, endeavor, as
much as in us lies, to approach it more and more by continual advances; as we
see also the hand of God stretched forth to disclose to us, so far as it is
expedient, those wonders, which we are unable of ourselves to discover. There is
nothing so preposterous as to affect, of one's own accord, a gross ignorance of
the providence of God, because as yet we cannot comprehend it perfectly, but
only discern it in part; even as at this day we find some who employ all their
endeavors to bury it in oblivion, for no other pretense than that it surpasses
our understanding, as if it were unreasonable to allow to God anything more than
what appears right and proper, according to our carnal reason. David acts very
differently regarding it. Feeling all his senses absorbed by an inconceivable
majesty and brightness, which he could not bear to look
upon,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb87</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he confesses frankly that these are
wonderful things of which he could not comprehend the reason; but still he does
not abstain wholly and everywhere from making mention of them, but, according to
the measure of his capacity, sets himself devoutly to meditate upon them. From
this we learn how foolish and vain a thing it is to say, by way of caution, that
none should speak of the counsels or purposes of God, because they are high and
incomprehensible. David, on the contrary, though he was ready to sink under the
weight, ceased not to contemplate them, and abstained not from speaking of them,
because he felt unequal to the task of rehearsing them, but was content, after
having declared his faith on this subject, to finish his discourse in
admiration.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></b><i>In sacrifice and oblation thou hast not taken

sacrifice of praise, or, as the prophet Hosea calls it,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;281402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
14:2,) "the<i> </i>calves of the lips," but, in token of his gratitude, offers
and consecrates himself entirely to God; as if he had said, I am now wholly
devoted to God, because, having been delivered by his wonderful power, I am
doubly indebted to him for my life. At the same time, treating of the true
worship of God, he shows that it consists not in outward ceremonies, but rather
that it is spiritual. Accordingly, the meaning is, that he came into the
presence of God not only in the outward pomp or ceremony and figures of the law,
but that he brought with him the true devotion of the heart. We know, indeed,
that all men have some sense of religion impressed upon their hearts, so that no
one dares to withdraw openly and wholly from his service, and yet the greater
part of men turn aside into winding and crooked paths; and hence it happens,
that in serving God in a perfunctory manner, their worship is scarcely anything
else than a mockery of him. We see then the reason why David, on the present
occasion, shows in what the true worship of God consists; it is, that he may
distinguish between himself and hypocrites, who draw near to God with their lips
only, or at least seek to pacify him with cold and unmeaning
ceremonies.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We now come to the exposition of the
words. I have no doubt that David, under the four different kinds of sacrifices
which he here enumerates, comprehends all the sacrifices of the law. His
meaning, to express it in a few words, is, that God requires not mere ceremonies
of those who serve him, but that he is satisfied only with sincerity of heart,
with faith and holiness of life: and that he takes no pleasure merely in the
visible sanctuary, the altar, the burning of incense, the killing of beasts, the
lights, the costly apparel, and outward washings. From this he concludes, that
he ought to be guided by another principle, and to observe another rule in the
service of God, than a mere attention to these &#8212; that he should yield
himself wholly to God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou
hast bored my ears.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some think that in
using this form of expression, David has a reference to the ordinance under the
Law of which we read in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;022106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
21:6. If any bond-servant, when the time of his being discharged from servitude
had arrived, made no account of his freedom, he was brought to the public place
of judgment, and having there declared that he wished to continue in servitude,
his master pierced his ear with an awl, as a mark of perpetual bondage. But this
mode of interpretation appears to be too forced and
refined.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb88</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Others more simply consider that it is
of the same meaning as to render fit, or qualify for service, for David mentions
not one ear only, but both. Men, we know, are naturally deaf, because they are
so dull, that their ears are stopped until God pierce them. By this expression,
therefore, is denoted the docility to which we are brought and moulded by the
grace of the Holy Spirit. I, however, apply this manner of expression more
closely to the scope of the passage before us, and explain it in this sense,
That David was not slow and dull of hearing, as men usually are, so that he
could discern nothing but what was earthly in the sacrifices, but that his ears
had been cleansed, so that he was a better interpreter of the Law, and able to
refer all the outward ceremonies to the spiritual service of God. He encloses
the sentence, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast bored my
ears,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as it were, in parenthesis, whilst
he is treating professedly of sacrifices, so that the sentence might be
explained in this way: Lord, thou hast opened my ears, that I may distinctly
understand whatever thou hast commanded concerning the sacrifices, namely, that
of themselves they afford thee no pleasure: for thou, who art a Spirit, takest
no delight in these earthly elements, and hast no need of flesh or blood; and,
therefore, thou requirest something of a higher and more excellent nature. If,
however, it is objected that sacrifices were offered by the express commandment
of God, I have just said that David here distinguishes between the spiritual
service of God, and that which consisted in outward types and shadows. And in
making this comparison, it is no great wonder to find him saying that the
sacrifices are of no value, since they were only helps designed to lead men to
true piety, and tended to a far higher end than that which was at first
apparent. Seeing, then, God made use of these elements, only to lead his people
to the exercises of faith and repentance, we conclude that he had no delight in
being worshipped by sacrifices. We must always bear in mind, that whatever is
not pleasing to God for its own sake, but only in so far as it leads to some
other end, if it be put in the place of his true worship and service is rejected
and cast away by
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>Then said I, Lo! I come.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By
the adverb <i>then </i>he intimates, that he had not been a good scholar, and
capable of profiting by instruction, until God had opened his ears; but as soon
as he had been instructed by the secret inspirations of the Spirit, he tells us,
that then his heart was ready to yield a willing and cheerful obedience. Here
true obedience is very properly distinguished from a constrained and slavish
subjection. Whatever service, therefore, men may offer to God, it is vain and
offensive in his sight, unless at the same time they offer themselves; and,
moreover, this offering of one's self is of no value unless it be done
willingly. These words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lo! I
come,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>ought to be observed, and likewise
the words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have delighted to do
thy will;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ytxpj</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
chaphatsti, </i>means, I was well pleased, or, I willingly condescended. Here
David indicates his readiness to yield obedience, as well as the cordial
affection of his heart and persevering resolution. His language implies, that he
cordially preferred the service of God to every other desire and care, and had
not only yielded a willing subjection, but also embraced the rule of a pious and
holy life, with a fixed and steady purpose of adhering to it. This he confirms
still further in the third clause of the verse, in which he says, that <i>the
Law of God </i>was deeply fixed
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the midst of his
bowels</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb89</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It follows from this, first, that
however beautiful and splendid the works of men may appear, yet unless they
spring from the living root of the heart, they are nothing better than a mere
pretense; and, secondly, that it is to no purpose that the feet, and hands, and
eyes, are framed for keeping the Law, unless obedience begin at the heart.
Moreover, it appears from other places of Scripture, that it is the peculiar
office of the Holy Spirit to engrave the Law of God on our hearts. God, it is
true, does not perform his work in us as if we were stones or stocks, drawing us
to himself without the feeling or inward moving of our hearts towards him. But
as there is in us naturally a will, which, however, is depraved by the
corruption of our nature, so that it always inclines us to sin, God changes it
for the better, and thus leads us cordially to seek after righteousness, to
which our hearts were previously altogether averse. Hence arises that true
freedom which we obtain when God frames our hearts, which before were in
thraldom to sin, unto obedience to
himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the roll of the

fb90</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>some have been inclined to

the etymology of the word

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a
roll</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is necessary to ascertain in
what sense David claims peculiarly to himself what is common or alike to all
men. Since the Law prescribes to all men the rule of a holy and upright life, it
does not appear, it may be said, that what is here stated pertains to any one
man or any set of men. I answer, that although the literal doctrine of the Law
belongs to all men in common, yet as of itself it is dead, and only beats the
air, God teaches his own people after another manner; and that, as the inward
and effectual teaching of the Spirit is a treasure which belongs peculiarly to
them, it is written of them only in the secret book of God, that they should
fulfill his will. The voice of God, indeed, resounds throughout the whole world,
so that all who do not obey it are rendered inexcusable; but it penetrates into
the hearts of the godly alone, for whose salvation it is ordained. As a general,
therefore, enrols the names of his soldiers, that he may know their exact
number, and as a schoolmaster writes the names of his scholars in a scroll, so
has God written the names of his children in the book of life, that he may
retain them under the yoke of his own
discipline.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There still remains another
difficulty connected with this passage. The Apostle, in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581005&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
10:5, seems to wrest this place, when he restricts what is spoken of all the
elect to Christ alone, and expressly contends that the sacrifices of the Law,
which David says are not agreeable to God in comparison of the obedience of the
heart, are abrogated; and when quoting rather the words of the
Septuagint,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb92</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> than those of the prophet, he infers
from them more than David intended to teach. As to his restricting this passage
to the person of Christ, the solution is easy. David did not speak in his own
name only, but has shown in general what belongs to all the children of God. But
when bringing into view the whole body of the Church, it was necessary that he
should refer us to the head itself. It is no objection that David soon after
imputes to his own sins the miseries which he endures; for it is by no means an
uncommon thing to find our errors, by a mode of expression not strictly correct,
transferred to Christ. As to the abrogation of the sacrifices that were under
the Law, I answer thus: That their abrogation may be fairly inferred from the
language of the prophets; for this is not like many other places in which God
condemns and rejects the sacrifices which were offered by hypocrites, and which
were deservedly offensive to him on account of their uncleanness: for in these
God condemns the outward ceremony, on account of the abuse and corruption of it,
which rendered it nothing but a vain mockery; whereas here, when the Prophet
speaks of himself as one who worshipped God sincerely, and yet denies that God
had pleasure in these sacrifices, it may easily be inferred, that the rudiments
which God had enjoined upon his ancient people for a time had some other end in
view, and were only like infantile instructions designed to prepare them for
some higher state. But if their truth and substance are contained in Christ, it
is certain that they have been abolished by his coming. They were indeed still
in use in the time of David: and yet he admonishes us that the true service of
God, even when performed without sacrifices, was perfect and complete in all its
parts, and every where; and that the ceremonies are things which might be
regarded as non-essential, and, as we speak, adventitious. This is worthy of
being noticed, that we may know that God, even after he has removed the figures
which he had commanded for a time, does not cease always to resemble himself;
for in these outward services he had respect solely to men. As to this, that the
Apostle, following the Septuagint, has made subservient to his own use the word
<i>body, </i>which is not used here by David, in such an allusion there is no
inconsistency; for he does not undertake expressly to unfold and explain in
every point the Psalmist's meaning: but as he had said, that by the one
sacrifice of Christ all the others had been abolished, he adds at the same time
that a body had been prepared for Christ, that by the offering up of it he might
fulfill the will of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
40:9-11	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9</b>. I have proclaimed thy

</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have proclaimed thy
righteousness in the great assembly.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Here David again brings forward his own thankfulness, and for no other
reason but to induce God to continue his goodness towards him. God, whenever he
manifests his liberality towards us, encourages us to render thanks to him; and
he continues to act in a similar manner towards us when he sees that we are
thankful and mindful of what he has done for us. In the first place, David makes
use simply of the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>but it must be understood of the righteousness of God, which he expressly
mentions soon after. Nor does he say, that it was only in the secret affection
of the heart, or in private, that he offered praise to God, but that he had
openly proclaimed it in the solemn assembly, even as the faithful in those days
were wont to testify their devotion by presenting peace-offerings to God when
they had been delivered from any great danger.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The great
assembly</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of which he speaks is not to be
understood of the concourse of people that assemble at courts of law, or at the
public market-places, but it denotes the true and lawfully constituted Church of
God, which we know assembled in the place of his sanctuary. Accordingly, he
declares that he had not concealed in his heart the righteousness of God, which
it becomes us publicly to make known for the edification of one another. Those
who keep it hid in their hearts are surely seeking as much as in them lies that
the memory of God may be buried in oblivion. He calls upon God as a witness of
this, not only to distinguish between himself and hypocrites, who often proclaim
loudly, and with all their might, the praises of God, and yet do so without the
least spark of affection; but also to make it the more abundantly obvious that
he had sincerely and heartily uttered the praises of God, and was careful not to
defraud him of any part of them. This affirmation teaches us that the subject
which is here treated of is one of no small importance; for although God stands
in no need of our praises, yet it is his will that this exercise for many
reasons should prevail amongst
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10<i>.</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>I have not hidden thy righteousness within my
heart.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here it is necessary to observe
the accumulation of terms which are employed to denote the same thing. To the
righteousness of God the Psalmist adds his truth, his salvation, and his mercy.
And what is the design of this, but to magnify and set forth the goodness of God
by many terms or expressions of praise? We must, however, notice in what
respects these terms differ; for in this way we may be able to ascertain in what
respects they apply to the deliverance of which David here discourses. If these
four things should be taken in their proper order,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mercy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>will hold the first place, as it is that by which alone God is induced to
vouchsafe, to regard us. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His
righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is the protection by which
he constantly defends his own people, and the goodness by which, as we have
already said elsewhere, he preserves them. And, lest any should doubt that it
will flow in a constant and uninterrupted course, David adds in the third place
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>truth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>by which we are taught that God continues always the same, and is never
wearied of helping us, nor at any time withdraws his hand. There is, at the same
time, implied in this an exhibition of the promises; for no man will ever
rightly take hold of the righteousness of God but he who embraces it as it is
offered and held forth in the Word.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is the effect of righteousness, for God continues to manifest his free favor
to his people, daily affording them aid and assistance, until he has completely
saved
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11<i>.</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>O thou Jehovah! withhold not thy tender mercies from
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We now see more clearly, what I have
just adverted to, that David speaks of his own thankfulness, that he might
secure a continuance of God's favor towards him; and that he opened his mouth in
the praises of God, that he might continue to acquire new favors, against which
our perverse and ungrateful silence very often closes the gate. We ought,
therefore, carefully to observe the relation which the clause, in which David
affirms that he closed not his lips, bears to what follows, namely, that God on
his part would not contract or stop up the course of his tender mercies; for by
this we are taught that God would always be ready to relieve us by his goodness,
or rather that it would flow down upon us as from a never-failing fountain, if
our own ingratitude did not prevent or cut off its course. <i>The
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tender
mercies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of God, which he expresses by
the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dymjr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rachamecha, </i>and of which he here speaks, differ little from his goodness.
It was not, however, without cause that David chose to make this distinction. It
could only be, first, because he was unable otherwise to satisfy himself in
extolling the grace of God; and, secondly, because it was requisite to show that
the source from which the mercy and goodness of God proceed, when he is moved in
compassion for our miseries to aid and succor us. Then he places his confidence
of salvation in the goodness and faithfulness of God, for we must of necessity
begin (as I have said a little before) at the free favor of God, that his bounty
may extend even to us. But as we are unable to discern that God is gracious to

<i>avon, </i>which we have rendered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

more than once;) yet we must take into consideration the derivation of the
word.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb95</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Accordingly, since David calls the
afflictions which he endures the fruit or effect of his transgressions, there is
implied in this a humble confession, from which we may ascertain with what
reverence and meekness he submitted to the judgments of God, seeing that, when
overwhelmed with an accumulation of miseries, he sets forth his sins in all
their magnitude and aggravation, lest he should suspect God of undue severity.
When we see David treated so severely, let us also learn, when we are oppressed
with extreme afflictions, and are groaning under them, humbly to implore the
grace and mercy of our Judge. Nor is it his design to show that he had been
stupid or hardened, when he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his heart failed or forsook
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>His language means, that he was not
only broken-hearted, but that he lay as if he had been dead. We must, however,
understand this
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fainting</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>or </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>failing of the
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as referring to the sense of the
flesh; for his perseverance in prayer is a certain proof that his faith was
never altogether extinguished. But since he was, in so far as man was concerned,
destitute of counsel, and was altogether without strength, it is not without
cause that he says that his heart failed
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be thou pleased, O Jehovah!
to deliver me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The verb which David here
makes use of, signifies to desire a thing from pure kindness and
good-will.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb96</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He desires, therefore, to be delivered
by the free mercy of God. As to his desire, that God would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>make
haste</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>we have elsewhere spoken of it.
Even when God delays to help us, it is our duty to contend against a feeling of
weariness; but such is his goodness, that he permits us to use this form of
prayer, That he would make haste according to our desires. Then, according to
his usual practice, citing his enemies to the judgment-seat of God, he feels
confident, that, on account of their cruelty, and unjust and wicked hatred, he
shall obtain what he asks. We must maintain it as a fixed principle, that the
more unjustly our enemies afflict us, and the more cruelly they wrong us, God is
so much the more disposed to give us help. And it is no slight consolation that
the mercy of God strives against their wickedness, so that the more fiercely our
enemies pursue us to effect our hurt, the more ready is he to bring us help. We
have already frequently spoken of the feelings with which David uttered these
imprecations, and it is necessary here again to refresh our memories on the
subject, lest any man, when giving loose reins to his passions, should allege
the example of David in palliation or excuse. This wicked and counterfeit
imitation on the part of those who follow the powerful impulse of the flesh,
instead of being guided by the zeal of the Spirit, is always to be held up to
condemnation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When the Psalmist prays (verse 15)
that his enemies </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>may be destroyed
for a reward of their shame,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>the meaning
is this: As their sole desire has been to overwhelm me with shame, in order
that, while thus dismayed and confounded, they might make me the object of their
derision; so let a similar confusion fall upon their own heads. In the second
clause of the verse he describes the nature of this confusion by relating the
terms of their wicked triumphing, by which they poured contempt upon him while
he was so oppressed with misery and affliction. We are here taught that, when
our enemies shall have persecuted us to the uttermost, a recompense is also
prepared for them; and that God will turn back, and cause to fall upon their own
heads, all the evil which they had devised against us; and this doctrine ought
to act as a restraint upon us, that we may behave ourselves compassionately and
kindly towards our neighbors.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
40:16-17	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16</b>. Let all those that seek
thee be glad and rejoice in thee: and let those that love thy salvation say

hath regarded me; thou art my help and my deliverer: O thou my God! make no
delay.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let all those that seek thee
be glad and rejoice in thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David here
uses another argument &#8212; one which he often adduces elsewhere &#8212; in
order to obtain deliverance; not that it is necessary to allege reasons to
persuade God, but because it is profitable to confirm our faith by such
supports. As, then, it is the will of God that he should be known in his
gracious character, not only of one or two, but generality of all men, whenever
he vouchsafes deliverance to any of his children, it is a common benefit which
all the faithful ought to apply to themselves when they see in the person of one
man in what manner God, who is never inconsistent with himself, will act towards
all his people. David, therefore, shows that he asks nothing for himself
individually but what pertains to the whole Church. He prays that God would
gladden the hearts of all the saints, or afford them all common cause of
rejoicing: so that, assured of his readiness to help them, they may have
recourse to him with greater alacrity. Hence we conclude, that, in the case of
every individual, God gives a proof of his goodness towards us. What is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>those that love thy
salvation,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is also worthy of being
observed by us. We may infer from this, that our faith is only proved to be
genuine when we neither expect nor desire preservation otherwise than from God
alone. Those who devise various ways and means of preservation for themselves in
this world, despise and reject the salvation which God has taught us to expect
from him alone. What had been said before,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>those who seek
thee,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is to the same purpose. If any
individual would depend wholly upon God, and desire to be saved by his grace, he
must renounce every vain hope, and employ all his thoughts towards the reception
of his strength. Here, again, we must observe that two things are contrasted
with each other. Formerly David had said that the wicked <i>sought </i>his life;
now he ascribes to the faithful quite a contrary feeling, namely, that they seek
God. In like manner he had related the reproaches and derision of the ungodly,
while they said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Aha,
aha!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and now he introduces the godly
speaking very differently, saying, The Lord be
magnified!</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But I am poor and
needy.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this concluding clause he
mingles prayer with thanksgiving, although it may be that he records a request
which he had made when he was placed in extreme danger. The first clause of the
verse might be rendered thus: Although I was miserable and poor, God did think
upon me. As according to the extent in which any one is afflicted, so is he
despised by the world, we imagine that he is disregarded by God, we must,
therefore, steadfastly maintain that our miseries in no respect produce on the
part of God a feeling of weariness towards us, so that it should become
troublesome to him to aid us. In this way, however, let us rather read the
clause: When I was miserable and poor, the Lord looked upon my necessity: So
that by this circumstance he enhances the grace of God. If God anticipate us
with his goodness, and do not wait till adversity presses upon us, then his
favor towards us is not so apparent. This comparison, therefore, illustrates
very clearly the glory of God in the deliverance of David, inasmuch as he
vouchsafed to stretch forth his hand to a man who was despised and rejected of
all men, nay, who was destitute of all help and hope. Now, if it was necessary
that David should have been reduced to this extremity, it is no wonder if
persons in a more private station are often humbled after this manner, that they
may feel and acknowledge in good earnest that they have been delivered out of
despair by the hand of God. The simple and natural meaning of the prayer is
this, Lord, thou art my help and my deliverer, therefore delay not to come to my
aid. As it is a foolish thing to approach God with a doubtful and wavering mind,
the Psalmist takes courage, as he was wont to do from his own experience, and
persuades himself that the help of God, by which he had been hitherto preserved,
would not fail him.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM

<div><font face="Palatino">David, while he was severely afflicted by the hand of
God, perceived that he was unjustly blamed by men who regarded him as one who
had already been condemned and devoted to eternal destruction. Under this trial
he fortifies himself by the consolation of hope. At the same time, he complains
partly of the cruelty, and partly of the treachery, of his enemies. And although
he recognises the affliction with which he is visited as a just punishment of
his sins, yet he charges his enemies with cruelty and malice, inasmuch as they
troubled and afflicted one who had always endeavored to do them good. Finally,
he records an expression of his gratitude and joy, because he had been preserved
by the grace of God.</font><br></div>

judgeth wisely of the poor.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Interpreters
are generally of opinion that the exercise of kindness and compassion manifested
in taking care of the miserable, and helping them, is here commended. Those,
however, who maintain that the Psalmist here commends the considerate candour of
those who judge wisely and charitably of men in adversity, form a better
judgment of his meaning. Indeed, the participle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lyk&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
maskil, </i>cannot be explained in any other way. At the same time, it ought to
be observed on what account it is that David declares those to be blessed who
form a wise and prudent judgment concerning the afflictions by which God
chastises his servants. We have said that he had to contend in his own heart
against the perverse judgments of foolish and wicked men, because, when
affliction was pressing heavily upon him, many considered that he had fallen
into a desperate condition, and was altogether beyond the hope of recovery.
Doubtless, it happened to him as it did to the holy patriarch Job, whom his
friends reckoned to be one of the most wicked of men, when they saw God treating
him with great severity. And certainly it is an error which is by far too common
among men, to look upon those who are oppressed with afflictions as condemned
and reprobate. As, on the one hand, the most of men, judging of the favor of God
from an uncertain and transitory state of prosperity, applaud the rich, and
those upon whom, as they say, fortune smiles; so, on the other hand, they act
contemptuously towards the wretched and miserable, and foolishly imagine that
God hates them, because he does not exercise so much forbearance towards them as
he does towards the reprobate. The error of which we speak, namely, that of
judging wrongfully and wickedly, is one which has prevailed in all ages of the
world. The Scriptures in many places plainly and distinctly declare, that God,
for various reasons, tries the faithful by adversities, at one time to train
them to patience, at another to subdue the sinful affections of the flesh, at
another to cleanse, and, as it were, purify them from the remaining desires of
the flesh, which still dwell within them; sometimes to humble them, sometimes to
make them an example to others, and at other times to stir them up to the
contemplation of the divine life. For the most part, indeed, we often speak
rashly and indiscriminately concerning others, and, so to speak, plunge even
into the lowest abyss those who labor under affliction. To restrain such a rash
and unbridled spirit, David says that they are blessed who do not suffer
themselves, by speaking at random, to judge harshly of their neighbors; but,
discerning aright the afflictions by which they are visited, mitigate, by the
wisdom of the Spirit, the severe and unjust judgments to which we are naturally
so prone. I have just adduced as an example the case of Job, whom his friends,
when they saw him involved in extreme misery, hesitated not to account an
outcast, and one whose case was altogether
hopeless.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb101</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> If any one endued with candour, and
possessed of a humane disposition, should meet with such a case, he would regard
it in the exercise of the same discretion which David here commends. As to
ourselves, being admonished by this testimony of the Holy Spirit, let us learn
to guard against a too precipitate judgment. We must therefore judge prudently
of our brethren who are in affliction; that is to say, we must hope well of
their salvation, lest, if we condemn them unmercifully before the time, this
unjust severity in the end fall upon our own heads. It ought, however,
especially to be observed, what indeed I have already noticed, that the object
which David had in view, when he saw himself, as it were, overwhelmed by the
malicious and cruel judgments which were expressed concerning him, was to
fortify himself by this as a ground of consolation, lest he should sink under
the temptation. If, therefore, at any time Satan should endeavor to destroy the
foundation of our faith, by the rash and presumptuous judgments of men, let us
also learn to have recourse to this device of wisdom, lest unawares we fall into
despair. This is the proper use of the doctrine contained in this
passage.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord will deliver
him in the day of evil.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some connect
these words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the day of
evil,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>with the preceding clause; and the
reading thus suggested might indeed be admitted; but the distinction which I
have followed is better adapted to the sense, and is also supported by the
Hebrew accent. Thus at least the doctrine deducible from these words is
susceptible of a fuller meaning, namely, that the Lord will deliver the poor in
the day of his adversity. Some think that David here prays for a blessing in
behalf of the upright and compassionate; as if he had said, May the Lord himself
recompense them again for their kindness, if at any time it happen that they are
grievously afflicted! Others suppose that David here records the language of
such men from which we may come to the knowledge of their wisdom and
uprightness. In my opinion, however, both are equally in error in reading this
clause in the form of a desire or prayer. Whether, indeed, David speaks in his
own name, or in the name of others, he briefly recommends and enjoins the
kindness which we ought to exercise towards the afflicted; for although God may
for a time manifest his displeasure against them, yet he will, nevertheless, be
gracious to them, so that the issue will at length be happier and more joyful
than the judgment we might be led to form from the present aspect of things. We
now see that the sense in which I have explained this verse is much more copious
and fuller of meaning, namely, that we ought to hope for salvation and
deliverance from the hand of the Lord, even in the day of adversity; for
otherwise, no man who had once fallen into a state of sorrow and sadness would
ever be able to rise again. And this I say, because the design of the Holy
Spirit in this passage is not only to exhort the faithful to be ready in showing
kindness towards their brethren when they see them in affliction, but also to
point out the remedy which has been provided for the mitigation of our sorrow,
whenever our faith is shaken by
adversity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah will keep him,
and preserve him in life.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here David
follows out the same sentiment expressed in the preceding verse, when he says
that the Lord will keep the afflicted, whose destruction cruel and unjust men
represent as inevitable. It is likewise necessary always to bear in mind the
contrast which is stated between the day of evil and the blessing of
deliverance. In this verse the expressions denoting <i>restoration to life,
</i>and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>blessedness on the
earth,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>are of similar import. By these
expressions, David means to show that although he had been to all appearance a
dead man, yet the hope of life both for himself and for all the faithful had not
been extinguished. There might, it is true, appear some inconsistency in his
promising himself a happy life in this world, seeing our condition here would be
miserable indeed if we had not the expectation of a better state in the world to
come. But the answer to this is, that as many had despaired of his recovery, he
expressly declares that he will yet be restored to his former state, and will
continue alive, nay, that in him there will be seen manifest tokens of the favor
of God. He does not in the least exclude by these expressions the hope of a
better life after death. What follows concerning the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bed of
sorrow</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>has led some to form a conjecture
which, in my opinion, is not at all probable. What David says of affliction in
general, without determining what kind of affliction, they regard as applicable
exclusively to sickness. But it is no uncommon thing for those who are sorrowful
and grieved in their minds to throw themselves upon their bed, and to seek
repose; for the hearts of men are sometimes more distressed by grief than by
sickness. It is, certainly, highly probable that David was at that time
afflicted with some very heavy calamity, which might be a token that God was not
a little displeased with him. In the second clause of the verse there is some
obscurity. Some understand the
expression,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> turning the
bed,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>in the same sense as if God, in
order to give some alleviation to his servant in the time of trouble, had made
his bed and arranged it, as we are wont to do to those who are sick, that they
may lay themselves more softly.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb102</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Others hold, and, in my opinion, more
correctly, that when David was restored to health, his bed, which had formerly
served him as a sick couch, was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>turned</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that is to say, changed.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb103</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Thus the sense would be, that although
he now languish in sorrow, whilst the Lord is chastening him and training him by
means of affliction, yet in a little while he will experience relief by the hand
of the same God, and thus recover his
strength.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
41:4-6	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4</b>. I have said, O Jehovah!

it.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>I have said, O Jehovah! have mercy upon
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this verse he shows that in his
adversity he did not seek to soothe his mind by flattery, as the greater part of
men do, who endeavor to assuage their sorrows by some vain consolation. And,
certainly, the man who is guided by the Spirit of God will, when warned of God
by the afflictions with which he is visited, frankly acknowledge his sins, and
quietly submit to the admonitions of his brethren, nay, he will even anticipate
them by a voluntary confession. David here lays down a mark by which he
distinguishes himself from the reprobate and wicked, when he tells us that he
earnestly entreated that his sin might not be laid to his charge, and that he
had sought refuge in the mercy of God. He indeed requests that some alleviation
might be granted to him under the affliction which he endured: but he rises to a
higher source of relief, when he asks that through the forgiveness of his sins
he might obtain reconciliation to God. Those, as we have said elsewhere, invert
the natural order of things, who seek a remedy only for the outward miseries
under which they labor, but all the while neglect the cause of them; acting as a
sick man would do who sought only to quench his thirst, but never thought of the
fever under which he labors, and which is the chief cause of his trouble. Before
David, therefore, speaks at all of the healing of his soul, that is to say, of
his life</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb104</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he first says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Have mercy upon

reason which immediately follows<i> &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for I have sinned against
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In saying so, he confesses that
God is justly displeased with him, and that he can only be restored again to his

<i>ki, </i>in its proper and natural signification, and not adversatively, as
some would understand it. He asks then that God would have mercy upon him
because he had sinned. From that proceeds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the healing of the
soul,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which he interposes between his
prayer and confession, as being the effect of the compassion and mercy of God;
for David expects that as soon as he had obtained forgiveness, he would also
obtain relief from his affliction.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.<i>

speak</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is here used in the sense of <i>to
imprecate. </i>In thus describing the unbecoming conduct of his enemies, he
seeks, as has been elsewhere said, to induce God to have mercy upon him: because
the more that God sees his own people cruelly treated, he is so much the more
disposed mercifully to succor them. Thus David, by his own example, stirs up and
encourages us to greater confidence in God; because the more that our enemies
break forth in their cruelty towards us, so much the more does it procure for us
favor in the sight of God. The terms in which his enemies uttered this
imprecation show how cruel their hatred had been towards him, since it could
only be appeased by his destruction, and that, too, accompanied with shame and
ignominy; for they wished that with his life the very remembrance of his name
should also be blotted out.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And if he come to see me,

this verse relates to his false and treacherous friends. Those who were his
professed enemies made no secret of their enmity against him, but openly
persecuted him; and that he has already shown in the preceding verse. In
addition to this, he now complains that many came to him with professions of
attachment to him, as if they had been his friends, who, nevertheless,
afterwards poured forth their malicious ill-will in secret against him. Enemies
of this sort, who thus cover and conceal their malice, and insinuate themselves
under the mask of a fair appearance, only for the purpose of secretly doing us
mischief, are indeed much more to be feared than those who openly declare their
wicked intentions. Accordingly, having complained of his open enemies, he
proceeds to speak of his pretended friends, of whom he declares that they come
to see him with no other design than

both classes of his enemies; those who sought to oppress him in an open manner,
and in the character of avowed enemies; and those who, under the pretense of
friendship, attempted to do the same thing by deceit and stratagem. Accordingly,
he says that all of them took counsel together about his destruction, just as we
know that wicked men hold much secret consultation respecting their intended
deeds of treachery, and whisper to one another concerning them. Hence he adds
the words <i>to meditate, </i>or

they had thus conspired together for his destruction, on the ground that they

made mention in the beginning of the psalm. They say, therefore, that

too constrained. As to the word

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thing of
Belial</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>(for so it is literally in the
Hebrew,) I understand in this place as meaning an extraordinary and hateful
crime, which, as we commonly say, can never be expiated, and from which there is
no possibility of escape; unless, perhaps, some would rather refer it to the
affliction itself under which he labored, as if his enemies had said that he was
seized by some incurable malady.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon"> fb105
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">But whatever may be as to this, his enemies
regarded it as absolutely certain that God was altogether hostile to him, and
would never be reconciled towards him, since he was chastising him with so much
severity. When they add in the following clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he shall never be able to rise
again,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon"> fb106
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">this clearly shows that they utterly cut off
from him all hope of recovery. And certainly it was a sore temptation to David,
who had in himself the testimony of a good conscience, to think that he was
regarded by men as one who was pursued by the vengeance of God, nay, that they
even cast him headlong into hell. But it pleased God thus to try his servant,
that, trusting to the testimony of his own conscience, he should pay no regard
to what men might say, or be troubled by the reproaches they might cast upon
him. It was also his design to teach us, by his example, that we must seek the
reward of our righteousness elsewhere than in this world, since we see with what
unequal balances the world often sets itself to estimate the difference between
virtue and vice.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Even the man of my
peace.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As the very height of all his
miseries, David here declares that he had found the same treachery in some one,
or, indeed, in many of his greatest friends. For the change of number is very
frequent in the Hebrew language, so that he may speak of several individuals as
if they were only one person. Thus the meaning would be: Not only the common
people, or strangers of whom I had no knowledge or acquaintance, but my greatest
friends, nay, even those with whom I was most intimate, and those of my own
household, whom I admitted to eat and drink with me at my table, vaunt
themselves reproachfully against me. Among the Hebrews, the expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>men of
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>denotes their kinsfolk and
connections; but it was a much closer alliance, and one which ought to have
secured a stricter observance of the laws of friendship,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to eat the bread

if he had employed the appellation, My

metaphorically, and signifies <i>to rise up disdainfully </i>against a man who
is afflicted and cast down.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb108</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Others explain the expression by <i>to
lay wait secretly; </i>but the former interpretation is more appropriate, That
the wicked, seeing that David was placed in embarrassed circumstances, or
already prostrated in the dust, took occasion from this to assail him indirectly
indeed, but, nevertheless, always with insolence; a thing which usually happens
among people of a wicked and servile disposition. Christ, in quoting this
passage,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431318&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
13:18,) applies it to the person of Judas. And certainly we ought to understand
that, although David speaks of himself in this psalm, yet he speaks not as a
common and private person, but as one who represented the person of Christ,
inasmuch as he was, as it were, the example after which the whole Church should
be conformed &#8212; a point well entitled to our attention, in order that each
of us may prepare himself for the same condition. It was necessary that what was
begun in David should be fully accomplished in Christ; and, therefore, it must
of necessity come to pass, that the same thing should be fulfilled in each of
his members, namely, that they should not only suffer from external violence and
force, but also from internal foes, ever ready to betray them, even as Paul
declares that the Church shall be assailed, not only by <i>"fightings
</i>without," but also by <i>"fears </i>within,"

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Do thou, O Jehovah I have
mercy upon me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>From a consideration of
the wrongful cruelty of his enemies, he again takes encouragement to pray. And
there is included in what he says a tacit contrast between God and men; as if he
had said, Since there is to be found no aid or help in the world, but as, on the
contrary, a strange degree of cruelty, or secret malice, every where prevails,
be thou, at least, O Lord! pleased to succor me by thy mercy. This is the course
which ought to be pursued by all the afflicted, whom the world unjustly
persecutes; that is to say, they ought not only to occupy themselves in
bewailing the wrongs which are done them, but they ought also to commend their
cause to God: and the more Satan endeavors to overthrow their faith, and to
distract their thoughts, the more should they fix their minds attentively on God
alone. In using such language, the Psalmist again ascribes his restoration to
the mercy of God as its cause. What he says in the concluding clause of the
verse of taking vengeance seems harsh and unaccountable. If he confessed truly
and from the heart, in the preceding part of the psalm, that God was just in
thus afflicting him, why does he not extend forgiveness to others, as he desires
that forgiveness should be granted to himself? Surely it were a shameful abuse
of the grace of God, if, after having been restored and pardoned by him, we
should refuse to follow his example in showing mercy. Besides, it would have
been a feeling far removed from that of humility or kindness, for David, even
while he was yet in the midst of death, to have desired revenge. But here two
things are to be taken into account: First, David was not as one of the common
people, but a king appointed by God, and invested with authority; and, secondly,
It is not from an impulse of the flesh, but in virtue of the nature of his
office, that he is led to denounce against his enemies the punishment which they
had merited. If, then, each individual indiscriminately, in taking vengeance
upon his enemies, should allege the example of David in his own defense, it is
necessary, first, to take into account the difference which subsists between us
and David, by reason of the circumstances and position in which he was placed by
God;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb110</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and, secondly, it is necessary to
ascertain whether the same zeal which was in him reigns also in us, or rather,
whether we are directed and governed by the same divine Spirit. David, being
king, was entitled, in virtue of his royal authority, to execute the vengeance
of God against the wicked; but as to us our hands are tied. In the second place,
As he represented the person of Christ, so he cherished in his heart pure and
holy affections: and hence it is, that, in speaking as he does in this verse, he
indulged not his own angry spirit, but fulfilled faithfully the duties of the
station to which he had been called of God. In short, in acting thus, he
executed the righteous judgment of God, just in the same way as it is lawful for
us to pray that the Lord himself would take vengeance upon the ungodly; for, as
we are not armed with the power of the sword, it is our duty to have recourse to
the heavenly Judge. At the same time, in beseeching him to show himself our
guardian and defender, by taking vengeance on our enemies, we must do so in a
calm and composed state of mind, and exercise a watchful care lest we should
give too loose reins to our desires, by casting off the rule prescribed by the
Spirit. As to David, the duties of his station required that he should employ
means for subduing the rebellious, and that he should be truly the minister of
God in inflicting punishment upon all the
wicked.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By this I know that I
have been acceptable to thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>David now
proceeds to the exercise of thanksgiving; unless, indeed, by altering the tense
of the verb, we would rather with some read this verse in connection with the
preceding, in this way: In this I shall know that thou favorest me, if thou
suffer not my enemies to triumph over me; but it suits much better to understand
it as an expression of joy on account of some deliverance which God had
vouchsafed to him. After having offered up his prayers, he now ascribes his
deliverance to God, and speaks of it as a manifest and singular benefit he had
received from him. It might, however, be asked, whether it is a sufficiently
sure method of our coming to the knowledge of God's love towards us, that he
does not suffer our enemies to triumph over us? for it will often happen, that a
man is delivered from danger, whom, nevertheless, God does not regard with
pleasure; and, besides, the good-will of God towards us is known chiefly from
his word, and not simply by experience. The answer to this is easy: David was
not destitute of faith, but for the confirmation of it he took advantage of the
helps which God had afterwards added to his word. In speaking thus, he seems to
refer not only to the favor and good-will which God bears to all the faithful in
common, but to the special favor which God had conferred upon him in choosing
him to be king; as if he had said, Now, Lord, I am more and more confirmed in
the belief that thou hast vouchsafed to adopt me to be the first-born among the
kings of the earth. Thus he extends to the whole state of the realm the help of
God, by means of which he had been delivered from some particular
calamity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And as for me, thou wilt
uphold me in my integrity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some expound
the clause thus: That, as David followed after uprightness, God had stretched
out the hand to him. But this interpretation does not agree very well with a
preceding sentence, in which he acknowledged that he had been justly punished by
God. The calamity which had befallen him exposed him to the insult and derision
of his enemies; but it is not likely that they were the authors of it: and
hence, it would have been out of place to have adduced his integrity for this
purpose, because the Lord is said to have respect to our integrity, when he
defends us against our enemies, and delivers us from the outrage of men. We must
therefore seek another meaning. The Hebrew word which we have rendered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>integrity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>might be referred to the body as well as the mind, thus: I shall continue
<i>sound, </i>because thou wilt preserve and establish me. He seems, however, to
extend the favor of God still farther; as if he had said, that he had been
assisted not only once by his hand, but that, during the whole course of the
period he had enjoyed prosperity, he had always been upheld in safety by the
power of God. If any would rather understand by this term the piety and sincere
disposition for which David was distinguished, &#8212; and this meaning would be
very suitable, &#8212; it will not follow from this that David boasts of his
past life, but only that he declares that, when brought to the test, or in the
midst of the conflict, even although Satan and wicked men endeavored to shake
his faith, he had not turned aside from the fear of God. By these words, then,
he bears testimony to his patience, because, when sorely vexed and tormented, he
had not forsaken the path of uprightness. If this meaning should be adopted, it
must be observed, that this benefit, namely, that David continued invincible,
and boldly sustained these assaults of temptation, is immediately after ascribed
to God, and that for the future, David looked for preservation by no other means
than by the sustaining power of God. If the language should be understood as
referring to his external condition, this will be found to suit equally well the
scope of the passage, and the meaning will be this, That God will never cease to
manifest his favor, until he has preserved his servants in safety, even to the
end. As to the form of expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that God establishes them before
his face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>this is said of those whom he
defends and preserves in such a manner, that he shows by evident tokens the
paternal care which he exercises over them; as, on the other hand, when he seems
to have forgotten his own people, he is said to hide his face from
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13<i>.</i>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
42</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the first place, David shows that when he was
forced to flee by reason of the cruelty of Saul, and was living in a state of
exile, what most of all grieved him was, that he was deprived of the opportunity
of access to the sanctuary; for he preferred the service of God to every earthly
advantage. In the second place, he shows that being tempted with despair, he had
in this respect a very difficult contest to sustain. In order to strengthen his
hope, he also introduces prayer and meditation on the grace of God. Last of all,
he again makes mention of the inward conflict which he had with the sorrow which
he experienced.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>To the chief
musician. A lesson of instruction to the sons of Korah.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The name of David is not expressly mentioned in the
inscription of this psalm. Many conjecture that the sons of Korah were the
authors of it. This, I think, is not at all probable. As it is composed in the
person of David, who, it is well known, was endued above all others with the
spirit of prophecy, who will believe that it was written and composed for him by
another person? He was the teacher generally of the whole Church, and a
distinguished instrument of the Spirit. He had already delivered to the company
of the Levites, of whom the sons of Korah formed a part, other psalms to be sung
by them. What need, then, had he to borrow their help, or to have recourse to
their assistance in a matter which he was much better able of himself to execute
than they were? To me, therefore, it seems more probable, that the sons of Korah
are here mentioned because this psalm was committed as a precious treasure to be
preserved by them, as we know that out of the number of the singers, some were
chosen and appointed to be keepers of the psalms. That there is no mention made
of David's name does not of itself involve any difficulty, since we see the same
omission in other psalms, of which there is, notwithstanding, the strongest
grounds for concluding that he was the author. As to the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lyk&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>maskil, </i>I have already made some remarks upon it in the thirty-second
psalm. This word, it is true, is sometimes found in the inscription of other
psalms besides those in which David declares that he had been subjected to the
chastening rod of God. It is, however, to be observed, that it is properly
applied to chastisements, since the design of them is to instruct the children
of God, when they do not sufficiently profit from doctrine. As to the particular
time of the composition of this psalm, expositors are not altogether agreed.
Some suppose that David here complains of his calamity, when he was expelled
from the throne by his son Absalom. But I am rather disposed to entertain a
different opinion, founded, if I mistake not, upon good reasons. The rebellion
of Absalom was very soon suppressed, so that it did not long prevent David from
approaching the sanctuary. And yet, the lamentation which he here makes refers
expressly to a long state of exile, under which he had languished, and, as it
were, pined away with grief. It is not the sorrow merely of a few days which he
describes in the third verse; nay, the scope of the entire composition will
clearly show that he had languished for a long time in the wretched condition of
which he speaks. It has been alleged as an argument against referring this psalm
to the reign of Saul, that the ark of the covenant was neglected during his
reign, so that it is not very likely that David at that time conducted the
stated choral services in the sanctuary; but this argument is not very
conclusive: for although Saul only worshipped God as a mere matter of form, yet
he was unwilling to be regarded in any other light than as a devout man. And as
to David, he has shown in other parts of his writings with what diligence he
frequented the holy assemblies, and more especially on festival days. Certainly,
these words which we shall meet with in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;195514&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
55:14, "We walked unto the house of God in company," relate to the time of

</i>The meaning of these two verses simply is, that David preferred to all the
enjoyments, riches, pleasures, and honors of this world, the opportunity of
access to the sanctuary, that in this way he might cherish and strengthen his
faith and piety by the exercises prescribed in the Law. When he says that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cried for the living
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>we are not to understand it merely
in the sense of a burning love and desire towards God: but we ought to remember
in what manner it is that, God allures us to himself, and by what means he
raises our minds upwards. He does not enjoin us to ascend forthwith into heaven,
but, consulting our weakness, he descends to us. David, then, considering that
the way of access was shut against him, cried to God, because he was excluded
from the outward service of the sanctuary, which is the sacred bond of
intercourse with God. I do not mean to say that the observance of external
ceremonies can of itself bring us into favor with God, but they are religious
exercises which we cannot bear to want by reason of our infirmity. David,
therefore, being excluded from the sanctuary, is no less grieved than if he had
been separated from God himself. He did not, it is true, cease in the meantime
to direct his prayers towards heaven, and even to the sanctuary itself; but
conscious of his own infirmity, he was specially grieved that the way by which
the faithful obtained access to God was shut against him. This is an example
which may well suffice to put to shame the arrogance of those who without
concern can bear to be deprived of those
means,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb113</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> or rather, who proudly despise them, as
if it were in their power to ascend to heaven in a moment's flight; nay, as if
they surpassed David in zeal and alacrity of mind. We must not, however, imagine
that the prophet suffered himself to rest in earthly
elements,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb114</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but only that he made use of them as a
ladder, by which he might ascend to God, finding that he had not wings with
which to fly thither. The similitude which he takes
from</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> a
hart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is designed to express the extreme
ardor of his desire. The sense in which some explain this is, that the waters
are eagerly sought by the harts, that they may recover from fatigue; but this,
perhaps, is too limited. I admit that if the hunter pursue the stag, and the
dogs also follow hard after it, when it comes to a river it gathers new strength
by plunging into it. But we know also that at certain seasons of the year,
harts, with an almost incredible desire, and more intensely than could proceed
from mere thirst, seek after water; and although I would not contend for it, yet
I think this is referred to by the prophet
here.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The second verse illustrates more clearly
what I have already said, that David does not simply speak of the presence of
God, but of the presence of God in connection with certain symbols; for he sets
before himself the tabernacle, the altar, the sacrifices, and other ceremonies
by which God had testified that he would be near his people; and that it behoved
the faithful, in seeking to approach God, to begin by those things. Not that
they should continue attached to them, but that they should, by the help of
these signs and outward means, seek to behold the glory of God, which of itself
is hidden from the sight. Accordingly, when we see the marks of the divine
presence engraven on the word, or on external symbols, we can say with David
that there </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is the face of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>provided we come with pure hearts
to seek him in a spiritual manner. But when we imagine God to be present
otherwise than he has revealed himself in his word, and the sacred institutions
of his worship, or when we form any gross or earthly conception of his heavenly
majesty, we are only inventing for ourselves visionary representations, which
disfigure the glory of God, and turn his truth into a
lie.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My tears have been my
bread</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here the Psalmist mentions
another sharp piercing shaft with which the wicked and malevolent grievously
wounded his heart. There can be no doubt that Satan made use of such means as
these to fan the flame that consumed him with grief. "What," we may suppose that
adversary to say, "wouldst thou have? Seest thou not that God hath cast thee
off? For certainly he desires to be worshipped in the tabernacle, to which you
have now no opportunity of access, and from which you are as it were banished."
These were violent assaults, and enough to have overturned the faith of this
holy man, unless, supported by the power of the Spirit in a more than ordinary
degree, he had made a strong and vigorous resistance. It is evident that his
feelings had been really and strongly affected. We may be often agitated, and
yet not to such an extent as to abstain from eating and drinking; but when a man
voluntarily abstains from food, and indulges so much in weeping, that he daily
neglects his ordinary meals, and is continually overwhelmed in sorrow, it is
obvious that he is troubled in no light degree; but that he is wounded severely,
and even to the heart.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb115</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Now, David says, that he did not
experience greater relief in any thing whatever than from weeping; and,
therefore, he gave himself up to it, just in the same manner as men take
pleasure and enjoyment in eating; and this he says had been the case every day,
and not only for a short time. Let us, therefore, whenever the ungodly triumph
over us in our miseries, and spitefully taunt us that God is against us, never
forget that it is Satan who moves them to speak in this manner, in order to
overthrow our faith; and that, therefore, it is not time for us to take our
ease, or to yield to indifference, when a war so dangerous is waged against us.
There is still another reason which ought to inspire us with such feelings, and
it is this, that the name of God is held up to scorn by the ungodly; for they
cannot scoff at our faith without greatly reproaching him. If, then, we are not

</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When I remember these
things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This verse is somewhat obscure,
on account of the variation of the tenses in the Hebrew. And yet I have no doubt
that the true and natural sense is, that David, when he called to remembrance
his former condition, experienced so much the greater sadness by comparing it
with his present condition. The remembrance, I say, of the past had no small
influence in aggravating his misery, from the thought that he, who had formerly
acted the part of a leader and standard-bearer in conducting others to the holy
assemblies, should now be debarred from access to the temple. We know that those
who have been accustomed to suffering from their childhood become insensible to
it, and the very continuance of misery produces in us a certain degree of
callousness, so that we cease to think of it, or to regard it as anything
unusual. It is different with those who have not been so accustomed to it. And,
therefore, it is no wonder if David, who had been not one of the common people,
but who had lately occupied a chief place among the princes, and had been leader
of the foremost ranks among the faithful, should be more grievously disquieted,
when he saw himself utterly cast off, and not admitted to a place even among the
lowest. Accordingly, I connect the demonstrative pronoun
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>these</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>with the declaration which follows, namely, that he remembered how he had
been accustomed to mingle in the company of the godly, and to lead them to the
house of God. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To pour
out</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
soul</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is taken metaphorically by some for
to give utterance to his grief<i>; </i>others are of opinion, that it signifies
to rejoice greatly<i>, </i>or, as we commonly speak, to be melted or dissolved
in joy<i>. </i>It appears to me that David rather means to say, that his
affections were, as it were, melted within him, whether it were from joy or
sorrow. As the soul of man sustains him, so long as it keeps its energies
collected, so also it sinks within him, and, as it were, vanishes away, when any
of the affections, by excessive indulgence, gains the
ascendancy.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb118</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Accordingly, he is said to pour out his
soul, who is so excited, that his affections lose their vigor, and begin to flow
out. David's language implies, that his soul melted and fainted within him by
the greatness of his sorrow, when he thought of the condition from which he had
fallen. If any would rather understand it of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>joy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>the language will admit of such an illustration as this: Formerly I took
such a delight in walking foremost in the ranks of the people, and leading them
in procession to the sanctuary, that my heart melted within me for joy, and I
was quite transported with it: if, therefore, I should again be restored to the
same happy condition, all my feelings would be ravished with the same delight. I
have, however, already stated what appeared to me to be the best exposition. We
must not suppose that David had been overwhelmed with the sorrow of the world;
but, as in his present misery he discerned the wrath of God, he sorrowed after a
godly sort, because, by his own fault, he had provoked the displeasure of God
against him. And, even without touching this reason of his sorrow, we see the
source from which it proceeded. Even when afflicted by so many personal
privations, he is nevertheless grieved only for the sanctuary, thereby showing
that it would have been less distressing to him to have been deprived of life,
than to continue in a state of exile from the presence of God. And, indeed, the
way in which we ought to regulate all our affections is this, That, on the one
hand, our joy may have respect to the paternal love and favor of God towards us,
and that, on the other, the only cause of our grief may arise from feeling that
he is angry with us. This is the "godly sorrow" of which Paul speaks,

<i>sach, </i>David, I have no doubt, intended <i>ranks, </i>or <i>companies in
procession; </i>for when they went to the tabernacle on the holy days, they went
not in confusion or in crowds, but walked in regular order,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;420244&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
2:44.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O my soul! why art thou
cast down?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>From this it appears that
David contended strongly against his sorrow, lest he should yield to temptation:
but what we ought chiefly to observe is, that he had experienced a strong and
bitter contest before he obtained the victory over it; or we might rather say,
that he was not delivered from it after one alarming assault, but was often
called upon to enter into new scenes of conflict. It need not excite our wonder
that he was so much disquieted and cast down, since he could not discern any
sign of the divine favor towards him. But David here represents himself as if he
formed two opposing parties. In so far as in the exercise of faith he relied
upon the promises of God, being armed with the Spirit of invincible fortitude,
he set himself, in opposition to the affections of his flesh, to restrain and
subdue them; and, at the same time, he rebuked his own cowardice and imbecility
of heart. Moreover, although he carried on war against the devil and the world,
yet he does not enter into open and direct conflict with them, but rather
regards himself as the enemy against whom he desires chiefly to contend. And
doubtless the best way to overcome Satan is, not to go out of ourselves, but to
maintain an internal conflict against he desires of our own hearts. It ought,
however, to be observed, that David confesses that his soul was cast down within
him: for when our infirmities rise up in vast array, and, like the waves of the
sea, are ready to overwhelm us, our faith seems to us to fail, and, in
consequence we are so overcome by mere fear, that we lack courage, and are
afraid to enter into the conflict. Whenever, therefore, such a state of
indifference and faint-heartedness shall seize upon us, let us remember, that to
govern and subdue the desires of their hearts, and especially to contend against
the feelings of distrust which are natural to all, is a conflict to which the
godly are not unfrequently called. But here there are two evils specified,
which, however apparently different, yet assail our hearts at the same time; the
one is <i>discouragement, </i>and the other
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>disquietude</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>When we are quite downcast, we are not free of a feeling of disquietude,
which leads us to murmur and complain. The remedy to both of them is here added,
<i>hope in God, </i>which alone inspires our minds, in the first place, with
confidence in the midst of the greatest troubles; and, secondly, by the exercise
of patience, preserves them in peace. In what follows, David very well expresses
the power and nature of hope by these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I shall yet praise
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for it has the effect of elevating
our thoughts to the contemplation of the grace of God, when it is hidden from
our view. By the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>yet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he confesses that for the present, and in so far as the praises of God are
concerned, his mouth is stopped, seeing he is oppressed and shut up on all
sides. This, however, does not prevent him from extending his hope to some
future distant period; and, in order to escape from his present sorrow, and, as
it were, get beyond its reach, he promises himself what as yet there was no
appearance of obtaining. Nor is this an imaginary expectation produced by a
fanciful mind; but, relying upon the promises of God, he not only encourages
himself to cherish good hope, but also promises himself certain deliverance. We
can only be competent witnesses to our brethren of the grace of God when, in the
first place, we have borne testimony to it to our own hearts. What follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The helps of his
countenance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>may be differently
expounded. Commentators, for the most art, supply the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:
</i>so that, according to this view, David here expresses the matter or cause of
thanksgiving &#8212; that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>yet he
would give praise or thanks to God for the help of his
countenance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This interpretation I
readily admit. At the same time, the sense will not be inappropriate if we read
the terms separately, thus: <i>helps or salvations are from the countenance of
God; </i>for as soon as he is pleased to look upon his people he sets them in
safety. <i>The countenance of God </i>is taken for the manifestation of his
favor. His countenance then appears serene and gracious to us; as, on the
contrary, adversity, like the intervening clouds, darkens or obscures its benign
aspect.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O my God! my soul is cast
down within me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>If we suppose that this
verse requires no supplement, then it will consist of two distinct and separate
sentences. Literally it may be read thus:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O my God! my soul is cast down
within me, therefore will I remember thee,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
etc.</i>But the greater number of expositors render the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;kAl[</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
al-ken, </i>by <i>forasmuch as, </i>or <i>because, </i>so that it is employed to
express the reason of what is contained in the preceding clause. And certainly
it would be very appropriate in this sense, That as often as David, from the
land of Jordan, in which he now lay hid as an exile, set himself to think of the
sanctuary, his sorrow was so much the more increased. If, however, any would
rather, as I have already observed, distinguish this verse into two parts, it
must be understood as meaning that David thought of God in his exile, not to
nourish his grief, but to assuage it. He did not act the part of those who find
no relief in their afflictions but in forgetting God; for although wounded by
his hand, he, nevertheless, failed not to acknowledge him to be his physician.
Accordingly, the import of the whole verse will be this, I am now living in a
state of exile, banished from the temple, and seem to be an alien from the
household of God; but this will not prevent me from regarding him, and having
recourse to him. I am now deprived of the accustomed sacrifices, of which I
stand much in need, but he has not taken from me his word. As, however, the
first interpretation is the one more generally received, and this also seems to
be added by way of exposition, it is better not to depart from it. David then
complains that his soul was oppressed with sorrow, because he saw himself cast
out of the Church of God. At the same time, there is in these words a tacit
contrast;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb119</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as if he had said, It is not the desire
to be restored to my wife, or my house, or any of my possessions, which grieves
me so much as the distressing consideration, that I now find myself prevented
from taking part in the service of God. We ought to learn from this, that
although we are deprived of the helps which God has appointed for the
edification of our faith and piety, it is, nevertheless, our duty to be diligent
in stirring up our minds, that we may never suffer ourselves to be forgetful of
God. But, above all, this is to be observed, that as in the preceding verse we
have seen David contending courageously against his own affections, so now we
here see by what means he steadfastly maintained his ground. He did this by
having recourse to the help of God, and taking refuge in it as in a holy
sanctuary. And, assuredly, if meditation upon the promises of God do not lead us
to prayer, it will not have sufficient power to sustain and confirm us. Unless
God impart strength to us, how shall we be able to subdue the many evil thoughts
which constantly arise in our minds? The soul of man serves the purpose, as it
were, of a workshop to Satan in which to forge a thousand methods of despair.
And, therefore, it is not without reason that David, after a severe conflict
with himself, has recourse to prayer, and calls upon God as the witness of his
sorrow. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By the land of
Jordan</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is to be understood that part of
the country which, in respect of Judea, was beyond the river of that name. This
appears still more clearly from the word Hermonim or Hermons. Hermon was a
mountainous district, which extended to a considerable distance; and because it
had several tops, was called in the plural number
Hermonim.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb120</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">Perhaps David also has purposely
made use of the plural number on account of the fear by which he was forced
frequently to change his place of abode, and wander hither and thither. As to
the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Mizar</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>some suppose that it was not the proper name of a mountain, and therefore
translate it <i>little, </i>supposing that there is here an indirect comparison
of the Hermons with the mountain of Sion, as if David meant to say that Sion,
which was comparatively a small hill, was greater in his estimation than the
lofty Hermons; but it appears to me that this would be a constrained
interpretation.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

grievousness, as well as the number and long continuance, of the miseries which
he suffered; as if he had said, I am oppressed not only with one kind of misery,
but various kinds of distress return one after another, so that there seems to
be neither end nor measure to them. In the first place, by the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>depth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he shows that the temptations by which he was assailed were such, that they
might well be compared to gulfs in the sea; then he complains of their long
continuance, which he describes by the very appropriate figure, that his
temptations cry out from a distance, and call to one another. In the second part
of the verse, he continues the same metaphor, when he says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all the waves and floods of God
have passed over his head</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By this he
means that he had been overwhelmed, and as it were swallowed up by the
accumulation of afflictions. It ought, however, to be observed, that he
designates the cruelty of Saul, and his other enemies<i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>floods of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that in all our adversities we may
always remember to humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God which afflicts
us. But it is of importance to go beyond this, and to consider, that if it
should please God to rain with violence upon us, as soon as he shall have opened
his sluices or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>waterspouts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>there will be no termination to our miseries till he is appeased; for he has
in his power means marvellous and unknown for executing his vengeance against
us. Thus, when once his anger is kindled against us, there will be not only one
depth to swallow us up, but depth will call unto depth. And as the insensibility
of men is such, that they do not stand in awe of the threatenings of God, to the
degree in which they ought, whenever mention is made of his vengeance, let us
recall this verse to our recollection.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah will command his
loving-kindness by day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The verb here
used is of the future tense; but I do not deny that, according to the Hebrew
idiom, it might be rendered in the past tense, as some do who think that David
here enumerates the benefits which he had formerly received from God, in order
by contrast to add greater force to the complaint which he makes of his present
sad and miserable condition; as if he had said, How comes it to pass that God,
who formerly manifested so much kindness towards me, having as it were changed
his mind, now deals towards me with great severity? But as there is no
sufficient reason for changing the tense of the verb, and as the other
interpretation seems more in accordance with the scope of the text, let us
adhere to it. I do not, indeed, positively deny, that for the strengthening of
his faith, David calls to memory the benefits which he had already experienced
from God; but I think that he here promises himself deliverance in future,
though it be as yet hidden from him. I have, therefore, no desire to raise any
discussion regarding the verb, whether it should be taken in the future or in
the past tense, provided only it be fully admitted that the argument of David is
to this effect: Why should I not expect that God will be merciful to me, so that
in the day-time his loving-kindness may be manifested towards me, and by night
upon my bed a song of joy be with me? He, no doubt, places this ground of
comfort in opposition to the sorrow which he might well apprehend from the
dreadful tokens of the divine displeasure, which he has enumerated in the
preceding verse. The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prayer</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of which he speaks in the end of the verse is not to be understood as the
prayer of an afflicted or sorrowful man; but it comprehends an expression of the
delight which is experienced when God, by manifesting his favor to us, gives us
free access into his presence. And, therefore, he also calls him
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the God of his
life,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>because from the knowledge of this
arises cheerfulness of heart.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

the past tense, the meaning of this verse will be, Since God has, in this way,
heretofore shown himself so kind towards me, I will pray to him now with so much
the greater confidence: for the experience which I have had of his goodness will
inspire me with courage. But if the preceding verse is rendered in the future
tense, David, in this verse, combines the prayer which it contains with the
reflections which faith led him to make. And, surely, whoever, from a persuasion
of the paternal love of God, anticipates for himself the same favor which David
has just described, will also be induced from his example to pray for it with
greater confidence. The meaning, then, will be this: Since I expect that God
will be favorable to me, inasmuch as by day he manifests his favor towards me,
and continues to do this, so that even by night I have occasion to praise him, I
will bewail the more frankly my miseries before him, saying, <i>O</i> <i>Lord!
my rock, why hast thou forgotten me? </i>In making such a complaint, the
faithful are not to be understood as meaning that God has utterly rejected them:
for if they did not believe that they were under his care and protection, it
were in vain for them to call upon him. But they speak in this manner according
to the sense of the flesh. This forgetfulness, then, relates both to outward
appearance, and to the disquietude by which the faithful are troubled according
to the flesh, although, in the meantime, they rest assured by faith that God
regards them, and will not be deaf to their
request.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10<i>.</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>

</i>This verse is somewhat involved in point of expression; but as to the
meaning of it there is no obscurity. David here affirms that the grief which he
experienced from the reproaches of his enemies, wounded him in no degree less
than if they had pierced through his bones. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hxrb</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
beretsach, </i>signifies <i>killing; </i>and, therefore, I have retained this
idea in the translation of it. And yet I do not condemn the opinion of those who
render it <i>a slaughtering sword.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb124</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>There is here a difference as to
the reading, arising from the great similarity which there is between the two

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">k</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>beth, </i>is often superfluous, I would rather be disposed, in a doubtful
matter like this, to omit it altogether. But as I have said, the sense is
perfectly plain, except that interpreters do not seem to take this sufficiently
into their consideration, that by the terms
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>my
bones</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the bitterness of grief is
referred to; for we feel much more acutely any injury which is done to the
bones, than if a sword should pierce the bowels, or the other parts of the body
which are soft and yielding. Nor should the children of God regard this
similitude as hyperbolical; and if one should wonder why David took so sorely to
heart the derision of his enemies, he only manifests in this his own
insensibility. For of all the bitter evils which befall us, there is nothing
which can inflict upon us a severer wound than to see the wicked tear in pieces
the majesty of God, and endeavor to destroy and overturn our faith. The doctrine
taught by Paul,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480424&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
4:24,) concerning the persecution of Ishmael, is well known. Many consider his
childish jesting as of little moment, but as it tended to this effect, that the
covenant of God should be esteemed as a thing of no value, it is on that
account, according to the judgment of the Holy Spirit, to be accounted a most
cruel persecution. David, therefore, with much propriety, compares to a
slaughtering sword, which penetrates even within the bones and marrow, the
derision of his enemies, by which he saw his own faith and the word of God
trampled under foot. And would to God that all who boast themselves of being his
children would learn to bear their private wrongs more patiently, and to
manifest the same vehement zeal for which David is here distinguished, when
their faith is assailed to the dishonor of God, and when the word also which
gives them life is included in the same
reproach!</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11<i>.</i>
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O my soul! why art thou cast

David had not so completely overcome his temptations in one encounter, or by one
extraordinary effort, as to render it unnecessary for him to enter anew into the
same conflict. By this example, therefore, we are admonished, that although
Satan, by his assaults, often subjects us to a renewal of the same trouble, we
ought not to lose our courage, or allow ourselves to be cast down. The latter
part of this verse differs from the fifth verse in one word, while in every
other respect they agree. In the fifth verse, it is the

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>w</i></font><font face="Palatino">,

preceding.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb126</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> David, who probably was the author of
it, being chased and driven out of his country by the unjust violence and
tyranny of his enemies, calls upon God for vengeance, and encourages himself to
hope for restoration.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></b><i>Judge me, O God!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David, in
the first place, complains of the extreme cruelty of his enemies; but in the
verses which immediately follow, he shows that there was nothing which he felt
to be more grievous, than to be deprived of the opportunity of access to the
sanctuary. We have an evidence of his enjoying the testimony of a good
conscience in this, that he commends the defense of his cause to God. The
term<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judge</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>which he first makes use of, is nothing else than
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to undertake the defense of one's
cause</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and he expresses his meaning more
clearly by adding, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>plead my
cause</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The substance and object of his
prayer, indeed, were, that he might be delivered from the wicked and malicious
men by whom he was undeservedly persecuted. But as it is to the miserable and
guiltless, who are wrongfully afflicted, that God promises his help, David, in
the first place, submits himself to be examined by him, that, having discovered
and thoroughly proved the rectitude of his cause, he may at length grant him
aid. And as it is a most cheering source of consolation for us to find that God
disdains not to take cognisance of our cause, so also, it is vain for us to
expect that he will avenge the injuries and wrongs which are done to us, unless
our own integrity be so manifest as to induce him to be favorable to us against
our adversaries. By </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
unmerciful nation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is to be understood
the whole company of David's enemies, who were cruel, and destitute of all the
feelings of humanity. What follows, concerning
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the deceitful and wicked
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>might indeed be applied to Saul;
but it seems rather to be a form of speech in which, by enallage, the singular
number is used for the plural.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thou art the God of
my strength</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This verse differs very
little from the ninth verse of the preceding psalm, and the difference consists
more in words than in matter. Setting as a shield against temptation the fact,
that he had experienced the power of God to be present with him, he complains
that his life is spent in mourning, because he sees himself as it were abandoned
to the will of his enemies. He considered it absolutely certain that his enemies
had no power to do him harm except in so far as the Lord permitted them; and
therefore he asks, as if it were something altogether unaccountable, how it
happened that his enemies prevailed against him whilst he was under the assured
protection and guardianship of God. From this he gathers courage to pray, that
God would be pleased again to manifest his favor, which he seemed to have hid
from him for a time. The term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>light</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is to be understood as denoting <i>favor; </i>for as adversities not only
obscure the face of God, but also overcast the heavens, as it were, with clouds
and fogs, so also, when we enjoy the divine blessing which makes rich, it is
like the cheerful light of a serene day shining around us; or rather the light
of life, dispelling all that thick obscurity which overwhelmed us in sorrow. By
this word the Psalmist intimates two things; first, that all our miseries arise
from no other source than this, that God withdraws from us the tokens of his
paternal love; and, secondly, that as soon as he is pleased to manifest towards
us his serene and gracious countenance, deliverance and salvation also arise to
us. He adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>truth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>because he expected this light only from the promises of God. The
unbelieving desire the favor of God, but they do not raise their eyes to his
light; for the natural disposition of man always tends towards the earth, unless
his mind and all his feelings are raised up on high by the word of God. In
order, then, to encourage himself in the hope of obtaining the grace of God,
David rests with confidence in this, that God, who is true, and cannot deceive
any, has promised to assist his servants. We must therefore explain the sentence
thus: Send forth thy light, that it may be a token and testimony of thy truth,
or that it may really and effectually prove that thou art faithful and free from
all deceit in thy promises. The knowledge of the divine favor, it is true, must
be sought for in the Word of God; nor has faith any other foundation on which it
can rest with security except his word; but when God stretches out his hand to
help us, the experience of this is no small confirmation both of the word and of
faith. David declares what was the chief object of his desire, and what end he
had in view in seeking deliverance from his calamities, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let them direct me, and lead me
to thy holy hill.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As the chief cause of
his sorrow consisted in his being banished from the congregation of the godly,
so he places the height of all his enjoyments in this, that he might be at
liberty to take part in the exercises of religion, and to worship God in the
sanctuary. Tacitly, indeed, David makes a vow of thanksgiving to God; but there
can be no doubt, that by these words he intimates, that the end which he had in
view in seeking deliverance from his afflictions was, that as formerly he might
be at liberty to return to the sanctuary, from which he was driven by the
tyranny of his enemies. And it deserves to be particularly noticed, that
although he had been deprived of his wife, spoiled of his goods, his house, and
all his other earthly comforts, yet he always felt such an ardent desire to come
to the temple, that he forgot almost every thing else. But it is enough for me
at present briefly to notice this, as in the preceding psalm I have treated at
greater length of this holy desire of David, which ought to be imitated by all
the faithful.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb127</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Still, however, it might be asked, How
it is that mention is here made of <i>Mount Sion, </i>which was not appointed to
the service of God till after the death of Saul? The only solution of this
difficulty which I can give is, that David, composing this psalm at an after
period of his life, employs, in accordance with the revelation which had
subsequently been given to him, language which otherwise he would have used more
generally in speaking only of the tabernacle, and without at all specifying the
place.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb128</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In this I see no
inconsistency.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will go to the
altar of God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here he promises to God a
solemn sacrifice, in commemoration of the deliverance which he should obtain
from him; for he speaks not only of the daily or ordinary service, but in making
mention of the altar on which it was customary to offer the peace-offerings, he
expresses the token of gratitude and thanksgiving of which I have spoken. For
this reason, also, he calls God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the God of his
joy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because, being delivered from
sorrow, and restored to a state of joy, he resolves to acknowledge openly so
great a benefit. And he calls him the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>joy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of his
rejoicing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that he may the more
illustriously set forth the grace of his deliverance. The second word in the
genitive is added by way of an epithet, and by it he signifies that his heart
had been filled with joy of no common kind, when God restored him, contrary to
the expectation of all. As to the fifth verse, I have already treated of it
sufficiently in the preceding psalm, and therefore deem it superfluous to speak
of it here.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
44</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This psalm is divided into three principal parts. In
the beginning of it the faithful record the infinite mercy of God towards his
people, and the many tokens by which he had testified his fatherly love towards
them. Then they complain that they do not now find that God is favorable towards
them, as he had formerly been towards their fathers. In the third place, they
refer to the covenant which God had made with Abraham, and declare that they
have kept it with all faithfulness, notwithstanding the sore afflictions to
which they had been subjected. At the same time, they complain that they are
cruelly persecuted for no other cause but for having continued steadfastly in
the pure worship of God. In the end, a prayer is added, that God would not
forget the wrongful oppression of his servants, which especially tends to bring
dishonor and reproach upon religion.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>To the chief
musician of the sons of Korah, giving instruction.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is uncertain who was the author of this psalm; but
it is clearly manifest that it was composed rather by any other person than by
David. The complaints and lamentations which it contains may be appropriately
referred to that miserable and calamitous period in which the outrageous tyranny
of Antiochus destroyed and wasted every
thing.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb129</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some, indeed, may be disposed to apply
it more generally; for after the return of the Jews from the captivity of
Babylon, they were scarcely ever free from severe afflictions. Such a view,
doubtless, would not be applicable to the time of David, under whose reign the
Church enjoyed prosperity, It may be, too, that during the time of their
captivity in Babylon, some one of the prophets composed this complaint in name
of all the people. It is, however, at the same time to be observed, that the
state of the Church, such as it was to be after the appearance of Christ, is
here described. Paul, in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450836&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:36, as we shall afterwards see in its proper place, did not understand this
psalm as a description of the state of the Church in one age only, but he warns
us, that Christians are appointed to the same afflictions, and should not expect
that their condition on earth, even to the end of the world, will be different
from what God has made known to us, as it were by way of example, in the case of
the Jews after their return from captivity. Christ, it is true, afterwards
appeared as the Redeemer of the Church. He did not however appear, that the
flesh should luxuriate in ease upon the earth, but rather that we should wage
war under the banner of the cross, until we are received into the rest of the
heavenly kingdom. As to the meaning of the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lyk&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>maskil, </i>it has been already elsewhere explained. It is sometimes found in
the inscription of psalms whose subject is cheerful; but it is more commonly
used when the subject treated of is distressing; for it is a singular means of
leading us to profit by the instruction of the Lord, when, by subduing the
obduracy of our hearts, he brings us under his
yoke.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
44:1-3	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1</b>. O God! we have heard with
our ears, our fathers have declared to us, the work which thou hast done in

</i></b><i>O God! we have heard with our
ears.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The people of God here recount the
goodness which he had formerly manifested towards their fathers, that, by
showing the great dissimilarity of their own condition, they may induce God to
alleviate their miseries. They begin by declaring that they speak not of things
unknown or doubtful, but that they related events, the truth of which was
authenticated by unexceptionable witnesses. The expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have heard with our
ears</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is not to be considered as a
redundant form of speech, but one of great weight. It is designed to point out
that the grace of God towards their fathers was so renowned, that no doubt could
be entertained respecting it. They add, that their knowledge of these things was
handed down from age to age by those who witnessed them. It is not meant that
their fathers, who had been brought up out of Egypt, had, a thousand and five
hundred years after, declared to their posterity the benefits God had conferred
upon them. The import of the language is, that not only the first deliverance,
but that also the various other works which God had wrought from time to time in
behalf of his people, had come down, as it were, from hand to hand, in an
uninterrupted series, even to the latest age. As, therefore, those who, after
the lapse of many ages, became witnesses and heralds of the grace which God had
exercised towards this people, spake upon the report of the first generation,
the faithful are warranted in saying, as they here do, that their fathers have
declared to them that which they certainly knew, because the knowledge of it had
not been lost by reason of its antiquity, but was continually preserved by the
remembrance of it from the fathers to the children. The sum of the whole is,
that God had manifested his goodness towards the children of Abraham, not only
for ten or twenty years, but that ever since he had received them into his
favor, he had never ceased to bestow upon them continued tokens of his
grace.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast expelled the
heathen with thy hand.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is an
illustration of the preceding verse: for the inspired writer had not yet
expressly referred to that work of God, the fame of which had been preserved by
their fathers. He therefore now adds, that God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with his own hand expelled the
heathen</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>in order
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
plant</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>in their room the children of
Abraham: and that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he wasted and
destroyed them, that he might increase and
multiply</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>the seed of Abraham. He
compares the ancient inhabitants of the land of Canaan to trees; for, from long
continued possession of the country, they had, as it were, taken root in it. The
sudden change, therefore, which had happened to them, was as if a man plucked up
trees by the roots to plant others in their stead. But as it would not have been
enough for God's ancient people to have been planted at first in the country,
another metaphor is here added, by which the faithful testify that the blessing
of God had caused this chosen people to increase and multiply, even as a tree,
extending it roots and its branches far and wide, gains still greater strength
in the place where it has been planted. Besides, it is necessary to observe for
what purpose it is that the faithful here magnify this manifestation of the
grace of God. It often happens that our own hearts suggest to us grounds of
despair, when we begin to conclude that God has rejected us, because he does not
continue to bestow upon us the same benefits which in his goodness he vouchsafed
to our fathers. But it were altogether inconsistent, that the faithful here
disposing their hearts for prayer, should allow such an obstacle to prevent them
from exercising the confidence which is proper in prayer. I freely admit, that
the more we think of the benefits which God has bestowed upon others, the
greater is the grief which we experience when he does not relieve us in our
adversities. But faith directs us to another conclusion, namely, that we should
assuredly believe that we shall also in due time experience some relief, since
God continues unchangeably the same. There can be no reason to doubt, that the
faithful now call to remembrance the things which God had formerly done for the
welfare of his Church, with the view of inspiring their minds with stronger
hope, as we have seen them acting in a similar manner in the beginning of the
twenty-second psalm. They do not simply state the comparison, which would tend
to draw a line of separation between those who have in former times been
preserved by the power of God, and those who now labored and groaned under
afflictions; but they rather set forth the covenant of God as the bond of holy
alliance between them and their fathers, that they might conclude from this,
that whatever amount of goodness the Church had at any time experienced in God
pertained also to them. At first, indeed, they use the language of complaint,
asking why it is that the course of God's fatherly favor towards his people is,
as it were, interrupted; but straightway they correct their mistake, and take
courage from a new consideration &#8212; the consideration that God, who had
adopted them as well as their fathers, is faithful and immutable. It is,
however, no great wonder if the faithful, even in prayer, have in their hearts
divers and conflicting affections. But the Holy Spirit, who dwells in them, by
assuaging the violence of their sorrow, pacifies all their complaints and leads
them patiently and cordially to obey. Moreover, when they here say that their
fathers have declared to them the deliverances which God had accomplished in
behalf of his Church, what the fathers did in this respect corresponds with the
precept of the law, by which the fathers were commanded to teach their children.
And all the faithful ought to reflect that the same charge is enjoined upon them
by God even to this day. He communicates to them the doctrine of salvation, and
commits it to their charge for this purpose &#8212; that they may transmit it to
their posterity, and, as much as in them lies, endeavor to extend its authority,
that his worship may be preserved from age to
age.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>.
</i></b><i>For they got not possession of the land by their own
sword.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here the sacred writer confirms
by contrast what he has just said; for if they obtained not possession of the
land by their own power and skill, it follows that they were planted in it by
the hand of another. The multitude of men who went out of Egypt was very great;
but not being trained to the art of war, and accustomed only to servile works,
they would soon have been defeated by their enemies, who far excelled them in
numbers and strength. In short, there were not wanting evident signs by which
the people were made to know as well their own weakness as the power of God; so
that it was their bounden duty to confess that the land was not conquered by
their own sword, and also, that it was the hand of God which had preserved them.
The Psalmist, not content with mentioning
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thy right
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thy
arm</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>to amplify the matter, and give
greater weight to his discourse, that we may know that they were preserved in a
wonderful manner, and not by any ordinary means.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The light of thy
countenance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is here taken, as in other
places, for the manifestation of the divine favor. As, on the one hand, when God
is afflicting us severely, he seems to frown upon us, and to overshadow his face
with thick clouds; so, on the other, when the Israelites, sustained by his
power, overthrew their enemies without any great difficulty, and pursued them in
every direction far and near, it is said, that then they beheld the face of God
serene and placid, just as if he had manifested himself in a visible manner near
them. Here it is necessary to observe the mode of reasoning which the prophet
employs, when he argues that it is by the free gift of God that the people
obtained the land in heritage, seeing they had not acquired it by their own
power. We then truly begin to yield to God what belongs to him, when we consider
how worthless our own strength is. And certainly, the reason why men, as it were
through disdain, conceal and forget the benefits which God has conferred on
them, must be owing to a delusive imagination, which leads them to arrogate
somewhat to themselves as properly their own. The best means, therefore, of
cherishing in us habitually a spirit of gratitude towards God, is to expel from
our minds this foolish opinion of our own ability. There is still in the
concluding part of the verse another expression, which contains a more
illustrious testimony to the grace of God, when the Psalmist resolves the whole
into the good pleasure of God:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hadst a favor for them.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">The prophet does not suppose any worthiness in
the person of Abraham, nor imagine any desert in his posterity, on account of
which God dealt so bountifully with them, but ascribes the whole to the good
pleasure of God. His words seem to be taken from the solemn declaration of
Moses,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The Lord did not set his
love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people;
(for ye were the fewest of all people;) but because the Lord loved you,"<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050707&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
7:7, 8.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Special mention is here made of the
land of Canaan; but the prophet has stated the general principle why it was that
God vouchsafed to reckon that people for his flock and peculiar heritage. And
certainly, the source and origin of the Church is the free love of God; and
whatever benefits he bestows upon his Church, they all proceed from the same
source. The reason, therefore, why we are gathered into the Church, and are
nourished and defended by the hand of God, is only to be sought in God. Nor does
the Psalmist here treat of the general benevolence of God, which extends to the
whole human race; but he discourses of the difference which exists between the
elect and the rest of the world; and the cause of this difference is here
referred to the mere good pleasure of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

express still more plainly what I have already alluded to a little before,
namely, that the goodness of God was not only apparent in the deliverance of his

therefore it is said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou, even

demonstrative pronoun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">awh</font><font face="Palatino">,

the benefits of God after the first deliverance; so that it might appear, that
God, who had once been the deliverer of his people, did not show himself
otherwise towards their posterity: unless, perhaps, it might be considered as
emphatic, and employed for the purpose of asserting the thing stated the more
strongly, namely, that the faithful praise God alone as the guardian of their
welfare to the exclusion of all others, and the renunciation of aid from any
other quarter. Hence they also present the prayer, that God would ordain and
send forth new
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>deliverances</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

and deliverance, he is said to appoint and send forth deliverances as his

him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>

fb135</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The prophet here declares in
what respect God had manifested himself to be the King of this people. He did so
by investing them with such strength and power, that all their enemies stood in
fear of them. The similitude, taken from bulls, which he here uses, tends to
show, that they had been endued with more than human strength, by which they
were enabled to assail, overturn, and trample under foot, every thing which
opposed them. <i>In God, </i>and <i>in the name of God, </i>are of the same
import, only the latter expression denotes, that the people had been victorious,
because they fought under the authority and direction of God. It ought to be
observed, that what they had spoken before concerning their fathers, they now
apply to themselves, because they still formed a part of the same body of the
Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino">And they do this expressly to inspire
themselves with confidence and courage, for had they separated themselves from
their fathers, this distinction would, in a certain sense, have interrupted the
course of God's grace, so that it would have ceased to flow down upon them. But
now, since they confess that whatever God had conferred upon their fathers he
had bestowed upon them, they may boldly desire him to continue his work. At the
same time, it ought to be observed again in this place, that, as I have stated a
little before, the reason why they ascribe their victories wholly to God is,
that they were unable to arrive at such a consummation by <i>their own sword or
their own bow. </i>When we are led to consider how great is our own weakness,
and how worthless we are without God, this contrast much more clearly
illustrates the grace of God. They again declare, (verse 7,) that they were
saved by the power of God, and that he also had chased away and put to shame

part of the psalm. To express the meaning in a few words, they acknowledge, that
in all ages the goodness of God had been so great towards the children of
Abraham, that it furnished them with continual matter of thanksgiving. As if the
thing were still present to their view, they acknowledge that, without ceasing,
they ought to give praise to God, because they had flourished and triumphed, not
merely for one age, or a short period of time, but because they had continued to
do so successively from age to age,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

joy, when it bursts forth in the praises of
God.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb138</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Let us then, in the first place, bear
in mind that this verse relates to the time of joy and prosperity in which God
manifested his favor towards his people; secondly, that the faithful here
manifest that they are not ungrateful, inasmuch as, having laid aside all vain
boasting, they confess that all the victories by which they had become great and
renowned proceeded from God, and that it was by his power alone that they had
hitherto continued to exist, and had been preserved in safety; and, thirdly,
that it was not only once or twice that matter of joy had been afforded them,
but that this existed for a long time, inasmuch as God had manifested towards
them, during a long and uninterrupted period, divers proofs and tokens of his
paternal favor, so that the continuance, and, so to speak, the long experience
they had had of it, ought to have been the means of confirming their
hope.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nevertheless thou hast
abhorred us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here follows a complaint,
in which they bewail their present miseries and extreme calamity. There is here
described such a change as showed not only that God had ceased to exercise
towards them his accustomed favor, but also, that he was openly adverse and
hostile to his people. First, they complain that they have been rejected as
through hatred, for such is the proper import of the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tjnz</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
zanachta, </i>which, along with others, I have translated
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>abhorred</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>If, however, any would rather translate it <i>to forget, </i>or <i>to be
cast off</i>, I have no great objection to it. They next add, that they had been
<i>put to shame, </i>namely, because it must necessarily follow that every thing
should go ill with them when deprived of the protection of God. This they
declare immediately after, when they say, that God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>no longer goes forth with their
armies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> &#8212; </i>goes forth as their
leader or standard-bearer when they go forth to
war.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast made us to turn
back from the enemy.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here the people of
God still further complain, that he had made them to flee before their enemies,
and had given them up as a prey to be devoured by them. As the saints firmly
believe that men are strong and valiant only in so far as God upholds them by
his secret power, they also conclude, that when men flee, and are seized with
trembling, it is God who strikes them with terror, so that the poor wretched
creatures are deprived of reason, and both their skill and courage fail them.
The expression here used is taken from the Law,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;053230&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
32:30, where Moses says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"How should one chase a
thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them,
and the Lord had shut them up?"</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The faithful, fully persuaded of this truth, do not
ascribe to fortune the change which had passed over them, that those who were
wont vigorously and fearlessly to assail their enemies, were now terrified by
their very appearance; but they feel assured that it was by the appointment of
heaven that they were thus discomfited, and made to flee before their enemies.
And as they formerly confessed that the strength which they had hitherto
possessed was the gift of God, so, on the other hand, they also acknowledge that
the fear by which they are now actuated was inflicted upon them as a punishment
by God. And when God thus deprived them of courage, they say that they are
exposed to the will of their enemies; for in this sense I interpret the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wml</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lamo, </i>which I have rendered,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for
themselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>namely, that their enemies
destroyed them at their pleasure and without any resistance, as their
prey.</font><br><font face="Palatino">To the same purpose is that other
comparison, (verse 11) in which they say that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they were given as sheep for
food</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb141</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> By this the prophet intimates, that
being already vanquished previous to the battle, they fell down, as it were,
upon the earth before their enemies, ready to be devoured by
them,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb142</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and not fit for any thing else than to
gratify their insatiable cruelty. It ought to be observed, that when the
faithful represent God as the author of their calamities, it is not in the way
of murmuring against him, but that they may with greater confidence seek relief,
as it were, from the same hand which smote and wounded them. It is certainly
impossible that those who impute their miseries to fortune can sincerely have
recourse to God, or look for help and salvation from him. If, therefore, we
would expect a remedy from God for our miseries, we must believe that they
befall us not by fortune or mere chance, but that they are inflicted upon us
properly by his hand. Having stated that they were thus abandoned to the will of
their enemies, they add, at the same time, that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>scattered among the
heathen:</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>a dispersion which was a
hundred times more grievous to them than death. The whole glory and felicity of
that people consisted in this, that, being united under one God and one King,
they formed one body; and that such being the case, it was a sign that the curse
of God lay heavy upon them to be mingled among the heathen, and scattered hither
and thither like broken
members.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12<i>.</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>Thou hast sold thy people, and not become
rich.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In saying that they were sold without any
gain, it is meant that they were exposed to sale as slaves that are
contemptible, and of no value. In the second clause, too,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And hast not increased the price
of them,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>there seems to be an allusion
to the custom of exposing things to auction, and selling them to the highest
bidder. We know that those slaves who were sold were not delivered to the buyers
till the price of them had been increased by bidding. Thus the faithful mean,
that they were cast out as being altogether worthless, so that their condition
had been worse than that of any
bond-slave.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb143</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And as they rather appeal to God than
turn to their enemies, of whose pride and cruelty they had just cause to
complain, let us learn from this, that there is nothing better, or more
advantageous for us in our adversity, than to give ourselves to meditation upon
the providence and judgment of God. When men trouble us, it is no doubt the
devil who drives them to it, and it is with him we have to do; but we must,
notwithstanding, raise our thoughts to God himself, that we may know that we are
proved and tried by him, either to chastise us, or to exercise our patience, or
to subdue the sinful desires of our flesh, or to humble us and train us to the
practice of self-denial. And when we hear that the Fathers who lived under the
Law were treated so ignominiously, there is no reason why we should lose courage
by any outrage or ill treatment, if God should at any time see meet to subject
us to it. It is not here said simply that God sold some people, but that he sold
his own people, as if his own inheritance were of no estimation in his sight.
Even at this day, we may in our prayers still make the same complaint, provided
we, at the same time, make use of this example, for the purpose of supporting
and establishing our faith, so that, however much afflicted we may be, our
hearts may not fail us. In
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
52:3, God, using the same form of speech, says that he sold his people without
price; but there it is to be understood in a different sense, namely, to show
that he will have no difficulty in redeeming them, because he is under no
obligation to those that bought them, and had received nothing from them in
return.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13<i>.</i>
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast made us a reproach
to our neighbors</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here the Psalmist
speaks of their neighbors, who were all actuated either by some secret ill-will,
or avowed enmity to the people of God. And certainly it often happens, that
neighborhood, which ought to be the means of preserving mutual friendship,
engenders all discord and strife. But there was a special reason in respect of
the Jews; for they had taken possession of the country in spite of all men, and
their religion being hateful to others, so to speak, served as a trumpet to stir
up war, and inflamed their neighbors with rage against them. Many, too,
cherished towards them a feeling of jealousy, such as the Idumeans, who were
inflated on the ground of their circumcision, and imagined that they also
worshipped the God of Abraham as well as the Jews. But what proved the greatest
calamity to them was, that they were exposed to the reproach and derision of
those who hated them on the ground of their worship of the true God. The
faithful illustrate still farther the greatness of their calamity by another
circumstance, telling us, in the last clause of the verse, that they were met by
reproaches on all sides; for they were beset round about by their enemies, so
that they would never have enjoyed one moment of peace unless God had
miraculously preserved them. Nay, they add still farther, (verse 14,) that they
were a <i>proverb, </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a
byword</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or <i>jest, </i>even among the
nations that were far off. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mashal, </i>which is translated <i>proverb, </i>might be taken in the sense
of a <i>heavy imprecation </i>or <i>curse, </i>as well as of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a
byword</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> or jest; </i>but the sense will be
substantially the same, namely, that there were no people under heaven held in
greater detestation, insomuch that their very name was bandied about every where
in proverbial allusions, as a term of reproach. To the same purpose also is
<i>the wagging, </i>or </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shaking of
the head,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which occurs in Psalm 22, of
which we have already spoken. There can be no doubt that the faithful recognised
this as inflicted upon them by the vengeance of God, of which mention was made
in the Law. In order to arouse themselves to the consideration of the judgments
of God, they carefully compared with the threatenings of God all the punishments
which he inflicted upon them. But the Law had declared beforehand, in express
terms, this derision of the Gentiles, which they now relate as a thing that had
come to pass,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;052803&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
28:3.) Moreover, when it is said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>among the
heathen,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>among the
people,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>the repetition is very emphatic
and expressive; for it was a thing quite unseemly and intolerable, that the
heathen nations should presume to torment with their scoffings the chosen people
of God, and revile them by their blasphemies at their pleasure. That the godly
complained not of these things without cause is abundantly obvious from a
passage in Cicero, in his oration in defense of Flaccus, in which that heathen
orator, with his accustomed pride, scoffs no less against God than against the
Jews, asserting that it was perfectly clear that they were a nation hated of the
gods, inasmuch as they had often, and, as it were, from age to age, been wasted
with so many misfortunes, and in the end subjected to a most miserable bondage,
and kept, as it were, under the feet of the
Romans.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;wyhlk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>col-hayom, </i>mean all the day, and denote long continuance: but they may be
understood in two ways, either for the whole or entire day, from morning to
evening, or for continued succession of days. According to either of these
interpretations, the meaning is, that there is no end to their misfortunes. As
to the change of the number from the plural to the singular, it is not at all
inconsistent that what is spoken in the name of the Church should be uttered, as
it were, in the person of one man. The reason is added why they were so
overwhelmed with shame, that they dared not to lift up their eyes and their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>namely, because they had no respite, but were incessantly subjected to the
insolence and reproach of their enemies. Had they been allowed to hide
themselves in some corner, they might have endured, as well as they were able,
their calamities in secret; but when their enemies openly derided them with the
greatest insolence, it served to redouble the wound inflicted upon them. They,
therefore, complain that their calamities had accumulated to such an extent,
that they were forced unceasingly to hear blasphemies and bitter reproaches.
They describe their enemies by the epithet
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>avengers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>a term which, among the Hebrews, denotes barbarity and cruelty, accompanied
with pride, as we have remarked on the 8th
Psalm.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All this has come upon
us, etc.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As they have already attributed
to God all the afflictions which they endured, if they should now say that they
were undeservedly afflicted, it would be the same thing as to accuse God of
injustice; and thus what is here spoken would no longer be a holy prayer, but
rather an impious blasphemy. It is, however, to be observed, that the faithful,
although in their adversities they do not perceive any obvious reason for being
so dealt with, yet they rest assured of this, and regard it as a fixed
principle, that God has some good reasons for treating them so severely. At the
same time, it is proper to observe, that the godly do not speak in this place of
the time past, but rather allege their patient endurance, which was no small
token of their piety, since, in the most humble manner, they thus bowed their
neck to the yoke of God. We see how the great majority of men murmur and
obstinately fret against God, like refractory horses which rage furiously
against their masters, and strike them with their feet. And, therefore, we know
that the man who, in affliction, imposes a holy restraint upon himself, that he
may not by any impatience be carried away from the path of duty, has made no
inconsiderable attainments in the fear of God. It is an easy matter even for
hypocrites to bless God in the time of their prosperity; but as soon as he
begins to deal hardly with them, they break forth into a rage against him.
Accordingly, the faithful declare that, although so many afflictions as they
endured tended to turn them aside from the right path, they did not forget God,
but always served him, even when he did not show himself favorable and merciful
towards them. They do not, therefore, proclaim their virtues in a former and
distant period of their history, but only allege, that even in the midst of
afflictions they steadfastly kept
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the covenant of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is well known, that long before
the persecution of Antiochus, there were many abuses and corruptions which
provoked the vengeance of God against them, so that, in respect of that period,
they had no ground to boast of such integrity as is here described. True it is
that, as we shall very soon see, God spared them, thus showing that they had
been afflicted more for his name's sake than for their own sins; but the
forbearance which God exercised towards them in this respect was not sufficient
to warrant them to plead exemption from guilt. We must, therefore, consider that
in this place they do nothing more than allege their own patience, in that,
amidst such grievous and hard temptations, they had not turned aside from the
service of God. In the first place, they affirm,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have not forgotten
thee:</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for, indeed, afflictions are, as
it were, like so many clouds which conceal heaven from our view, so that God
might then readily slip from our remembrance, as if we were far removed from
him. They add, secondly, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have
not dealt falsely in thy covenant:</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for,
as I have said, the wickedness of men discovers itself more especially when they
are tried more severely than they had anticipated. Thirdly, they declare
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that their heart had not turned
back</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And, lastly, <i>that
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their footsteps declined not
from the paths of God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As God is daily
inviting us, so our hearts must be always ready to proceed in the paths into
which he calls us. Hence follows the direction of our ways; for by our outward
works, and by our whole life, we testify that our heart is unfeignedly devoted
to God. Instead of the translation,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nor have our steps
declined,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which I have given, some
suggest another reading, which is not without some degree of plausibility,
namely, <i>Thou hast made our steps to decline; </i>for, in the first place, the
term
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ft</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>tet, </i>may be so rendered; and, secondly, according to the arrangement of
the words, there is no negative in this clause. As to the meaning, however, I am
not at all of their opinion; for they connect this passage with that in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;236317&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
63:17,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"O Lord, why hast thou
made us to err from thy ways?"</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The complaint which is here made amounts rather to
this, That the faithful are like poor wretched creatures wandering in desert
places, seeing God had withdrawn his hand from them. The expression, <i>The
paths of God, </i>does not always refer to doctrine, but sometimes to prosperous
and desirable events.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19<i>.

sense of <i>although </i>or

what we have already seen, namely, that although plunged into the greatest depth
of miseries, yet they continued steadfast in their resolution, and in the right
way. If we consider the distressing circumstances in which they were placed, it
will not appear to us a hyperbolical mode of speech, when they say that they
were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>broken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

<i>whales,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb148</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as it is also understood in many
other places. This interpretation is obviously confirmed by the following
clause, in which they complain that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they had been covered with the
shadow of death</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which implies that they
were swallowed up of death itself. Let us, however, remember, that in these
words the Holy Ghost dictates to us a form of prayer; and that, therefore, we
are enjoined to cultivate a spirit of invincible fortitude and courage, which
may serve to sustain us under the weight of all the calamities we may be called
to endure, so that we may be able to testify of a truth, that even when reduced
to the extremity of despair, we have never ceased to trust in God; that no
temptations, however unexpected, could expel his fear from our hearts; and, in
fine, that we were never so overwhelmed by the burden of our afflictions,
however great, as not to have our eyes always directed to him. But it is proper
for us to notice still more particularly the style of speaking here employed by
the faithful. In order to show that they still continued steadfastly in the pure
service of God, they affirm that they have not lifted up their hearts or their
hands to any but to the God of Israel alone. It would not have been enough for
them to have cherished some confused notion of the Deity: it was necessary that
they should receive in its purity the true religion. Even those who murmur
against God may be constrained to acknowledge some Divinity; but they frame for
themselves a god after their own pleasure. And this is an artifice of the devil,
who, because he cannot at once eradicate from our hearts all sense of religion,
endeavors to overthrow our faith, by suggesting to our minds these devices
&#8212; that we must seek another God; or that the God whom we have hitherto
served must be appeased after another manner; or else that the assurance of his
favor must be sought elsewhere than in the Law and the Gospel. Since, then, it
is a much more difficult matter for men, amidst the tossings and waves of
adversity, to continue steadfast and tranquil in the true faith, we must
carefully observe the protestation which the Holy Fathers here make, that even
when reduced to the lowest extremity of distress by calamities of every kind,
they nevertheless did not cease to trust in the true
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This they express still more clearly in the
following clause, in which they say,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have not stretched out our
hands</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb149</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to a strange
god.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By these words they intimate, that,
contented with God alone, they did not suffer their hopes to be divided on
different objects, nor gazed around them in search of other means of assistance.
Hence we learn, that those whose hearts are thus divided and distracted by
various expectations are forgetful of the true God, to whom we fail to yield the
honor which is due to him, if we do not repose with confidence in him alone. And
certainly, in the true and rightful service of God, faith and supplication which
proceeds from it hold the first place: for we are guilty of depriving him of the
chief part of his glory, when we seek apart from him in the least degree our own
welfare. Let us then bear in mind, that it is a true test of our piety, when,
being plunged into the lowest depths of disasters, we lift up our eyes, our
hopes, and our prayers, to God alone. And it only serves to demonstrate more
convincingly and clearly the impiety of Popery, when, after having confessed
their faith in the one true God with the mouth, its rotaries the next moment
degrade his glory by ascribing it to created objects. They indeed excuse
themselves by alleging, that in having recourse to Saint Christopher and other
saints of their own making, they do not claim for them the rank of Deity, but
only employ them as intercessors with God to obtain his favor. It is, however,
well known to every one, that the form of the prayers which they address to the
saints,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb150</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is in no respects different from those
prayers which they present to God. Besides, although we should yield this point
to them, it will still be a frivolous excuse to pretend that they are seeking
advocates or intercessors for themselves. This is as much as to say, that Christ
is not sufficient for them, or rather, that his office is wholly lost sight of
among them. Moreover, we should carefully observe the scope of this passage. The
faithful declare, that they did not stretch forth their hands to other gods,
because it is an error too common among men to forsake God, and to seek for
other means of relief when they find that their afflictions continue to oppress
them. So long as we are gently and affectionately treated of God we resort to
him, but as soon as any adversity befalls us we begin to doubt. And if we are
pressed still further, or if there be no end to our afflictions, the very
continuance of them tempts us to despair; and despair generates various kinds of
false confidence. Hence arises a multitude of new gods framed after the fancy of
men. Of <i>the lifting up of the hands </i>we have spoken
elsewhere.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21<i>.</i>
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall not God search this
out?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We have here a solemn and emphatic
protestation, in which the people of God dare to appeal to him as the judge of
their integrity and uprightness. From this it appears, that they did not plead
their cause openly before men, but communed with themselves as if they had been
before the judgment-seat of God; and moreover, as a token of still greater
confidence, they add, that nothing is hidden from God. Why is it that hypocrites
often call God to witness, if it is not because they imagine that, by concealing
their wickedness under some specious disguise, they have escaped the judgment of
God? and thus they would represent the character of God to be different from
what it is, as if by their deceptions they could dazzle his eyes. Whenever,
therefore, we come before God, let us at the same time remember, that there is
nothing to be gained by any vain pretense in his presence, inasmuch as he knows
the heart.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

<div><font face="Palatino">"To this I answer, That although it is the greatest
alleviation of our sorrow that the cause for which we suffer is common to us
with Christ himself, yet it is neither in vain nor out of place that the
faithful here plead with God that they suffer wrongfully for his sake, in order
that he may the more vigorously set himself for their defense. It is right that
he should have respect to the maintenance of his glory, which the wicked
endeavor to overthrow, when they insolently persecute those who serve him. And
from this it appears the more clearly that this psalm was composed when the
people languished in captivity, or else when Antiochus laid waste the Church,
because religion was at that time the cause of suffering. The Babylonians were
enraged by the constancy of the people, when they perceived that the whole body
of the Jews, vanquished and routed as they were, ceased not on that account to
condemn the superstitions of the country; and the rage of Antiochus was wholly
bent upon extinguishing entirely the name of God. Moreover, what made the thing
appear more strange and difficult to bear was, that God, so far from repressing
the insolence and the wrongs inflicted by the wicked, left them, on the
contrary, to continue in their cruelty, and gave them, as it were, loose reins.
Accordingly, the godly declare that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they are killed all the day
long,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and that they are counted of no
more value than </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sheep for
slaughter</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is, however, proper always
to bear in mind, what I have already remarked, that they were not so free from
all blame as that God, in afflicting them, might not justly chastise them for
their sins. But whilst in his incomparable goodness he fully pardons all our
sins, he yet allows us to be exposed to unmerited persecutions, that we may with
greater alacrity glory in bearing the cross with Christ, and thereby become
partakers with him in his blessed resurrection. We have already said, that there
was no other reason why the rage of the enemy was so inflamed against them, but
that the people would not revolt from the law, and renounce the worship of the
true God. It now remains for us to apply this doctrine to our own circumstances;
and, first, let us consider that it becomes us, after the example of the
fathers, patiently to submit to the afflictions by which it is necessary to seal
the confession of our faith; and, secondly, that even in the deepest afflictions
we must continue to call upon the name of God and abide in his fear. Paul,
however, in his Epistle to the Romans, chapter 8:36, proceeds still farther; for
he quotes this not only by way of example, but also affirms that the condition
of the Church in all ages is here portrayed. Thus, then, we ought to regard it
as a settled point, that a state of continual warfare in bearing the cross is
enjoined upon us by divine appointment. Sometimes, it is true, a truce or
respite may be granted us; for God, has compassion upon our infirmity: but
although the sword of persecution is not always unsheathed against us, yet, as
we are the members of Christ, it behoves us always to be ready to bear the cross
with him. Lest, therefore, the severity of the cross should dismay us, let us
always have present to our view this condition of the Church, that as we are
adopted in Christ, we are appointed to the slaughter. If we neglect to do this,
the same thing will befall us which happens to many apostates; for as it is in
their judgment too severe and wretched a state, even while they live, to be
continually dying, to be exposed to the mockery of others, and not to have one
moment free from fear, &#8212; to rid themselves of that necessity they
shamefully forsake and deny Christ. In order, therefore, that weariness, or
dread of the cross, may not root up from our hearts true godliness, let us
continually reflect upon this, that it behoves us to drink the cup which God
puts into our hands, and that no one can be a Christian who does not dedicate
himself to God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23<i>.</i>
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Arise, O Lord! why sleepest
thou?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here the saints desire that God,
having pity upon them, would at length send them help and deliverance. Although
God allows the saints to plead with him in this babbling manner, when in their
prayers they desire him to rise up or awake; yet it is necessary that they
should be fully persuaded that he keeps watch for their safety and defense. We
must guard against the notion of Epicurus, who framed to himself a god who,
having his abode in heaven,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb154</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> delighted only in idleness and
pleasure. But as the insensibility of our nature is so great, that we do not at
once comprehend the care which God has of us, the godly here request that he
would be pleased to give some evidence that he was neither forgetful of them nor
slow to help them. We must, indeed, firmly believe that God ceases not to regard
us, although he appears not to do so; yet as such an assurance is of faith, and
not of the flesh, that is to say, is not natural to
us,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb155</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the faithful familiarly give utterance
before God to this contrary sentiment, which they conceive from the state of
things as it is presented to their view; and in doing so, they discharge from
their breasts those morbid affections which belong to the corruption of our
nature, in consequence of which faith then shines forth in its pure and native
character. If it is objected, that prayer, than which nothing is more holy, is
defiled, when some froward imagination of the flesh is mingled with it, I
confess that this is true; but in using this freedom, which the Lord vouchsafes
to us, let us consider that, in his goodness and mercy, by which he sustains us,
he wipes away this fault, that our prayers may not be defiled by
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25<i>.</i>
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For our soul is humbled to

deplore the greatness of their calamities, and in order that God may be the more
disposed to help them, they declare to him that they are afflicted in no
ordinary manner. By the metaphors which they here employ, they mean not only
that they are cast down, but also that they are crushed and laid upon the earth,
so that they are not able to rise again. Some take the word <i>soul </i>for the
body, so that there would be in this verse a repetition of the same sentiment;
but I would rather take it for the part in which the life of man consists; as if
they had said, We are cast down to the earth, and lie prostrate upon our belly,
without any hope of getting up again. After this complaint they subjoin a
prayer, (verse 26,) that God would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>arise for their
help</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>redeem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>they mean not ordinary kind of help, for there was no other means of
securing their preservation but by redeeming them. And yet there can be no
doubt, that they were diligently employed in meditating upon the great
redemption from which all the deliverances which God is daily effecting in our
behalf, when he defends us from dangers by various means, flow as streams from
their source. In a previous part of the psalm, they had boasted of the
steadfastness of their faith; but to show us that, in using this language, they
boasted not in their own merits, they do not claim here some recompense for what
they had done and suffered for God. They are contented to ascribe their
salvation to the unmerited goodness of God as the alone cause of
it.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
45</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In this psalm, the grace and beauty of Solomon, his
virtues in ruling the kingdom, and also his power and riches, are illustrated
and described in terms of high commendation. More especially, as he had taken to
wife a stranger out of Egypt, the blessing of God is promised to him in this
relationship, provided the newly espoused bride, bidding adieu to her own
nation, and renouncing all attachment to it, devote herself wholly to her
husband. At the same time, there can be no doubt, that under this figure the
majesty, wealth, and extent of Christ's kingdom are described and illustrated by
appropriate terms, to teach the faithful that there is no felicity greater or
more desirable than to live under the reign of this king, and to be subject to
his government.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>To the chief
musician upon the lilies; of the sons of
Korah;</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>for
instruction; a song of loves.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is well known that this psalm was composed
concerning Solomon; but it is uncertain who was its author. It is, in my
opinion, probable, that some one of the prophets or godly teachers (whether
after Solo-men's death, or while he was yet alive, it is of no importance to
inquire) took this as the subject of his discourse, with the design of showing,
that whatever excellence had been seen in Solomon had a higher application. This
psalm is called <i>a song of loves, </i>not, as some suppose, because it
illustrates the fatherly love of God, as to the benefits which he had conferred
in such a distinguished manner upon Solomon, but because it contains an
expression of rejoicing on account of his happy and prosperous marriage. Thus
the words, <i>of loves, </i>are put for a descriptive epithet, and denote, that
it is a love-song. Indeed, Solomon was called
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hydydy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Yedidyah, </i>which means <i>beloved of the Lord,
</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;101225&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 12:25. But the context, in my opinion, requires that this term
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twdyry</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>yedidoth, </i>that is to say, <i>loves, </i>be understood as referring to the
mutual love which husband and wife ought to cherish towards each other. But as
the word <i>loves </i>is sometimes taken in a bad sense, and as even conjugal
affection itself, however well regulated, has always some irregularity of the
flesh mingled with it; this song is, at the same time, called
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lyk&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>maskil, </i>to teach us, that the subject here treated of is not some obscene
or unchaste amours, but that, under what is here said of Solomon as a type, the
holy and divine union of Christ and his Church is described and set forth. As to
the remaining part of the inscription, interpreters explain it in various ways.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;&ccedil;w&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shushan, </i>properly signifies <i>a lily; </i>and the sixtieth psalm has in
its inscription the same term in the singular number. Here, and in the eightieth
psalm, the plural number is employed. It is therefore probable, that it was
either the beginning of a common song, or else some instrument of music. But as
this is a matter of no great consequence, I give no opinion, but leave it
undecided; for, without any danger to the truth, every one may freely adopt on
this point whatever view he
chooses.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

that the subject of the psalm is no common one; for whoever the author of it may
have been, he here intimates, at the very outset, that he will treat of great
and glorious things. The Holy Spirit is not accustomed to inspire the servants
of God to utter great swelling words, and to pour forth empty sounds into the
air; and, therefore, we may naturally conclude, that the subject here treated of
is not merely a transitory and earthly kingdom, but sortie-thing more excellent.
Were not this the case, what end would it serve to announce, as the prophet does
in such a magnificent style, that his heart
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was boiling
over</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>from his ardent desire to be
employed in rehearsing the praises of the king? Some prefer to translate the
word <i>to utter; </i>but the other signification of the word appears to me to
be more appropriate; and it is confirmed by this, that from this verb is derived
the noun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">t&ccedil;hrm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>marchesheth, </i>a word which is found once or twice in Moses, and signifies
a frying-pan, in which sweatmeats are baked. It is then of the same import as if
the inspired writer had said, My heart is ready to breathe forth something
excellent and worthy of being remembered. He afterwards expresses the harmony
between the tongue and the heart, when he compares his tongue to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the pen of a

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>writer</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou art fairer than the
sons of men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist commences his
subject with the commendation of the beauty of the king, and then he proceeds
also to praise his eloquence. Personal excellence is ascribed to the king, not
that the beauty of the countenance, which of itself is not reckoned among the
number of the virtues, ought to be very highly valued; but because a noble
disposition of mind often shines forth in the very countenance of a man. This
may have been the case with Solomon, so that from his very countenance it might
have appeared that he was endued with superior gifts. Nor is the grace of
oratory undeservedly commended in a king, to whom it belongs, by virtue of his
office, not only to rule the people by authority, but also to allure them to
obedience by argument and eloquence, just as the ancients feigned that Hercules
had in his mouth golden chains, by which he captivated the ears of the common
people, and drew them after him. How manifestly does this rebuke the
mean-spiritedness of kings in our day, by whom it is regarded as derogatory to
their dignity to converse with their subjects, and to employ remonstrance in
order to secure their submission; nay, who display a spirit of barbarous tyranny
in seeking rather to compel than to persuade them, and in choosing rather to
abuse them as slaves, than to govern them by laws and with justice as a
tractable and obedient people. But as this excellence was displayed in Solomon,
so also did it shine forth more fully afterwards in Christ, to whom his truth
serves the part of a scepter, as we shall have occasion by and by to notice mere
at large. The term
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;kAl[</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
al-ken, </i>which we have translated
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>is sometimes rendered <i>wherefore; </i>but it is not necessary that we
should interpret it in this place in the latter sense, as if Solomon had been
blessed on account of his beauty and excellence, for both of these are blessings
of God. It is rather to be understood as the reason why Solomon was
distinguished for these endowments, namely, because God had blessed him. As to
the interpretation which others give, <i>God shall bless thee for thy
excellency, </i>it is both cold and
forced.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>Gird thy sword upon thy thigh.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Here Solomon is praised as well for his warlike valor, which strikes terror
into ]his enemies, as for his virtues which give him authority among his
subjects, and secure him their reverence. On the one hand, no king will be able
to preserve and defend his subjects, unless he is formidable to his enemies;
and, on the other hand, it will be to little purpose to make war boldly upon
foreign realms, if the internal state of his own kingdom is not established and
regulated in uprightness and justice. Accordingly, the inspired writer says,
that the sword with which he will be girded will be, in the first place, a token
of warlike prowess to repel and rout his enemies; and, secondly, of authority
<i>also, </i>that he might not be held in contempt among his own subjects. He
adds, at the same time, that the glory which he will obtain will not be a merely
transient thing, like the pomp and vain-glory of kings, which soon decay, but
will be of lasting duration, and will greatly
increase.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He then comes to speak of the virtues
which flourish most in a time of peace, and which, by an appropriate similitude,
he shows to be the true means of adding strength and prosperity to a kingdom. At
first sight, indeed, it seems to be a strange and inelegant mode of expression,
to speak of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>riding upon truth,
meekness, and righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>(verse 4;)
but, as I have said, he very suitably compares these virtues to chariots, in
which the king is conspicuously borne aloft with great majesty. These virtues he
opposes not only to the vain pomp and parade in which earthly kings proudly
boast; but also to the vices and corruptions by which they endeavor most
commonly to acquire authority and renown. Solomon himself</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Mercy and truth preserve
the king;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and his throne is
upholden by mercy."&#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">But, on the contrary, when worldly kings desire to
enlarge their dominions, and to increase their power, ambition, pride,
fierceness, cruelty, exactions, rapine, and violence, are the horses and
chariots which they employ to accomplish their ends; and, therefore, it is not
to be wondered at if God should very often cast them down, when thus elated with
pride and vain-glory, from their tottering and decayed thrones. For kings, then,
to cultivate faithfulness and justice, and to temper their government with mercy
and kindness, is the true and solid foundation of kingdoms. The latter clause of
the verse intimates, that every thing which Solomon undertakes shall prosper,
provided he combine with warlike courage the qualities of justice and mercy.
Kings who are carried headlong with a blind and violent impulse, may for a time
spread terror and consternation around them; but they soon fall by the force of
their own efforts. Due moderation, therefore, and uniform self-restraint, are
the best means for making the hands of the valiant to be feared and
dreaded.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.<i>

he says that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the people shall

duration of his throne, and then the justice and rectitude of his mode of
government. The Jews, indeed, explain this passage as if the discourse were
addressed to God, but such an interpretation is frivolous and impertinent.
Others of them read the word

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;020701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
7:1.) From this we may naturally infer, that this psalm relates, as we shall
soon see, to a higher than any earthly
kingdom.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the next verse there is set before
us a fuller statement of the righteousness for which this monarch is
distinguished; for we are told that he is no less strict in, the punishment of
iniquity than in maintaining justice. We know how many and great evils are
engendered by impunity and license in doing evil, when kings are negligent and
slack in punishing crimes. Hence the old proverb, That it is better to live
under a prince who gives no allowance, than under one who imposes no restraint.
To the same purpose also is the well-known sentiment of
Solomon,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"He that justifieth the
wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the
Lord."&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;201715&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Proverbs
17:15)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Just and rightful government, therefore, consists of
these two parts: first, That they who rule should carefully restrain wickedness;
and, secondly, That they should vigorously maintain righteousness; even as Plato
has well and wisely said, that civil government consists of two parts &#8212;
rewards and punishments. When the Psalmist adds, that the king was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>anointed above his
fellows,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>this is not to be understood as
the effect or fruit of his righteousness, but rather as the cause of it: for the
love of uprightness and equity by which Solomon was actuated arose from the
fact, that he was divinely appointed to the kingdom. In ordaining him to the
honor of authority and empire, Jehovah, at the same time, furnished him with the
necessary endowments. The particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;kAl[</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>al-ken, </i>therefore, as in the former instance, is to be understood here in
the sense of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>as if it had been said, It is no wonder that Solomon is so illustrious for
his love of justice, since, from the number of all his brethren, he was chosen
to be consecrated king by holy anointing. Even before he was born, he was
solemnly named by a divine oracle, as successor to the kingdom, and when he was
elevated to the throne, he was also adorned with princely virtues. From this it
follows, that anointing in respect of order preceded righteousness, and that,
therefore, righteousness cannot be accounted the cause of the anointing. The
royal dignity is called </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the oil
of gladness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because of the effect of
it; for the felicity and welfare of the Church depended upon the kingdom
promised to the house of David.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb159</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">Hitherto, I have explained the text
in the literal sense. But it is necessary that I should now proceed to
illustrate somewhat more largely the comparison of Solomon with Christ, which I
have only cursorily noticed. It would be quite sufficient for the pious and
humble simply to state what is obvious, from the usual tenor of Scripture, that
the posterity of David typically represented Christ to the ancient people of
God; but as the Jews and other ungodly men refuse to submit cordially to the
force of truth, it is of importance to show briefly from the context itself, the
principal reasons from which it appears that some of the things here spoken are
not applicable fully and perfectly to Solomon. As I intimated at the outset, the
design of the prophet who composed this psalm was to confirm the hearts of the
faithful, and to guard them against the terror and alarm with which the
melancholy change that happened soon after might fill their minds. An
everlasting duration, it might be said, had been promised to this kingdom, and
it fell into decay after the death of one man. To this objection, therefore, the
prophet replies, that although Rehoboam, who was the first successor of that
glorious and powerful king, had his sovereignty reduced within narrow limits, so
that a great part of the people were cut off and placed beyond the bounds of his
dominion, yet that was no reason why the faith of the Church should fail; for in
the kingdom of Solomon God had exhibited a type or figure of that everlasting
kingdom which was still to be looked for and expected. In the first place, the
name of king is ascribed to Solomon, simply by way of eminence, to teach us,
that what is here said is not spoken of any common or ordinary king, but of that
illustrious sovereign, whose throne God had promised should endure as long as
the sun and moon continued to shine in the heavens,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197205&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
72:5.) David certainly was king, and so were those who succeeded Solomon. It is
necessary then to observe, that there is in this term some special significance,
as if the Holy Spirit had selected this one man from all others, to distinguish
him by the highest mark of sovereignty. Besides, how inconsistent would it be to
commend very highly warlike valor in Solomon, who was a man of a meek and quiet
disposition, and who having ascended the throne when the kingdom enjoyed
tranquillity and peace, devoted himself only to the cultivation of those things
that are suitable to a time of peace, and never distinguished himself by any
action in battle? But, above all, no clearer testimony could be adduced of the
application of this psalm to Christ, than what is here said of the eternal
duration of the kingdom. There can be no doubt, that allusion is here made to
the holy oracle of which I have already made mention, That as long as the sun
and moon shall endure in the heavens the throne of David shall endure. Even the
Jews themselves are constrained to refer this to the Messiah. Accordingly,
although the prophet commenced his discourse concerning the son of David, there
can be no doubt, that, guided by the Holy Spirit to a higher strain, he
comprehended the kingdom of the true and everlasting Messiah. Besides, there is
the name
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yhla</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Elohim, </i>which it is proper to notice. It is no doubt also applied both to
angels and men, but it cannot be applied to a mere man without qualification.
And, therefore, the divine majesty of Christ, beyond all question, is expressly
denoted here.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb160</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">I now proceed to notice the several
parts, which however I shall only refer to briefly in passing. We have said that
while this song is called a <i>love song, </i>or <i>wedding song,
</i>stilldivine instruction is made to hold the most prominent place in it, lest
our imaginations should lead us to regard it as referring to some lascivious and
carnal amours. We know also, that in the same sense Christ is called "the<i>
</i>perfection of beauty;" not that there was any striking display of it in his
countenance, as some men grossly imagine, but because he was distinguished by
the possession of singular gifts and graces, in which he far excelled all
others. Nor is it an unusual style of speaking, that what is spiritual in Christ
should be described under the form of earthly figures. The kingdom of Christ, it
is said, shall be opulent; and in addition to this it is said, that it shall
attain to a state of great glory, such as we see where there is great prosperity
and vast power. In this description there is included also abundance of
pleasures. Now, there is nothing of all this that applies literally to the
kingdom of Christ, which is separated from the pomps of this world. But as it
was the design of the prophets to adapt their instruction to the capacity of
God's ancient people, so in describing the kingdom of Christ, and the worship of
God which ought to be observed in it, they employ figures taken from the
ceremonies of the Law. If we bear in mind this mode of statement, in accordance
with which such descriptions are made, there will no longer be any obscurity in
this passage. It is also deserving of our notice, that, after the Psalmist has
commended this heavenly king for his eloquence, he also describes him as armed
with <i>his sword. </i>As, on the one hand, he governs by the influence of
persuasion, those who willingly submit to his authority, and manifest docility
of disposition; so, on the other hand, as there have been in all ages, and will
continue to be, many who are rebellious and disobedient, it is necessary that
the unbelieving should be made to feel in their own destruction that Christ has
not come unarmed. While, therefore, he, is alluring us with meekness and
kindness to himself, let us promptly and submissively yield to his authority,
lest he should fall upon us, armed as he is with his sword and with deadly
arrows. It is said, indeed, with much propriety, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>grace is poured into his
lips</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for the Gospel, in its very
nature, breathes the odour of life: but if we are stubborn and rebellious, this
grace will become a ground of terror, and Christ himself will convert the very
doctrine of his salvation into a sword and arrows against us. From this also
there arises no small consolation to us, that the multitude and insolence of the
adversaries of Christ may not discourage us. We know well with what arrogance
the Papists reject Jesus Christ, whom, nevertheless, they boast to be their
King; we know also with what profane contempt the greater part of the world
deride him, and how frowardly the Turks and Jews reproach him. In the midst of
such disorder, let us remember this prophecy, That Christ has no want of a sword
and arrows to overthrow and destroy his enemies. Here I will again briefly
repeat what I have noticed above, namely, that however much the Jews endeavor by
their cavillings to pervert the sense of this verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy throne, O God! is for ever
and ever</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>yet it is sufficient of itself
to establish the eternal divinity of Christ: for when the name
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yhla</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Elohim </i>is ascribed either to angels or men, some other mark is at the
same time usually added, to distinguish between them and the only true God; but
here it is applied to Christ, simply and without any qualification. It is of
importance, however, to notice, that Christ is here spoken of as he
is</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"God manifested in the
flesh,"&#8212;(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;540316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Timothy 3:16.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He is also called God, as he is the Word, begotten of
the Father before all worlds; but he is here set forth in the character of
Mediator, and on this account also mention is made of him a little after, as
being subject to God. And, indeed, if you limit to his divine nature what is
here said of the everlasting duration of his kingdom, we shall be deprived of
the inestimable benefit which redounds to us from this doctrine, when we learn
that, as he is the head of the Church, the author and protector of our welfare,
he reigns not merely for a time, but possesses an endless sovereignty; for from
this we derive our greatest confidence both in life and in death. From the
following verse also it clearly appears, that Christ is here exhibited to us in
the character of Mediator; for he is said
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to have been anointed of
God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>yea, even
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>above his

2:17.) This, however, cannot apply to the eternal Word of God, but to Christ in
the flesh, and in this character he is both the servant of God and our
brother.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

words I am not disposed to contend much, for I find that even the Jews are not
agreed among themselves as to the meaning of the third word, except that from
the similarity of pronunciation it may be conjectured to denote cassia. It is
sufficient that we understand the prophet as meaning that the garments of the
king are perfumed with precious and sweet-smelling odours. He describes Solomon
coming forth from his ivory palace amidst shoutings of universal applause and
joy. I explain not the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ynm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>minni, Out of me, </i>because no tolerable meaning can be drawn from this. I

pleasures cannot be justified, not only in the common people, but not even in
kings; yet, on the other hand, it is necessary to guard against too much
austerity, that we may not condemn the moderate display of grandeur which is
suitable to their dignity, even as, a little after, the prophet describes the
queen sumptuously and royally
apparelled.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb166</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We must, however, at the same time,
consider that all that is here commended in Solomon was not approved of by God.
Not to speak of other things, it is well known that from the very first the sin
of polygamy was a thing displeasing to God, and yet concubines are here spoken
of as included among the blessings of God, for there is no reason to doubt that
by <i>the </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>honorable
women</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>maids of

fb167</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>the prophet means Solomon's
wives, of whom mention is made in another place. The daughter of the king of
Egypt, whom Solomon had married, was his principal wife, and the first in
rank</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb168</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but it appears that the others, whom
sacred history describes as occupying an inferior rank, were provided for in a
liberal and honorable manner. These the prophet calls the<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>daughters of
kings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because some of them were
descended of the royal blood. In what sense, then, it might be asked, does the
prophet account it among the praises of Solomon that he had many wives, &#8212;
a thing which God condemns in all private <i>persons, </i>but expressly in
kings?
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051717&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
17:17.) Doubtless it may easily be inferred that in commending, according to a
common practice, the wealth and glory of the king, as the prophet here does, he
did not mean to approve of the abuse of them. It was not his design to set forth
the example of a man in opposition to the law of God. It is true, indeed, that
the power, dignity, and glory, which Solomon enjoyed, were granted to him as
singular blessings from God; but as generally happens, he defiled them greatly
by not exercising self-control, and in abusing the great abundance with which he
was blessed, by the excessive indulgence of the flesh. In short, it is here
recorded what great liberality God manifested towards Solomon in giving him
every thing in abundance. As to the fact that he took to him so many wives, and
did not exercise a due moderation in his pomp, this is not to be included in the
liberality of God, but is a thing as it were
accidental.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hearken, O daughter! and
consider</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I have no doubt, that what is
here said is spoken of the Egyptian woman, whom the prophet has described as
standing at the right hand of the king. It was not, indeed, lawful for Solomon
to marry a strange woman; but this of itself is to be accounted among the gifts
of God, that a king so powerful as the king of Egypt
was,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb169</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> sought his alliance. At the same time,
as by the appointment of the Law, it was required that the Jews, previous to
entering into the marriage relation, should endeavor to instruct their wives in
the pure worship of God, and emancipate them from superstition; in the present
instance, in which the wife spoken of was descended from a heathen nation, and
who, by her present marriage, was included in the body of the Church, the
prophet, in order to withdraw her from her evil training, exhorts her to forget
her own country and her father's house, and to assume a new character and other
manners. If she did not do this, there was reason to fear, not only that she
would continue to observe in private the superstitions and false modes of
worshipping God to which she had been habituated, but that also, by her public
example, she would draw away many into a similar evil course; and, indeed, this
actually came to pass soon after. Such is the reason of the exhortation which
the prophet here gives her, in which, in order to render his discourse of more
weight, he addresses her by the appellation of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>daughter</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>a term which it would have been unsuitable for any private man to have used.
The more clearly to show how much it behoved the new bride to become altogether
a new woman, he employs several terms thereby to secure her attention,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hearken, consider, and incline
thy ear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is certainly a case in which
much vehemence and urgent persuasion are needed, when it is intended to lead us
to a complete renunciation of those things in which we take delight, either by
nature or by custom. He then shows that there is no reason why the daughter of
Pharaoh should feel any regret in forsaking <i>her father, </i>her kinsfolk, and
the land of Egypt, because she would receive a glorious recompense, which ought
to allay the grief she might experience in being separated from them. To
reconcile her to the thought of leaving her own country, he encourages her by
the consideration that she is married to so illustrious a
king.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Let us now return to Christ. And, in the
first place, let us remember that what is spiritual is here described to us
figuratively; even as the prophets, on account of the dulness of men, were under
the necessity of borrowing similitudes from earthly things. When we bear in mind
this style of speaking, which is quite common in the Scriptures, we will not
think it strange that the sacred writer here makes mention of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ivory palaces, gold, precious
stones</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spices</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>for by these he means to intimate that the kingdom of Christ will be
replenished with a rich abundance, and furnished with all good things. The glory
and excellence of the spiritual gifts, with which God enriches his Church, are
indeed held in no estimation among men; but in the sight of God they are of more
value than all the riches of the world. At the same time, it is not necessary
that we should apply curiously to Christ every particular here
enumerated;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb170</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as for instance, what is here said of
the many wives which Solomon had. If it should be imagined from this that there
may be several churches, the unity of Christ's body will be rent in pieces. I
admit, that as every individual believer is called "the<i> </i>temple of God,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460317&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 3:17, and 6:19,) so also might each be named "the spouse of
Christ;"<i> </i>but properly speaking, there is only one spouse of Christ, which
consists of the whole body of the faithful. She is said <i>to sit by the side of
the king, </i>not that she exercises any dominion peculiar to herself, but
because Christ rules in her; and it is in this sense that she is called "the
mother of us all,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480426&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
4:26.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">This passage contains a remarkable
prophecy in reference to the future calling of the Gentiles, by which the Son of
God formed an alliance with strangers and those who were his enemies. There was
between God and the uncircumcised nations a deadly quarrel, a wall of separation
which divided them from the seed of Abraham, the chosen people,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:14;) for the covenant which God had made with Abraham shut out the Gentiles
from the kingdom of heaven till the coming of Christ. Christ, therefore, of his
free grace, desires to enter into a holy alliance of marriage with the whole
world, in the same way as if a Jew in ancient times had taken to himself a wife
from a foreign and heathen land. But in order to conduct into Christ's presence
his bride chaste and undefiled, the prophet exhorts the Church gathered from the
Gentiles to forget her former manner of living, and to devote herself wholly to
her husband. As this change, by which the children of Adam begin to be the
children of God, and are transformed into new men, is a thing so difficult, the
prophet enforces the necessity of it the more earnestly. In enforcing his
exhortation in this way by different terms,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hearken, consider, incline thy
ear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he intimates, that the faithful do
not deny themselves, and lay aside their former habits, without intense and
painful effort; for such an exhortation would be superfluous, were men naturally
and voluntarily disposed to it. And, indeed, experience shows how dull and slow
we are to follow God. By the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>consider</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>or <i>understand, </i>our stupidity is tacitly rebuked, and not without good
reason; for whence arise that self-love which is so blind, that false opinion
which we have of our own wisdom and strength, the deception arising from the
fascinations of the world, and, in fine, the arrogance and pride which are
natural to us, but because we do not consider how precious a treasure God is
presenting to us in his only begotten Son? Did not this ingratitude prevent us,
we would without regret, after the example of Paul,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;500308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
3:8,) reckon as nothing, or as "dung," those things which we admire most, that
Christ might replenish us with his riches. By the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>daughter</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>the prophet gently and sweetly soothes the new Church; and he also sets
before her the promise of a bountiful
reward,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb171</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to induce her, for the sake of Christ,
willingly to despise and forsake whatever she made account of heretofore. It is
certainly no small consolation to know that the Son of God will delight in us,
when we shall have put off our earthly nature. In the meantime, let us learn,
that to deny ourselves is the beginning of that sacred union which ought to
exist between us and Christ. By her
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>father's
house</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>her
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is<i> </i>doubtless meant all the
corruptions which we carry with us from our mother's womb, or derive from evil
custom; nay, under this mode of expression there is comprehended whatever men
have belonging to themselves; for there is no part of our nature sound or free
from corruption.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is necessary, also, to
notice the reason which is added, namely, that if the Church refuses to devote
herself wholly to Christ, she casts off his due and lawful authority. By the
word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>worship</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>we must understand not only the outward ceremony, but also, according to the
figure synecdoche, a holy desire to yield reverence and obedience. Would to God
that this admonition, as it ought, had been thoroughly weighed! for the Church
of Christ had then been more obedient to his authority, and we should not in
these days have had so great a contest to maintain in reference to her authority
against the Papists, who imagine that the Church is not sufficiently exalted and
honored, unless with unbridled license she may insolently triumph over her own
husband. They, no doubt, in words ascribe supreme authority to Christ, saying,
that every knee should bow before him; but when they maintain that the Church
has an unlimited power of making laws, what else is this but to give her loose
reins, and to exempt her from the authority of Christ, that she may break forth
into any excess according to her desire? I stay not to notice how wickedly they
arrogate to themselves the title and designation of the Church. But it is
intolerable sacrilege to rob Christ and then adorn the Church with his spoils.
It is no small dignity which the Church enjoys, in being seated at the right
hand of the King, and it is no small honor to be called "the Mother" of all the
godly, for to her it belongs to nourish and keep them under her discipline. But
at the same time it is easy to gather from innumerable passages of Scripture,
that Christ does not so elevate his own Church that he may diminish or impair in
the least his own authority.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the daughter of Tyre
with a gift.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This also is a part of the
recompense which the prophet promises to the queen in order to mitigate or
rather to extinguish entirely, the longing desire she might still feel after her
former condition. He says: that the Tyrians will come humbly to pay her
reverence, bringing presents with them. Tyre, we know, was formerly a city of
great renown, and, therefore, he accounts it a very high honor that men will
come from a city so distinguished and opulent to greet her and to testify their
submission to her. It is not necessary for us to examine every word minutely, in
order to apply to the Church every thing here said concerning the wife of
Solomon; but in our own day we realize some happy fruits of this prophecy when
God has so ordered it, that some of the great men of this world, although they
themselves refuse to submit to the authority of Christ, act with kindness
towards the Church, maintaining and defending

fb172</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This verse may be understood in
a twofold sense; either as meaning that the queen, not only when she appears in
public before all the people, but also when sitting in private in her own
chamber, is always sumptuously apparelled; or, that the splendor and gorgeous
appearance of her attire is not merely a thing of display, designed to dazzle
the eyes of the simple, but consists of expensive and really substantial
material. The prophet accordingly enhances the happy and lofty condition of the
queen by the circumstance, that she has not only sumptuous apparel in which she
may appear on particular occasions, but also for her ordinary and daily attire.
Others expound it in this sense, That all her glory consists in the king
inviting her familiarity into his presence; and this opinion they rest on the
ground that immediately after there is a description given of her as passing
into the chamber of the king accompanied with a great and glorious train of
followers. This display of pomp exceeds the bounds of due moderation; but, in
the meantime, we are taught by it, that while the Church is thus richly
apparelled, it is not designed to attract the notice of men, but only for the
pleasure of the King. If in our day the Church is not so richly adorned with
that spiritual beauty in which the glory of Christ shines forth, the fault ought
to be imputed to the ingratitude of men, who either through their own
indifference despise the goodness of God, or else, after having been enriched by
him, again fall into a state of poverty and
want.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16<i>.</i>
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Instead of thy fathers shall
be thy children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This also serves to
show the glory and transcendent excellence of this kingdom, namely, that the
children will not be inferior in dignity to their fathers, and that the nobility
of the race will not be diminished after the death of Solomon; for the children
which shall be born to him will equal those who had preceded them in the most
excellent virtues. Then it is added, that they shall be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>princes in all the
earth,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>because the empire shall enjoy
such an extent of dominion on every side, that it might easily be divided into
many kingdoms. It is easy to gather, that this prophecy is spoken expressly
concerning Christ; for so far were the sons of Solomon from having a kingdom of
such an extent, as to divide it into provinces among them, that his first
successor retained only a small portion of his kingdom. There were none of his
true and lawful successors who attained the same power which he had enjoyed, but
being princes only over one tribe and a half of the people, they were, on this
account, shut up within narrow limits, and, as we say, had their wings
clipped.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon"> fb173
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">But at the coming of Christ, who appeared at
the close of the ancient Church, and the beginning of the new dispensation, it
is an undoubted truth, that children were begotten by him, who were inferior in
no respect to their fathers, either in number or in excellence, and whom he set
as rulers over the whole world. In the estimation of the world, the ignominy of
the cross obscures the glory of the Church; but when we consider how wonderfully
it has increased, and how much it has been distinguished by spiritual gifts, we
must confess that it is not without cause that her glory is in this passage
celebrated in such sublime language. It ought, however, to be observed, that the
sovereignty, of which mention is here made, consists not in the persons of men,
but refers to the head. According to a frequent mode of expression in the Word
of God, the dominion and power which belong properly to the head, and are
applicable peculiarly to Christ alone, are in many places ascribed to his
members. We know that those who occupy eminent stations in the Church, and who
rule in the name of Christ, do not exercise a lordly dominion, but rather act as
servants. As, however, Christ has committed to them his Gospel, which is the
scepter of his kingdom, and intrusted it as it were to their keeping, they
exercise, in some sort, his power. And, indeed, Christ, by his ministers, has
subdued to his dominion the whole world, and has erected as many principalities
under his authority as there have been churches gathered to him in divers
nations by their preaching.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17<i>.</i>
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will make thy name to be
remembered, etc.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This also is equally
inapplicable to Solomon, who, by his shameful and impious rebellion, stained the
memory of his name with disgrace. In polluting by superstitious abominations the
land which was consecrated to God, did he not bring upon himself indelible
ignominy and shame? For this deed alone his name deserves to be buried in
everlasting oblivion. Nor was his son Rehoboam in any degree more deserving of
praise; for through his own foolish presumption he lost the better part of his
kingdom. To find, therefore, the true accomplishment of what is here said, we
must come to Christ, the memory of whose name continues to prosper and prevail.
It is no doubt despised by the world, nay, wicked men, in the pride of their
hearts, even reproach his sacred name, and outrageously trample it under their
feet; but still it survives in its undiminished majesty. It is also true, that
his enemies rise up on all sides in vast numbers to overthrow his kingdom; but
notwithstanding, men are already beginning to bow the knee before him, which
they will continue to do, until the period arrive when he shall tread down all
the powers that are opposed to him. The furious efforts of Satan and the whole
world have not been able to extinguish the name of Christ, which, being
transmitted from one generation to another, still retains its glory in every
age, even as at this day we see it celebrated in every language. And although
the greater part of the world tear it in pieces by their impious blasphemies,
yet it is enough that God stirs up his servants every where to proclaim with
fidelity and with unfeigned zeal the praises of Christ. In the meantime, it is
our duty diligently to use our endeavors, that the memory of Christ, which ought
to prosper and prevail throughout all ages, to the eternal salvation of men, may
never at any time lose any of its renown.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
46</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This psalm seems to be an expression of thanksgiving
rather for some particular deliverance, than for the constant aid by which God
has always protected and preserved his Church. It may be inferred from it that
the city of Jerusalem. when stricken with great terror, and placed in extreme
danger, was preserved, contrary to all expectation, by the unlooked for and
miraculous power of God. The prophet, therefore, whoever composed the psalm,
commending a deliverance so singularly vouchsafed by God, exhorts the faithful
to commit themselves confidently to his protection, and not to doubt that,
relying fearlessly upon him as their guardian and the protector of their
welfare, they shall be continually preserved in safety from all the assaults of
their enemies, because it is his peculiar office to quell all
commotions.</font><br></div>

only two of them, namely, that it was either an instrument of music, or else the
commencement of some common and well known song. The latter conjecture appears
to me the most probable. As to the time when this psalm was written it is also
uncertain, unless, perhaps, we might suppose that it was written when the siege
of the city was suddenly raised by the terrible and sore destruction which God
brought upon the army of Sennacherib,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

Kings 19:35.) This opinion I readily admit, because it accords most with the
whole scope of the psalm. It is abundantly manifest that some favor of God,
worthy of being held in remembrance, such as that was, is here
commended.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
46:1-2	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1</b>. God is our refuge and
strength: he is found an exceeding [or superlative] help in tribulations.

</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God is our refuge and
strength</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here the Psalmist begins with
a general expression or sentiment, before he comes to speak of the more
particular deliverance. He begins by premising that God is sufficiently able to
protect his own people, and that he gives them sufficient ground to expect it;
for this the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hsjm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>machaseh, </i>properly signifies. In the second clause of the verse the verb
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he is
found</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which we translate in the
present, is in the past tense, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he
has been found</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and, indeed, there would
be no impropriety in limiting the language to some particular deliverance which
had already been experienced, just as others also have rendered it in the past
tense. But as the prophet adds the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tribulations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>in the plural number, I prefer explaining it of a continued act, That God
comes seasonably to our aid, and is never wanting in the time of need, as often
as any afflictions press upon his people. If the prophet were speaking of the
experience of God's favor, it would answer much better to render the verb in the
past tense. It is, however, obvious that his design is to extol the power of God
and his goodness towards his people, and to show how ready God is to afford them
assistance, that they may not in the time of their adversities gaze around them
on every side, but rest satisfied with his protection alone. He therefore says
expressly that God acts in such a manner towards them, to let the Church know
that he exercises a special care in preserving and defending her. There can be
no doubt that by this expression he means to draw a distinction between the
chosen people of God and other heathen nations, and in this way to commend the
privilege of adoption which God of his goodness had vouchsafed to the posterity
of Abraham. Accordingly, when I said before that it was a general expression, my
intention was not to extend it to all manner of persons, but only to all times;
for the object of the prophet is to teach us after what manner God is wont to
act towards those who are his people. He next concludes, by way of inference,
that the faithful nave no reason to be afraid, since God is always ready to
deliver them, nay, is also armed with invincible power. He shows in this that
the true and proper proof of our hope consists in this, that, when things are so
confused, that the heavens seem as it were to fall with great violence, the
earth to remove out of its place, and the mountains to be torn up from their
very foundations, we nevertheless continue to preserve and maintain calmness and
tranquillity of heart. It is an easy matter to manifest the appearance of great
confidence, so long as we are not placed in imminent danger: but if, in the
midst of a general crash of the whole world, our minds continue undisturbed and
free of trouble, this is an evident proof that we attribute to the power of God
the honor which belongs to him. When, however, the sacred poet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We will not
fear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he is not to be understood as
meaning that the minds of the godly are exempt from all solicitude or fear, as
if they were destitute of feeling, for there is a great difference between
insensibility and the confidence of faith. He only shows that whatever may
happen they are never overwhelmed with terror, but rather gather strength and
courage sufficient to allay all fear.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Though the earth be moved, and
the mountains fall into the midst of the
sea</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>are hyperbolical modes of
expression, but they nevertheless denote a revolution, and turning upside down
of the whole world. Some have explained the expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the midst of the
sea,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as referring to the earth. I do
not, however, approve of it. But in order more fully to understand the doctrine
of the psalm, let us proceed to consider what
follows.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
46:3-5	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3</b>. Though the waters thereof
roar and rage</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb175</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> tempestuously: though the mountains be
shaken with the swelling thereof. Selah. <b>4</b>. The streams of her river
shall make glad the city of God, the sanctuary of the tabernacles of the Most
High. <b>5</b>. God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God will
help her at the dawn of the
morning.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Though the waters thereof
roar, </i></font><font face="Palatino">etc<i>. </i>This verse ought to be read
in connection with the verse which follows, because it is necessary to complete
the sense, as if it had been said: Though the waters of the sea roar and swell,
and by their fierce impetuosity shake the very mountains &#8212; even in the
midst of these dreadful tumults, the holy city of God will continue to enjoy
comfort and peace, satisfied with her small streams. The relative pronoun
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>her</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>according to the common usage of the Hebrew language, is superfluous in this
place. The prophet intended simply to say, that the small streams of a river
would afford to the holy city abundant cause of rejoicing, though the whole
world should be moved and destroyed. I have already mentioned shortly before how
profitable is the doctrine taught us in this place, that our faith is really and
truly tested only when we are brought into very severe conflicts, and when even
hell itself seems opened to swallow us up. In like manner, we have portrayed to
us the victory of faith over the whole world, when, in the midst of the utmost
confusion, it unfolds itself, and begins to raise its head in such a manner as
that although the whole creation seem to be banded together, and to have
conspired for the destruction of the faithful, it nevertheless triumphs over all
fear. Not that the children of God, when placed in peril, indulge in jesting or
make a sport of death, but the help which God has promised them more than
overbalances, in their estimation, all the evils which inspire them with fear.
The sentiment of Horace is very beautiful, when, speaking of the righteous man
and the man who feels conscious of no guilt, he says, (Car., Lib. iii., Od.

<div><font face="Palatino">But as no such person as he imagines could ever be
found, he only trifles in speaking as he does. Their fortitude, therefore, has
its foundation in the assurance of the divine protection alone, so that they who
rely upon God, and put their trust in him, may truly boast, not only that they
shall be undismayed, but also that they shall be preserved in security and
safety amidst the ruins of a falling world.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The
prophet says expressly, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
city of God shall be glad,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>although it
had no raging sea, but only a gently flowing stream, to set for its defense
against those waves of which he has made mention. By this mode of expression he
alludes to the stream which flowed from Shiloah, and passed through the city of
Jerusalem. Further, the prophet, I have no doubt, here indirectly rebukes the
vain confidence of those who, fortified by earthly assistance, imagine that they
are well protected, and beyond the reach of all danger. Those who anxiously seek
to strengthen themselves on all sides with the invincible helps of the world,
seem, indeed, to imagine that they are able to prevent their enemies from
approaching them, just as if they were environed on all sides with the sea; but
it often happens that the very defenses which they had reared turn to their own
destruction, even as when a tempest lays waste and destroys an island by
overflowing it. But they who commit themselves to the protection of God,
although in the estimation of the world they are exposed to every kind of
injury, and are not sufficiently able to repel the assaults made upon them,
nevertheless repose in security. On this account, Isaiah
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230806&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
8:6) reproves the Jews because they despised the gently flowing waters of
Shiloah, and longed for deep and rapid
rivers.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In that passage, there is an elegant
antithesis between the little brook Shiloah on the one hand, and the Nile and
Euphrates on the other; as if he had said, They defraud God of his honor by the
unworthy reflection, that when he made choice of the city of Jerusalem, he had
not made the necessary provision in respect of strength and fortifications for
its defense and preservation. And certainly, if this psalm was written after the
slaughter and flight of the army of Sennacherib, it is probable that the
inspired writer purposely made use of the same metaphor, to teach the faithful
in all ages, that the grace of God alone would be to them a sufficient
protection, independent of the assistance of the world. In like manner, the Holy
Spirit still exhorts and encourages us to cherish the same confidence, that,
despising all the resources of those who proudly magnify themselves against us,
we may preserve our tranquillity in the midst of disquietude and trouble, and
not be grieved or ashamed on account of our defenseless condition, so long as
the hand of God is stretched out to save us. Thus, although the help of God
comes to our aid in a secret and gentle manner, like the still flowing streams,
yet it imparts to us more tranquillity of mind than if the whole power of the
world were gathered together for our help. In speaking of Jerusalem as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the sanctuary of the tabernacles
of the Most High,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>the prophet makes a
beautiful allusion to the circumstances or condition of that time: for although
God exercised authority over all the tribes of the people, yet he made choice of
that city as the seat of royalty, from which he might govern the whole nation of
Israel. The tabernacles of the Most High were scattered throughout all Judea,
but still it was necessary that they should be gathered together and united in
one sanctuary, that they might be under the dominion of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved. The Psalmist
now</i></font><font face="Palatino"> shows that the great security of the Church
consists in this, that God dwells in the midst of her; for the verb which we
translate, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be
moved</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is of the feminine gender, nor
can it be referred to God, as if it were designed to teach that God is
immovable. The sentence must be explained in this way, The holy city shall not
be moved or shaken, because God dwells there, and is always ready to help her.

protected by the hand of God, we must be concerned above all things that he may
dwell amongst us; for all hope of safety depends upon his presence alone. And he
dwells amongst us for no other purpose than to preserve us uninjured. Moreover,

importunity of our desires, yet he will always come to us seasonably, so as to

</i></b><i>The peoples raged</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Since the
Church of God is never without enemies, and these very powerful, and such as
consequently fight against her with cruel and unbridled fury, the prophet now
confirms from experience the doctrine which he had advanced concerning the
impregnable character of the divine protection. He then deduces from it this
general ground of consolation, That it belongs continually to God to restrain
and quell all commotions, and that his arm is strong enough to break all the
efforts of the enemy. This passage, I admit, might be understood in a more
general sense, as meaning that the city of God is liable to be assailed by many
storms and tempests; but that by the favor of God she is, nevertheless, always
preserved in safety. It is, however, more probable, as I have already said at
the beginning, that the Psalmist is here speaking of some notable deliverance,
in which God had given a striking proof of the power and favor which he
exercises in the constant preservation of the Church. Accordingly, he relates
what had taken place, namely, that the enemies of the Church came with a
dreadful host to waste and destroy it; but that immediately, by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the voice of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>they, as it were,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>melted</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and vanished away. From this we derive an invaluable ground of consolation,
when it is said, That although the whole world rise up against us, and confound
all things by their increased madness, they can be brought to nought in a
moment, as soon as God shows himself favorable towards us. The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>voice of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>no doubt, signifies his will or
command; but the prophet, by this expression, seems to have an eye to the
promises of God, by which he has declared, that he will be the guardian and
defender of the Church. At the same time, let us observe the contrast which is
here stated between the voice of God and the turbulent commotions of the
kingdoms of this world.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah of armies is with
us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this verse we are taught how we
shall be able to apply to our own use the things which the Scriptures everywhere
record concerning the infinite power of God. We shall be able to do this when we
believe ourselves to be of the number of those whom God has embraced with his
fatherly love, and whom he will cherish. The Psalmist again alludes, in terms of
commendation, to the adoption by which Israel was separated from the common
condition of all the other nations of the earth. And, indeed, apart from this,
the description of the power of God would only inspire us with dread. Confident
boasting, then, arises from this, that God has chosen us for his peculiar
people, to show forth his power in preserving and defending us. On this account,
the prophet, after having celebrated the power of God by calling him
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the God of
armies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>immediately adds another
epithet, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the God of
Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>by which he confirms the covenant
made of old time with Abraham, that his posterity, to whom the inheritance of
the promised grace belongs, should not doubt that God was favorable to them
also. That our faith may rest truly and firmly in God, we must take into
consideration at the same time these two parts of his character &#8212; his
immeasurable power, by which he is able to subdue the whole world under him; and
his fatherly love which he has manifested in his word. When these two things are
joined together, there is nothing which can hinder our faith from defying all
the enemies which may rise up against us, nor must we doubt that God will succor
us, since he has promised to do it; and as to power, he is sufficiently able
also to fulfill his promise, for he is the God of armies. From this we learn,
that those persons err egregiously in the interpretation of Scripture, who leave
in entire suspense the application of all that is said concerning the power of
God, and do not rest assured that he will be a Father to them, inasmuch as they
are of his flock, and partakers of the
adoption.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come ye, consider the
works of Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Psalmist seems
still to continue in this verse the history of a deliverance by which God had
given abundant evidence that he is the most efficient and faithful protector of
his Church, that the godly might derive from it both courage and strength to
enable them to overcome whatever temptations might afterwards arise. The
manifestations which God has given of his favor towards us in preserving us,
ought to be kept continually before our eyes as a means of establishing in our
hearts a persuasion of the stability of his promises. By this exhortation we
have tacitly rebuked the indifference and stupidity of those who do not make so
great account of the power of God as they ought to do; or rather, the whole
world is charged with ingratitude, because there is scarcely one in a hundred
who acknowledges that he has abundant help and security in God, so that they are
all blinded to the works of God, or rather wilfully shut their eyes at that
which would, nevertheless, prove the best means of strengthening their faith. We
see how many ascribe to fortune that which ought to be traced to the providence
of God. Others imagine that they obtain, by their own industry, whatever God has
bestowed upon them, or ascribe to second causes what proceeds from him alone;
while others are utterly lost to all sense. The Psalmist, therefore, justly
calls upon all men, and exhorts them to consider the works of God; as if he had
said, The reason why men repose not the hope of their welfare in God is, that
they are indifferent to the consideration of his works, or so ungrateful, that
they make not half the account of them which they ought to do. As he addresses
himself in general to all men, we learn, that even the godly themselves are
drowsy and unconcerned in this respect until they are awakened. He extols very
highly the power of God in preserving his chosen people, which is commonly
despised or not estimated as it ought to be, when it is exercised after an
ordinary manner. He therefore sets before them the desolations of countries, and
marvellous devastations, and other miraculous things, which more powerfully move
the minds of men. If any one would prefer to understand what follows &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He maketh battles to
cease</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> &#8212; </i>of some special help
vouchsafed by God, yet still it must be considered as intended to lead the
faithful to expect as much help from him in future as they had already
experienced. The prophet, it appears, from one particular instance, designs to
show in general how mightily God is wont to defend his Church. At the same time,
it happened more than once, that God quelled throughout the land of Judea all
the dangerous tumults by which it was distracted, and drove away wars far from
it, by depriving the enemies of their courage, breaking their bows, and burning
their chariots; and it is very probable that the prophet, froth a particular
instance, here takes occasion to remind the Jews how often God had disappointed
the greatest efforts of their enemies. One thing, however, is quite certain,
that God is here set forth as adorned with these titles, that we should look for
peace from him, even when the whole world is in uproar, and agitated in a
dreadful manner.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be still, and know that I
am God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Psalmist seems now to turn
his discourse to the enemies of the people of God, who indulge their lust of
mischief and revenge upon them: for in doing injury to the saints they do not
consider that they are making war against God. Imagining that they have only to
do with men, they presumptuously assail them, and therefore the prophet here
represses their insolence; and that his address may have the more weight, he
introduces God himself as speaking to them. In the first place, he bids them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>be still, that they may know that
he is God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for we see that when men are
carried away without consideration, they go beyond all bounds and measure.
Accordingly, the prophet justly requires the enemies of the Church to be still
and hold their peace, so that when their anger is appeased they may perceive
that they are fighting against God. We have in the fourth Psalm, at the fourth
verse, a sentiment somewhat similar, "Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with
your own heart upon your bed, and be still." In short, the Psalmist exhorts the
world to subdue and restrain their turbulent affections, and to yield to the God
of Israel the glory which he deserves; and he warns them, that if they proceed
to act like madmen, his power is not enclosed within the narrow limits of Judea,
and that it will be no difficult matter for him to stretch forth his arm afar to
the Gentiles and heathen nations, that he may glorify himself in every land. In
conclusion, he repeats what he had already said, that God has more than enough,
both of weapons and of strength, to preserve and defend his Church which he has
adopted.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
47</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some think that this psalm was composed at the time
when the temple was dedicated, and the ark of the covenant placed in the
sanctuary. But as this is a conjecture which has little to support it, it is
better, if I am not mistaken, instead of detaining ourselves with this, to
consider the subject-matter of the psalm, and the use to which it ought
especially to be applied. It was no doubt appointed for the stated holy
assemblies, as may be easily gathered from the whole tenor of the poem; and
perhaps it was composed by David, and delivered by him to the Levites, to be
sung by them before the temple was built, and when the ark as yet abode in the
tabernacle. But whoever was its author, he exhorts not only the Israelites, but
also all nations, to worship the only true God. It chiefly magnifies the favor
which, according to the state of things at that time, God had graciously
vouchsafed to the offspring of Abraham; and salvation to the whole world was to
proceed from this source. It however contains, at the same time, a prophecy of
the future kingdom of Christ. It teaches that the glory which then shone under
the figure of the material sanctuary will diffuse its splendor far and wide;
when God himself will cause the beams of his grace to shine into distant lands,
that kings and nations may be united into fellowship with the children of
Abraham.</font><br></div>

</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Clap your hands, all ye
peoples</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As the Psalmist requires the
nations, in token of their joy and of their thanksgiving; to God, to clap their
hands, or rather exhorts them to a more than ordinary joy, the vehemence of
which breaks forth and manifests itself by external expressions, it is certain
that he is here speaking of the deliverance which God had wrought for them. Had
God erected among the Gentiles some formidable kingdom, this would rather have
deprived all of their courage, and overwhelmed them with despair, than given
them matter to sing and leap for joy. Besides, the inspired writer does not here
treat of some common or ordinary blessings of God; but of such blessings as will
fill the whole world with incredible joy, and stir up the minds of all men to
celebrate the praises of God. What he adds a little after, that all nations were
brought into subjection to Israel, must, therefore, necessarily be understood
not of slavish subjection, but of a subjection which is more excellent, and more
to be desired, than all the kingdoms of the world. It would be unnatural for
those who are subdued and brought to submit by force and fear to leap for joy.
Many nations were tributary to David, and to his son Solomon; but while they
were so, they ceased not, at the same time, to murmur, and bore impatiently the
yoke which was imposed upon them, so far were they from giving thanks to God
with joyful and cheerful hearts.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Since, then, no
servitude is happy and desirable but that by which God subdues and brings under
the standard and authority of Christ his Son those who before were rebels, it
follows that this language is applicable only to the kingdom of Christ, who is
called </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a high and terrible
King</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>(verse 2;) not that he makes the
wretched beings over whom he reigns to tremble by the tyranny and violence of
his sway, but because his majesty, which before had been held in contempt, will
suffice to quell the rebellion of the whole world. It is to be observed, that
the design of the Holy Spirit is here to teach, that as the Jews had been long
contumeliously treated, oppressed with wrongs, and afflicted from time to time
with divers calamities, the goodness and liberality of God towards them was now
so much the more illustrious, when the kingdom of David had subdued the
neighboring nations on every sidle, and had attained to such a height of glory.
We may, however, easily gather from the connection of the words the truth of
what I have suggested, that when God is called
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a terrible and great King over
all the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>this prophecy applies to
the kingdom of Christ. There is, therefore, no doubt, that the grace of God was
celebrated by these titles, to strengthen the hearts of the godly during the
period that intervened till the advent of Christ, in which not only the
triumphant state of the people of Israel had fallen into decay, but in which
also the people, being oppressed with the bitterest contumely, could have no
taste of the favor of God, and no consolation from it, but by relying on the
promises of God alone. We know that there was a long interruption of the
splendor of the kingdom of God's ancient people, which continued from the death
of Solomon to the coming of Christ. This interval formed, as it were, a gulf or
chasm, which would have swallowed up the minds of the godly, had they not been
supported and upheld by the Word of God. As, therefore, God exhibited in the
person of David a type of the kingdom of Christ, which is here extolled,
although there followed shortly after a sad and almost shameful diminution of
the glory of David's kingdom, then the most grievous calamities, and, finally,
the captivity and a most miserable dispersion, which differed little from a
total destruction, the Holy Spirit has exhorted the faithful to continue
clapping their hands for joy, until the advent of the promised
Redeemer.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He hath set in order the
people under us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some translate the verb
<i>he hath subjected; </i>and this agrees with the translation which I have
given. Others translate it <i>he hath led, </i>which is somewhat more remote
from the meaning. But to understand the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rbdy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>yadebber, </i>as meaning <i>to destroy, </i>as is done by others, is
altogether at variance with the mind of the prophet; for it is doubtless an
advantageous, joyful, and desirable subjection which is here meant. In the
Hebrew, the verb is in the future tense, <i>he will set in order; </i>and if any
are disposed to prefer retaining it in this tense, I have no great objection to
it. As, however, it is certain that under the figure of the kingdom of David
there is here celebrated the grace of God to come, I have readily adopted that
rendering which has been preferred by other interpreters. Besides, although in
this verse the prophet especially exhorts his own countrymen to gratitude to
God, because, through his favor, they ruled over all people; yet it is certain
that he means, that those also who were subdued are associated with the Jews in
this joy. The body does not differ more from the shadow than the reigned
expressions of joy with which the heathen nations honored David in old time,
differ from those with which the faithful through the whole
world</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb184</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> receive Christ,; for the latter flow
from the willing obedience of the heart. And assuredly, if after the ark was
brought to the temple, there had not appeared hidden under this figure something
far higher, which formed the substance of it:, it would have been as it were a
childish joy to assign to God his dwelling there, and to shut him up within such
narrow limits. But when the majesty of God which had dwelt in the tabernacle was
manifested to the whole world, and when all nations were brought in subjection
to his authority, this prerogative of the offspring of Abraham was then
illustriously manifested. The prophet, then, when he declares that the Gentiles
Will be subdued, so that they will not refuse to obey the chosen people, is
describing that kingdom of which he had previously spoken. We are not to suppose
that he here treats of that secret providence by which God governs the whole
world, but of the special power which he exercises by means of his word; and,
therefore, in order that he may be properly called a King, his own people must
necessarily acknowledge him as such. It may, however, be asked, "Since Christ
has brought the Church under his own authority and celestial power, in what
sense can it be said that the nations are subject to the Jews, seeing we know
that the order of the Church cannot be settled aright, and as it ought to be,
unless Christ the only head stand forth prominently above all, and all the
faithful, from the greatest to the least, keep themselves in the humble rank of
members? Nay, more, when Christ erected his dominion through the whole world,
the adoption, which had before been the peculiar privilege of one people, began
to be the common privilege of all nations; and by this means liberty was granted
to all together, that being united to one another by the ties of true
brotherhood, they should aspire to the celestial inheritance." The answer to
this is easy: When the yoke of the law,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fb185</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
was imposed upon the Gentiles, the Jews then obtained the sovereignty over them;
even as by the word the pastors of the Church exercise the jurisdiction of the
Holy Spirit. For this very reason the Church is called a Queen, and the Mother
of all the godly,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480426&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
4:26,) because divine truth, which is like a scepter to subdue us all, has been
committed to her keeping. Although then the Jews, when the kingdom of Christ
emerged into light, were in a state of wretched and ignominious servitude to
heathen nations, and had been, as it were, their slaves; yet the sovereignty is
truly and justly attributed to them, because God "sent<i> </i>the rod of his
strength out of Zion,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B002&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
110:2;) and as they were intrusted with the keeping of the la their office was
to restrain and subdue the Gentiles by its authority. The only way by which the
rest of the world has been brought into subjection to God is, that men, being
renewed by the Spirit of God, have willingly yielded themselves docile and
tractable to the Jews, and suffered themselves to be under their dominion; as it
is said in another passage,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"In<i>
</i>those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold out of all
languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a
Jew,saying, We will go with you;for we have heard that God is with you,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;380823&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Zechariah

</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He hath chosen our
inheritance for us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The inspired poet
here celebrates more distinctly the special grace which God, in his goodness,
had bestowed upon the chosen and holy seed of Abraham. As he passed by all the
rest of the word, and adopted to himself a people who were few in number and
contemptible; so it was proper that such a signal pledge of his fatherly love
should be distinguished from his common beneficence, which is extended to all
mankind without distinction. The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>chosen</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is therefore peculiarly emphatic, implying that God had not dealt with the
children of Abraham as he had been accustomed indiscriminately to deal with
other nations; but that he had bestowed upon them, as it were by <i>hereditary
</i>right, a peculiar dignity by which they excelled all others. The same thing
is expressed immediately after by the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>glory</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Thus then the prophet enjoins the duty of thanksgiving to God, for having
exalted, in the person of Jacob, his chosen people to the highest degree of
honor, so that they might boast that their condition was distinguished from that
of all other nations. He shows, at the same time, that this was entirely owing
to the free and unmerited favor of God. The relative pronoun
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is put instead of the causal particle
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>or <i>because, </i>as if the Psalmist had attributed the cause of this
prerogative by which they were distinguished to God himself. Whenever the favor
of God towards the Jews is commended, in consequence of his having loved their
fathers, this principle should always be kept in mind, that hereby all merits in
man are annihilated. If all the excellence or glory of the holy patriarch
depended purely and simply upon the good pleasure of God, who can dare to
arrogate any thing to himself as peculiarly his own? If God then has given us
any thing above others, and as it were by special privilege, let us learn to
ascribe the whole to the fatherly love which he bears towards seeing he has
chosen us to be his flock. We also gather from this passage that the grace which
God displays towards his chosen is not extended to all men in common, but is a
privilege by which he distinguishes a few from the great mass of
mankind.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God is gone up with
triumph</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There is here an allusion to
the ancient ceremony which was observed under the Law. As the sound of trumpets
was wont to be used in solemnising the holy assemblies, the prophet says that
God </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>goes
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>when the trumpets encourage and stir
up the people to magnify and extol his power. When this ceremony was performed
in old time, it was just as if a king, making his entrance among his subjects,
presented himself to them in magnificent attire and great splendor, by which he
gained their admiration and reverence. At the same time, the sacred writer,
under that shadowy ceremony, doubtless intended to lead us to consider another
kind of going up more triumphant &#8212; that of Christ when he "ascended up far
above all heavens,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490410&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:10) and obtained the empire of the whole world, and armed with his celestial
power, subdued all pride and loftiness. You must remember what I have adverted
to before, that the name
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is here applied to the ark; for although the essence or majesty of God was
not shut up in it, nor his power and operation fixed to it, yet it was not a
vain and idle symbol of his presence. God had promised that he would dwell in
the midst of the people so long as the Jews worshipped him according to the rule
which he had prescribed in the Law; and he actually showed that he was truly
present with them, and that it was not in vain that he was called upon among
them. What is here stated, however, applies more properly to the manifestation
of the glory which at length shone forth in the person of Christ. In short, the
import of the Psalmist's language is, When the trumpets sounded among the Jews,
according to the appointment of the Law, that was not a mere empty sound which
vanished away in the air; for God, who intended the ark of the covenant to be a
pledge and token of his presence, truly presided in that assembly. From this the
prophet draws an argument for enforcing on the faithful the duty of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>singing praises to
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He argues, that by engaging in this
exercise they will not be acting blindly or at random, as the superstitious,
who, having no certainty in their false systems of religion, lament and howl in
vain before their idols. He shows that the faithful have just ground for
celebrating with their mouths and with a cheerful heart the praises of
God;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb186</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> since they certainly know that he is as
present with them, as if he had visibly established his royal throne among

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of all the
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and thus, while he claims to the
Jews the right and honor of primogeniture, he at the same time joins to them the
Gentiles as associates and partakers with them of the same blessing. By these
words he intimates that the kingdom of God would be much more magnificent and
glorious at the coming of the Messiah, than it was under the shadowy
dispensation of the Law, inasmuch as it would be extended to the utmost
boundaries of the earth. To show the greater earnestness in his exhortation, he
repeats the words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sing praises

fb187</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is put in the singular number
instead of the plural; for he invites to this exercise all who are skillful in
singing. He, no doubt, speaks of knowledge in the art of music; but he requires,
at the same time, the worshippers of God to sing the praises of God
intelligently, that there may not be the mere sound of tongues, as we know to be
the case among the Papists. Knowledge of what is sung is required in order to
engage in a proper manner in the singing of psalms, that the name of God may not
be profaned, as it would certainly be, were there nothing more but the voice
which melts away or is dissolved in the
air.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

is, <i>He hath reigned; </i>but as the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#176;lm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>malach, </i>is in the past tense, which in Hebrew denotes a continued act, we
have translated it, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He hath
obtained the kingdom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The prophet
repeatedly informs us that God reigns over the Gentiles; and from this it is
easy to gather that he here treats of a new and a previously unheard of manner
of reigning. There is an implied contrast between the time of the Law, when God
confined his empire, or kingdom, within the boundaries of Judea, and the coming
of Christ, when he extended it far and wide, so as to occupy the whole world
from one end to the other. The majesty of God sent forth some sparks of its
brightness among the heathen nations, when David made them tributary; but the
prophet could not, on that account, have properly said that God reigned among
them, since they both contemned his worship and the true religion, and also
wished to see the Church completely extinguished. To find the fulfillment of
this prophecy, we must, therefore, necessarily come to Christ. What is added in
the second clause of the verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God sitteth upon the throne of
his holiness,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>may be taken in a twofold
sense. By this form of expression is often to be understood <i>the tabernacle,
</i>or <i>the temple; </i>but it also sometimes signifies <i>heaven. </i>If any
are inclined to explain it of <i>the temple, </i>the meaning will be, That while
God reigned over the whole world, and comprehended all nations under his
dominion, he had established his chief seat at Jerusalem; and it was from thence
that the doctrine of the gospel, by which he has brought under his dominion all
people, flowed. We may, however, very properly take this expression as spoken of
heaven<i>; </i>and thus the sense will be, That God, in stretching forth his
hand to subdue men, and bring them to submit to his authority, evidently shows
that, from his heavenly throne, he reigns over men. Unless he show men his power
and working by signs manifest and near at hand, he is not acknowledged as
Governor of the
world.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9<i>.</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>The princes of the peoples are gathered
together.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Psalmist enriches and
amplifies by various expressions the preceding sentence. He again declares that
the way in which God obtained dominion over the Gentiles was, that those who
before were aliens united in the adoption of the same faith with the Jews; and
thus different nations, from a state of miserable dispersion, were gathered
together into one body. When the doctrine of the Gospel was manifested and shone
forth, it did not remove the Jews from the covenant which God had long before
made with them. On the contrary, it has rather joined us to them. As then the
calling of the Gentiles was nothing else than the means by which they were
grafted and incorporated into the family of Abraham, the prophet justly states,
that strangers or aliens from every direction
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>were gathered
together</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to the chosen people, that by
such an increase the kingdom of God might be extended through all quarters of
the globe. On this account Paul says,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
3:6,) that the Gentiles were made one body with the Jews, that they might be
partakers of the everlasting inheritance. By the abolition of the ceremonies of
the Mosaic economy, "the<i> </i>middle wall of partitions" which made a
separation between the Jews and the Gentiles, is now removed,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:14;) but it nevertheless remains true, that we are not accounted among the
children of God unless we have been grafted into the stock of Abraham. The
prophet does not merely speak of the common people: he also tells us that
princes themselves will regard it as the height of their felicity to be gathered
together with the Jews; as we shall see in another psalm,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;198705&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the people of the God of

meant to attribute to the Jews any superiority which they naturally possess
above others, but that all their excellence depends upon this, that the pure
worship of God flourishes among them, and that they hold heavenly doctrine in
high estimation. This, therefore, is not spoken of the bastard or cast-off Jews,
whom their own unbelief has cut off from the Church. But as, according to the
statement of the Apostle Paul,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:16,) the root being holy, the branches are also holy, it follows that the
falling away of the greater part does not prevent this honor from continuing to
belong to the rest. Accordingly, the "consumption" which, as is stated in the
prophecy of Isaiah, overflowed the whole earth, is called the people of the God
of Abraham, (chapter 10:22, 23.) This passage contains two very important and
instructive truths. In the first place, we learn from it, that all who would be
reckoned among the children of God ought to seek to have a place in the Church,
and to join themselves to it, that they may maintain fraternal unity with all
the godly; and, secondly, that when the unity of the Church is spoken of, it is
to be considered as consisting in nothing else but an unfeigned agreement to
yield obedience to the word of God, that there may be one sheepfold and one
Shepherd. Moreover, those who are exalted in the world in respect of honors and
riches, are here admonished to divest themselves of all pride, and willingly and
submissively to bear the yoke in common with others, that they may show
themselves the obedient children of the
Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What follows immediately after,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The shields of the earth are
God's</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is understood by many as spoken
of princes.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb189</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I admit that this metaphor is of
frequent occurrence in Scripture, nor does this sense seem to be unsuitable to
the scope of the passage. It is as if the prophet had said, It is in the power
of God to ingraft into his Church the great ones of the world whenever he
pleases; for he reigns over them also. Yet the sense will be more simple if we
explain the words thus: That, as it is God alone who defends and preserves the
world, the high and supreme majesty, which is sufficient for so exalted and
difficult a work as the preservation of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>world</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>is justly looked upon with admiration. The sacred writer expressly uses the
word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shields</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>in the plural number, for, considering the various and almost innumerable
dangers which unceasingly threaten every part of the world, the providence of
God must necessarily interpose in many ways, and make use, as it were, of many
bucklers.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
48</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In this psalm there is celebrated some notable
deliverance of the city of Jerusalem at a time when many kings had conspired to
destroy it. The prophet, (whoever was the author of the psalm,) after having
given thanks to God for this deliverance, takes occasion from thence to extol in
magnificent terms the happy state of that city, seeing it had God for its
continual guardian and protector. It would not have been enough for the people
of God to have felt and acknowledged that they were once preserved and defended
by the power of God, had they not at the same time been assured of being also
preserved and protected by the same God in the time to come, because he had
adopted them for his peculiar people. The prophet, therefore, chiefly insists
upon this point, that it was not in vain that the sanctuary of God was erected
upon mount Zion, but that his name was there called upon in order that his power
might be conspicuously manifested for the salvation of his people. It is easy to
gather from the subject-matter of the psalm that it was composed after the death
of David. I indeed admit that among David's enemies there were some foreign
kings, and that it was not for want of will on their part that the city of
Jerusalem was not utterly destroyed; but we do not read that they ever proceeded
the length of besieging it, and reducing it to such extremity as to render it
necessary that their efforts should be repressed by a wonderful manifestation of
the power of God. It is more probable that the psalm is to be referred to the
time of king Ahaz, when the city was besieged and the inhabitants brought to the
point of utter despair, and when, nevertheless, the siege was suddenly raised,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 16:5;) or else to the time of Jehoshaphat and Asa,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;141409&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 14:9; and 20:2;) for we know that under their reigns Jerusalem was
preserved from utter destruction only by miraculous aid from heaven. This we are
to regard as certain, that the Psalmist here exhibited to true believers an
example of the favor of God towards them, from which they had reason to
acknowledge that their condition was happy, seeing God had chosen for himself a
dwelling-place upon mount Zion, that from thence he might preside over them for
their good and safety.</font><br></div>

</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Great is Jehovah, and
greatly to be praised.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The prophet,
before proceeding to make mention of that special example of the favor of God
towards them, to which I have adverted, teaches in general that the city of
Jerusalem was happy and prosperous, because God had been graciously pleased to
take upon him the charge of defending and preserving it. In this way he
separates and distinguishes the Church of God from all the rest of the world;
and when God selects from amongst the whole human race a small number whom he
embraces with his fatherly love, this is an invaluable blessing which he bestows
upon them. His wonderful goodness and righteousness shine forth in the
government of the whole world, so that there is no part of it void of his
praise, but we are everywhere furnished with abundant matter for praising him.
Here, however, the inspired poet celebrates the glory of God which is manifested
in the protection of the Church. He states, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah is great, and greatly to
be praised</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>in the holy city. But is he
not so also in the whole world? Undoubtedly he is. As I have said, there is not
a corner so hidden, into which his wisdom, righteousness, and goodness, do not
penetrate; but it being his will that they should be manifested chiefly and in a
particular manner in his Church, the prophet very properly sets before our eyes
this mirror, in which God gives a more clear and vivid representation of his
character. By calling Jerusalem
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the holy
mountain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he teaches us in one word, by
what right and means it came to be in a peculiar manner the city of God. It was
so because the ark of the covenant had been placed there by divine appointment.
The import of the expression is this: If Jerusalem is, as it were, a beautiful
and magnificent theater on which God would have the greatness of his majesty to
be beheld, it is not owing to any merits of its own, but because the ark of the
covenant was established there by the commandment of God as a token or symbol of
his peculiar favor.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Beautiful for situation,
the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>For the confirmation of the statement made in the preceding sentence, the
prophet celebrates the excellencies for which mount Zion was at that time
renowned; and in them was to be seen the glory of God, of which I have just now
spoken. The beauty of its situation, which he mentions in the first place, was
indeed natural; but by it he gives us to understand, that from the very
commencement the agreeable appearance of the city had engraven upon it marks of
the favor of God, so that the sight of it alone showed that God had in a special
manner adorned and enriched that place, with the view of its being, at some
future period, consecrated to sacred purposes. I do not, however, think that the
situation is called beautiful and pleasant, merely because it was unequalled in
the country of Judea; for there were other cities, as is well known, which were
in no respect inferior to Jerusalem, either as to fertility or pleasantness of
situation, and other advantages. In my opinion, along with the situation of the
city, the Psalmist comprehends the glory which it derived from another source
&#8212; from the circumstance that the temple of God was built there. When,
therefore, we hear the beauty of the city here celebrated, let us call to our
remembrance that spiritual beauty which was added to the natural beauty of the
place, after the prophecy was given forth that the ark would there abide for
ever. With respect to the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">pwn</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
noph, </i>which I have translated
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>situation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>commentators are not agreed. Some understand it as meaning <i>height </i>or
<i>elevation, </i>as if it had been said that Jerusalem was situated on high and
elevated ground. Others render it<i>
climate</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb190</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>because the Jews metaphorically
call climates <i>branches,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb191</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>on account of the extent to
which they are spread out. In a matter like this, which is of no great
consequence, I am not disposed to be so very critical. Only I have selected that
translation which seemed to me the most probable, namely, that the country in
its appearance was pre-eminently pleasant and delightful. When the Psalmist
speaks of mount Zion being </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on the
sides of the north</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it is doubtful
whether he lays it down as a commendation of mount Zion, that it lay or looked
towards the north; or whether we should explain the sentence thus: Although
mount Zion looks towards the north, that does not in any degree diminish its
beauty. The former interpretation, however, seems to me to give the more natural
meaning. We find the prophet Isaiah, with the view also of touching upon the
excellence of this mountain, applying to it the very expression which is here
employed. In the 14th chapter of his Prophecies, at the 13th verse, he
represents Sennacherib as speaking thus: "I will ascend into heaven, I will
exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the
congregation, in the sides of the north."</font><br><font face="Palatino">The
Psalmist, in the next place, calls mount Zion
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the joy of the whole
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And he thus describes it, not
only because, as the Jews foolishly talk, that country was healthy on account of
the mildness of the climate; or because it produced sweet and excellent fruits,
which might gratify ard yield delight to foreign nations &#8212; for this also
is a cold and unsatisfactory speculation; &#8212; but because from thence
salvation was to issue forth to the whole world, even as all nations have
borrowed from thence the light of life, and the testimony of heavenly grace. If
the joy which men experience and cherish is without God, the issue of their joy
at length will be destruction, and their laughter will be turned into gnashing
of teeth. But Christ appeared with his Gospel out of Zion, to fill the world
with true joy and everlasting felicity. In the time of the prophet, the
knowledge of the Gospel, it is true, had not yet reached foreign nations; but he
makes use of this manner of expression with the highest propriety, to teach the
Jews that true blessedness was to be sought for only from the gracious covenant
of God, which was deposited in that holy place. At the same time also, he has
foretold that which was at length fulfilled in the last time by the coming of
Christ. From this we may learn, that to cause the hearts of the godly to
rejoice, the favor of God alone abundantly suffices; as, on the contrary, when
it is withdrawn, all men must inevitably be thrown into a state of wretchedness
and sorrow. What is added immediately after, concerning
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the city of the great
King</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is intended to show, that mount
Zion was not only holy itself, but that this high prerogative had been conferred
upon it to render sacred the whole city, where God had chosen his seat, that he
might rule over all people.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God in her palaces is
known for a defense</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here the sacred
poet again brings forward, for the purpose of setting forth the dignity of the
city of Jerusalem, the protection which God afforded it; as we have seen in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;194605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
46:5,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He expressly makes mention of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>palaces</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>for the sake of contrast &#8212; to teach the Jews, that although the holy
city was fortified by strong towers, and had within it magnificent houses, and
such as resembled fortresses, yet its continued safety was owing to the power
and aid of God alone. By these words, the people of God are taught, that
although they dwell in strongholds and palaces, they must, nevertheless, be
carefully on their guard, that this magnificence or loftiness may not shroud or
conceal from their view the power of God; and that they be not like worldly men,
who, resting satisfied with riches and earthly means of help, set no value
whatever upon having God for their guardian and protector. Worldly wealth, from
our natural perverseness, tends to dazzle our eyes, and to make us forget God,
and, therefore, we ought to meditate with special attention upon this doctrine,
That whatever we possess, which seems worthy of being prized, must not be
permitted to obscure the knowledge of the power and grace of God; but that, on
the contrary, the glory of God ought always clearly to shine forth in all the
gifts with which he may be pleased to bless and adorn us; so that we may account
ourselves rich and happy in him, and no where
else.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

of which I have spoken is touched upon. The prophet relates how, when the kings
were assembled together to destroy Jerusalem, their efforts passed away without
producing any effect, even as clouds in the atmosphere vanish away; yea, he
tells us, that by a simple look at the city, they were defeated and undone, and
that not after an ordinary manner, but like a woman who, when the hour of
child-birth has come upon her, finds herself suddenly afflicted with pain and
sorrow. We cannot affirm with certainty what particular part of Jewish history
the prophet here speaks of; but the statements made suit very well both the time
of Ahaz, and that of Hezekiah or Asa. It was indeed a wonderful work of God,
when two very powerful kings &#8212; the king of Syria and the king of Israel,
accompanied with an immense army &#8212; had smitten the city with such terror,
that the king and his people were brought to the brink of despair, to see this
formidable host suddenly routed and disappointed of the certain expectation
which they entertained of making themselves masters of the city. Hence the
prophet
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230704&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
7:4 ironically calls them "smoking firebrands," because they were, so to speak,
burning torches to kindle and consume by fire the whole country of Judea. Nor
was the destruction of the countless host of Sennacherib in one night by an
angel, without the intervention of man's agency, a less stupendous miracle,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121935&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 19:35;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233736&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
37:36.) In like manner, when the king of Ethiopia gathered together an army of
ten hundred thousand men, and came to besiege Jerusalem, the overthrow of so
great a host was a memorable instance of the power of God,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;141409&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 14:9.) But whatever was the occasion on which this psalm was
composed, the sacred writer informs us that the Jews found from manifest
experience that God was the guardian and protector of the holy city, when he
opposed himself to the invincible power of their enemies. He first declares that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the kings
assembled</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By these words he intimates
that they had confederated and conspired together to destroy the Church. The
expression, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>passed away
together</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>may be explained in two ways;
either as meaning that the armies when they had gathered themselves together
were reduced to nothing, or that they undertook together, and with one consent,
the expedition, as it were marshalled in battle
array.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This second sense seems to me the most
suitable to the scope of the passage; for it follows immediately after in the
fifth verse, that they stood stricken with astonishment whenever they saw the
city; and yet there will be no impropriety in understanding this verse as added
by way of amplification. But as it affects very little the substance of the
passage which of these two interpretations is adopted, I leave the reader to
choose that which he considers the most appropriate. When the Psalmist says that
upon beholding the city </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they
marvelled</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>were

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and were seized with sorrow,
like the pangs of a woman in travail</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> &#8212;
</i>he<i> </i>heaps together as many and varied expressions as possible, in
order to set forth the greatness of the miracle which God had wrought in the
overthrow of such a vast and formidable host. The language should be resolved
thus: As soon as they saw the city they marvelled. It is related of Caesar in
ancient times, that when speaking of the ease with which he subdued Egypt, he
made use of the laconic saying, "I came, I saw, I conquered;" but the prophet
here states, on the contrary, that the ungodly were struck with amazement at the
mere sight of the city, as if God had dazzled their eyes with the splendor of
his glory. The particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;k</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ken,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>so</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>is put as it were to show the thing by pointing to it with the finger. In
the verse which immediately follows, the adverb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>sham,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>is used in the same sense. The comparison of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a woman in
travail</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is intended to express the
sudden change which came upon the enemies of Israel. It afforded a more bright
and illustrious manifestation of the grace of God, that they were seized with a
fear which they had not anticipated, lost their courage all at once, and from
the height of secure and presumptuous pride, instantly fell into such a state of
terror, and were so confounded, that they precipitately betook themselves to
flight.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb193</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> From this passage we are taught that it
is no uncommon thing, if in our day the Church is assailed by powerful
adversaries, and has to sustain dreadful assaults; for it has been God's usual
way from the beginning thus to humble his own people, in order to give more
irrefragable and striking proofs of his wonderful power. At the same time, let
us remember that a nod alone on the part of God is sufficient to deliver us; and
that, although our enemies may be ready to fall upon us on every side to
overwhelm us, it is in his power, whenever he pleases, to strike them with
amazement of spirit, and thus to make their hearts fail in a moment in the very
midst of their efforts against us. Let this reflection serve as a bridle to keep
our minds from being drawn away, to look in all directions for human
aid.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.<i>

natural sense, which is simply this, that the enemies of the Church were
overthrown and plunged into destruction, just as God by suddenly raising storms
sinks the ships of Cilicia to the bottom of the sea. The Psalmist celebrates the
power which God is accustomed to display in great and violent storms; and his
language implies that it is not to be wondered at if God, who breaks by the
violence of the winds the strongest
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ships</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

be restricted to one city of the country. But as the chief part of the naval

distance and less known.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

this passage may be understood, either of which is suitable. The first is, that
the sacred writer, speaking in the name of true believers, declares that the
same power which God in the days of old had displayed in delivering their
fathers, he now exercised towards their posterity. They had heard from the mouth
of their fathers, and had learned from sacred history, how God in his great
mercy and fatherly goodness had succoured his Church; but now they affirm that
they can bear testimony to this not only from their having heard it spoken
about, but also from having seen it,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb196</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> inasmuch as they had actually
experienced the same mercy exercised by God towards themselves. The amount of
what is stated then is, that the faithful not only had a record of the goodness
and power of God in histories, but that they also felt by actual experience,
yea, even saw with their eyes, what they knew before by hearsay, and the report
of their fathers; and that therefore God continues unchangeably the same,
confirming as he does, age after age, the examples of his grace exhibited in
ancient times, by renewed and ever-recurring experiences. The other sense is
somewhat more refined; and yet it is very suitable, namely, That God actually
performed what he had promised to his people; as if the faithful had said, that
what they had before only heard of was now exhibited before their eyes. As long
as we have only the bare promises of God, his grace and salvation are as yet
hidden in hope; but when these promises are actually performed, his grace and
salvation are clearly manifested. If this interpretation is admitted, it
contains the rich doctrine, that God does not disappoint the hope which he
produces in our minds by means of his word, and that it is not His way to be
more liberal in promising than faithful in performing what he has promised. When
it is said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
or <i>as to, </i>or <i>with respect to the city. </i>The prophet does not mean
to say that in Jerusalem the faithful were informed that God would succor his
servants, although this was no doubt true, but that God from the beginning had
been the gracious and faithful guardian of his own city, and would continue
always to be so. Mention is expressly made of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the city of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because he has not promised to
extend the same protecting care to all indiscriminately, but only to his chosen
and peculiar people. The name
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah of
armies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is employed to express the power
of God; but immediately after the faithful add, that he is <i>their God, </i>for
the purpose of pointing to their adoption, that thus they may be emboldened to
trust in him, and thus to betake themselves freely and familiarly to him. In the
second Council of Nice, the good fathers who sat there wrested this passage to
prove that it is not enough to teach divine truth in churches, unless there are
at the same time pictures and images for confirming it. This was a piece of
silliness very shameful, and unworthy of being mentioned, were it not that it is
profitable for us to understand that those who purposed to infect the Church of
God with such a corruption, were horribly stricken with a spirit of giddiness
and stupidity.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The concluding clause of the
verse distinguishes Jerusalem from all the other cities of the world, which are
subject to vicissitudes, and flourish only for a time. As Jerusalem was founded
by God, it continued steadfast and unmoved amidst the varied commotions and
revolutions which took place in the world; and it is not to be wondered at, if
he continued through successive ages to maintain the city of which he made
choice, and in which it was his will that his name should be called upon for
ever. It may, however, be objected, that this city was once destroyed, and the
people carried into captivity. But this does not militate against the statement
here made; for, before that event happened, the restoration of the city was
foretold by
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;242722&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
27:22; and, therefore, when it took place, God truly, and in a special manner,
showed how steadfast his work was. And now, since Christ by his coming has
renewed the world, whatever was spoken of that city in old time belongs to the
spiritual Jerusalem, which is dispersed through all the countries of the world.
Whenever, therefore, our minds are agitated and perplexed, we should call to
remembrance the truth, that, whatever dangers and apprehensions may threaten us,
the safety of the Church which God has established, although it may be sorely
shaken, can never, however powerfully assaulted, be so weakened as to fall and
be involved in ruin. The verb, which is in the future tense,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will
establish</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>may be resolved into the past
tense, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>has
established</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but this will make no
difference as to the sense.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O God! we have waited for
thy mercy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This verse teaches us that
the faithful were preserved by the power of God; for, when all things were in a
state of the greatest confusion, they continued tranquil and patient until God
at length, having pity upon them, brought them help. The Hebrew word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;md</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
damam, </i>which we have rendered <i>to wait, </i>properly signifies <i>to be
silent, </i>and is here used to denote tranquillity of mind. From this we
conclude, that the people of God were so harassed with dangers, that, had they
listened to the judgment of carnal sense and reason, they would have been
overwhelmed with terror; even as we know that men are in a state of continual
uneasiness, and are driven hither and thither by contrary waves, until faith
tranquillise their minds, and settle them in true patience. The amount of what
the Psalmist says is, that the faithful, although severely afflicted, were not
driven from their purpose, and prevented from relying upon the aid of God; but
that, on the contrary, by their patience and hope, they opened the gate of his
grace. It served to magnify and illustrate the greatness of the grace of God,
that their expectations of assistance from him were not disappointed. From this
we may also deduce the profitable warning, that if the aid of God is withdrawn
from us, it is because we distrust his promises, and, by our impatience, prevent
his grace, which is laid up for those who wait in patience, from flowing upon
us. But what is meant by the expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the midst of the
temple?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Is it that the people of God
maintained their faith only in that place, and that each of them ceased to hope
as soon as he returned to his own dwelling? No; on the contrary, it is certain
that they carried home with them the hope which they had entertained in the
temple, that they might continue steadfastly to abide by it. But God having
promised that this place, in which he would be called upon, would be the seat
and dwelling-place of his power and grace, his people here affirm, that, relying
upon this heavenly promise, they were persuaded beyond all doubt that God would
show himself merciful and gracious towards them, since they had a real and sure
pledge of his presence. We must not conceive, merely because our own fancy
suggests it, that God will be our deliverer. We are to believe that he will be
so only in so far as he freely and willingly offers himself to us in this
character. Now, if this symbol or pledge of the presence of God, which was only
a shadow, ought to have had such influence upon the minds of true believers
under the former dispensation, as to make them hope for life in the midst of
death, surely when Christ has now descended amongst us, to unite us much more
closely to his Father, we have sufficient ground for continuing in a state of
undisturbed tranquillity, although the world should be embroiled in confusion
and turned upside down. Only it must be our endeavor that the service of God may
flourish pure and entire amongst us, and that thus the glory of his temple may
shine forth in the midst of us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As is thy name, O God! so is
thy praise</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some connect this verse with
the preceding sentence, as if it had been said, Lord, it is not in vain that
thou hast enjoined upon us the duty of celebrating thy name; for thou furnishest
at the same time matter of praise. Thus the sense will be, that the name of God
is magnified and extolled with effect, or that along with his promises his power
is at the same time manifested. Others give this exposition, which is somewhat
more refined, That the works of God correspond with his name; for in Hebrew he
is called,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">la</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>El,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb197</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>from his power, and he shows in
very deed that this name is not applied to him in vain, but that the praise
which is ascribed to him by it is right and what is due to him. The former
exposition, as it is less forced, so it comes nearer to the words and mind of
the sacred writer, namely, that God bore testimony by his works that it was not
in vain that he was acknowledged and worshipped by the Jews as the true and only
God. Yet when I come to consider the words which follow immediately after,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Unto the ends of the
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>I think that the prophet meant
something else, &#8212; that he intended to show, that wherever the fame of the
name of God may be spread, men will know that he is worthy of the highest
praise. The words contain a tacit contrast. At that time, the names of idols, it
is well known, were very common, and had sway through the whole world; and yet,
whatever fame these counterfeit gods had acquired, we know that praise in no
respect belonged to them, since no sign of divinity whatever could be discovered
about them. But here the prophet, on the contrary, declares, Lord, in whatever
part of the world thy name is heard, it will always be accompanied with solid
and rightful praise, or it will ever carry along with it matter of praise, since
the whole world will understand how thou hast dealt with thy chosen people. What
is added immediately after is to the same purpose,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy right hand is full of
righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>teaching us, that God, in
succouring his own people, clearly manifests his righteousness, as if he
stretched forth his arm to us that we might touch his righteousness with the
finger; and that he shows not only one specimen or two of his righteousness, but
in every thing and every where exhibits to us a complete proof of it. We ought
to bear in mind what we have stated elsewhere, that <i>the righteousness of God
</i>is to be understood of his faithfulness which he observes in maintaining and
defending his own people. From this there accrues to us the inestimable comfort,
that the work in which God especially desires to be acknowledged as righteous
consists in providing what belongs to our welfare and to our maintenance in
safety.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb198</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We now see that the meaning of the
inspired poet is, That the names of false gods prevailed, and were renowned
among men, although they had done nothing to furnish matter of true praise; but
that it was altogether different with respect to the God of Israel: for wherever
the report of him was carried, all would understand that he was the deliverer of
his people, and that he did not disappoint their hope and desires, nor forsake
them in danger.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Encompass Zion,
etc</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here the prophet again commends the
situation and beauty of Jerusalem, intimating that the city was strongly
fortified and impregnable; and he does this, because in these external things
the blessing of God in some respect shone forth. We must always bear in mind
what he stated in a preceding verse, that "God in her palaces is known for a
fortress." In making mention here of her
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>towers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>walls</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>we are not to suppose that he would have the minds of the faithful to rest
in these things. He rather sets them before us as a mirror in which the
character of God may be seen. He therefore says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Encompass
Zion</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Fuchsia">fb204</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>that is, look upon it carefully and attentively on every side<i>; &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>number her towers, and apply
your mind to consider her walls</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that
is, estimate her palaces as they deserve, and thus it will be manifest beyond
all doubt that this is a city chosen of God, seeing it far surpasses all other
cities. In insisting upon these points, his whole drift is to make manifest the
character with which the Lord had invested Jerusalem in making it a sacred
place, in which he himself might take up his abode, and in erecting it as a
dwelling-place for his people. It seems, moreover, that the prophet, in stating
that the object of his exhortation was, that the beauty and magnificence of the
holy city <i>might be reported </i>to the succeeding generation, tacitly gives
us to understand, that the time would at length come when that city would be no
longer seen. What need would there be for making this report if it could be seen
and were always before the eyes of the world? Although, then, he has said a
little before that Jerusalem is established for ever, yet he now teaches us, by
way of correction, what kind of perpetuity it will be &#8212; that it will
endure only till the time of the renovation of the Church. We belong to that
generation to come, to whom it is said these things will be reported; for we are
sharers in all the benefits which God, in the days of old, bestowed upon his
ancient people. The outward splendor for which Jerusalem was admired does not,
indeed, stand forth conspicuous amongst us at the present day; but since the
coming of Christ into our world, the Church has been no less richly and
magnificently adorned with spiritual gifts than Jerusalem, under the shadows of
the Law, was in old time surrounded and fortified with strong walls and towers.
I have translated the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wgsp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>pasgu, exalt, </i>referring it to the value which ought to be put upon the
towers of the city because of their excellence. To explain it, as is done by
some, <i>fortify </i>or <i>strengthen, </i>seems to be less suitable. If any are
inclined rather to follow the interpretation of those who render it <i>look upon
</i>or <i>behold, </i>I have no great objection to
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For this God is our God for
ever and ever</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>From these words it
appears still more clearly, that when the prophet spake of the palaces of
Jerusalem, it was not that the godly should keep their eyes fixed upon them, but
that by the aid of these outward things they should elevate their minds to the
contemplation of the glory of God. God would have them to behold, as it were,
the marks of his grace engraven wherever they turned themselves, or rather, to
recognize him as present in these marks. From this we conclude, that whatever
dignity or excellence shines forth in the Church, we are not to consider it
otherwise than as the means of presenting God to our view, that we may magnify
and praise him in his gifts. The demonstrative pronoun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hz</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>zeh,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>is not superfluous; it is put to distinguish the only true God, of whose
existence and character the faithful were fully persuaded, from all the false
gods which men have set themselves to invent. The unbelieving may boldly speak
of the name of God, and prate about religion; but however much they may do this,
when they are more closely questioned, it will be found that they have nothing
certain or settled on the subject. Yea, the vain imaginations and inventions of
those who are not grounded in the true faith must necessarily come to nothing.
It is, then, the property of faith to set before us not a confused but a
distinct knowledge of God, and such as may not leave us wavering, as
superstition leaves its votaries, which, we know, is always introducing some new
counterfeit deities and in countless numbers. We ought, therefore, so much the
more to mark the emphatic demonstrative pronoun <i>this, </i>which is here used.
We meet with an almost similar passage in the prophecies of
Isaiah,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Lo, this is our God; we
have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for
him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation:"&#8212;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;232509&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
25:9</font><br><font face="Palatino"> as if the faithful had protested and
declared, We have not an uncertain God, or a God of whom we have only a confused
and an indistinct apprehension, but one of whom we have a true and solid
knowledge. When the faithful here declare that God will continue unchangeably
steadfast to his purpose in maintaining his Church, their object is to encourage
and strengthen themselves to persevere in a continued course of faith. What
follows immediately after, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He
will be our guide even unto death</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>seems
to be added by way of exposition. In making this statement, the people of God
assure themselves that he will be their guide and keeper for ever. They are not
to be understood as meaning that they will be safe under the government and
conduct of God in this life only, and that he will abandon them in the midst of
death; but they express generally, and according to the common people's way of
speaking,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb204</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> what I have stated, that God will take
care of all who rely upon him even to the end. What we translate,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Even unto

Hebrew text, </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twm

same whether we read the one way or the other. Others translate it
<i>childhood,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb206</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>in this sense, As God has from
the beginning carefully preserved and maintained his Church, even as a father
brings up his children from their infancy, so he will continue to act in the
same manner. The first sense, however, in my opinion, is the more appropriate.
Others translate it <i>in secret </i>or
<i>hidden,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb207</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which seems equally remote from
the meaning of the prophet; unless, perhaps, we should understand him as
intending expressly to say, that God's way of exercising his government is
hidden, that we may not measure or judge of it by carnal reason, but by
faith.</font><br></div>

the despondency of the other, the Psalmist shows what little reason we have to
envy the supposed happiness of the ungodly, which, even when at its height, is

of this psalm, it discusses one of the most important principles in divine
philosophy, and there is a propriety in the elevated terms designed to awaken
and secure attention, with which the Psalmist announces his purpose to discourse
of things of a deep and momentous nature. To a superficial view, indeed, the
subject might seem trite and common-place, treating, as he does, of the
shortness of human life, and the vanity of those objects in which worldly men
confide. But the real scope of the psalm is, to comfort the people of God under
the sufferings to which they are exposed, by teaching them to expect a happy
change in their condition, when God, in his own time, shall interpose to rectify
the disorders of the present system. There is a higher lesson still inculcated
by the Psalmist &#8212; that, as God's providence of the world is not presently
apparent, we must exercise patience, and rise superior to the suggestions of
carnal sense in anticipating the favorable issue. That it is our duty to
maintain a resolute struggle with our afflictions, however severe these may be,
and that it were foolish to place happiness in the enjoyment of such fleeting
possessions as the riches, honors, or pleasures of this world, may be precepts
which even the heathen philosophers have enforced, but they have uniformly
failed in setting before us the true source of consolation. However admirably
they discourse of a happy life, they confine themselves entirely to
commendations upon virtue, and do not bring prominently forward to our view that
God, who governs the world, and to whom alone we can repair with confidence in
the most desperate circumstances. But slender comfort can be derived upon this
subject from the teaching of philosophy. If, therefore, the Holy Ghost in this
psalm introduces to our notice truths which are sufficiently familiar to
experience, it is that he may raise our minds from them to the higher truth of
the divine government of the world, assuring us of the fact, that God sits
supreme, even when the wicked are triumphing most in their success, or when the
righteous are trampled under the foot of contumely, and that a day is coming
when he will dash the cup of pleasure out of the hands of his enemies, and
rejoice the hearts of his friends, by delivering them out of their severest
distresses. This is the only consideration which can impart solid comfort under
our afflictions. Formidable and terrible in themselves, they would overwhelm our
souls, did not the Lord lift upon us the light of his countenance. Were we not
assured that he watches over our safety, we could find no remedy from our evils,
and no quarter to which we might resort under
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The remarks which have been made may
explain the manner in which the inspired writer introduces the psalm, soliciting
our attention, as about to discourse on a theme unusually high and important.
Two things are implied in this verse, that the subject upon which he proposes to
enter is of universal application, and that we require to be admonished and
aroused ere we are brought to a due measure of consideration. The words which I
have translated, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>inhabitants of
the world</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>are translated by others,
<i>inhabitants of time; </i>but this is a harsh mode of expression, however much
it may agree with the scope of the psalm. He calls upon all men
indiscriminately, because all were equally concerned in the truths which he
intended to announce. By </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sons of
Adam</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>we may understand the meaner or
lower class of mankind; and by <i>sons of
men,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb213</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>the high, the noble, or such as
sustain any pre-eminence in life. Thus, in the outset, he states it to be his
purpose to instruct high and low without exception; his subject being one in
which the whole human family was interested, and in which every individual
belonging to it required to be
instructed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My mouth shall speak of
wisdom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The prophet was warranted in
applying these commendatory terms to the doctrine which he was about to
communicate. It is, no doubt, by plain appeals to observation that we find him
reproving human folly; but the general principle upon which his instruction
proceeds is one by no means obvious to the common sense of mankind, not to say
that his design in using such terms is less to assert the dignity of his subject
than simply to awaken attention. This he does all the more effectually by
speaking as one who would apply his own mind to instruction rather than assume
the office of exhortation. He puts himself forward as an humble scholar, one
who, in acting the part of teacher, has an eye at the same time to his own
improvement. It were desirable that all the ministers of God should be actuated
by a similar spirit, disposing them to regard God as at once their own teacher
and that of the common people, and to embrace in the first place themselves that
divine word which they preach to
others.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb214</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The Psalmist had another object in
view. He would secure the greater weight and deference to his doctrine by
announcing that he had no intention to vend fancies of his own, but to advance
what he had learned in the school of God. This is the true method of instruction
to be followed in the Church. The man who holds the office of teacher must apply
himself to the reception of truth before he attempt to communicate it, and in
this manner become the means of conveying to the hands of others that which God
has committed to his own. Wisdom is not the growth of human genius. It must be
sought from above, and it is impossible that any should speak with the propriety
and knowledge necessary for the edification of the Church, who has not, in the
first place, been taught at the feet of the Lord. To condescend upon the words,
some read in the third verse, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
the meditation of my heart shall speak of
understanding</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But as it were a harsh
and improper expression to say that <i>the meditation of the heart speaks, </i>I
have adopted the simpler reading.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.<i>

similitudes is given to any remarkable or important sayings. The Psalmist, when
he adds that he will <i>open </i>his dark saying, shows that nothing was farther
from his intention than to wrap the subject of his discourse in perplexing and
intricate obscurity. The truths of revelation are so high as to exceed our
comprehension; but, at the same time, the Holy Spirit has accommodated them so
far to our capacity, as to render all Scripture profitable for instruction. None
can plead ignorance: for the deepest and most difficult doctrines are made plain
to the most simple and unlettered of mankind. I see little force in the idea
suggested by several interpreters, of the Psalmist having employed his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>harp</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that he might render a subject in itself harsh and disagreeable more
engaging by the charms of music. He would merely follow the usual practice of
accompanying the psalm with the
harp.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

enters upon the point on which he proposed to discourse, That the people of God
must not yield to despondency even in the most distressing circumstances, when
their enemies may seem to have enclosed them on every side, but must rest
assured that God, although he connives for a time, is awake to their condition,
and only watches the best opportunity of executing his judgments. This manner of
introducing the subject by interrogation is much more emphatic than if he had
simply asserted his resolution to preserve his mind undisturbed in the midst of
adversity. In the second clause of the verse he particularises the heaviest and
most bitter of all afflictions, those which are experienced by the righteous
when their enemies triumph in the unrestrained indulgence of their wickedness.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>the adverb of time, must therefore be understood<i> &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When the iniquity of my heel
shall compass me about</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There is a
different meaning which some interpreters have attached to the words, namely, If
I should fear in the days of evil, and be guilty of the excessive anxieties of
the unbeliever, &#8212; in that case, when the hour of my death came, my
iniquity would compass me about.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The

But this interpretation is to be dismissed at once as most unnatural. Nor do I
see what reason others have for referring this word to <i>the thoughts, </i>for
I believe that in no other part of Scripture can such a metaphor or similitude
be found. Others, with more plausibility, have rendered the original word
<i>liers in wait,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb218</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>because the Hebrew verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bq[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>akab, </i>signifies <i>to deceive; </i>and they consider the Psalmist as
intimating, that he would not fear though crafty and treacherous men laid snares
for him. In my opinion, there is no figure intended; and he means to say, that
he would have no fear when his enemies surrounded him, and in pursuing him,
trode, as it were, upon his heel. The French have a similar expression,
"Poursuyvre jusques aux talons."</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb219</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I agree with them, that he speaks of
enemies, but it is of their wicked persecution as they press upon him in the
height of their power, and with design to destroy him, keep themselves near him,
and tread, so to speak, upon his very
heel.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They trust in their
wealth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We are now furnished with the
reason why the suffering children of God should dismiss their apprehensions, and
keep themselves from despondency, even when reduced to extremity by the violence
and treachery of their enemies. Any boasted power which they possess is fleeting
and evanescent. The Psalmist would convince us that the fear of man is
unwarrantable; that it argues ignorance of what man is even at his best; and
that it were as reasonable to startle at a shadow or a spectre.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They boast
themselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the multitude of their
riches</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and this is an error into which
we are disposed to fall, forgetting that the condition of man in this world is
fluctuating and transitory. It is not merely from the intrinsic insufficiency of
wealth, honors, or pleasures, to confer true happiness, that the Psalmist proves
the misery of worldly men, but from their manifest and total incapacity of
forming a correct judgment of such possessions. Happiness is connected with the
state of mind of that man who enjoys it, and none would call those happy who are
sunk in stupidity and security, and are destitute of understanding. The Psalmist
satisfactorily proves the infatuation of the wicked from the confidence which
they place in their power and wealth, and their disposition to boast of them. It
is a convincing sign of folly when one cannot discern what is before his eyes.
Not a day passes without forcing the plain fact upon their notice, that none can
redeem the life of another; so that their conduct is nothing less than insanity.
Some read, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A man shall not be
able to redeem his brother</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>which
amounts to the same meaning, and the text admits of this translation. The Hebrew
word

<i>ach, </i>which I have rendered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>brother</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>is by others translated <i>one; </i>but I do not approve, although I would
not absolutely reject, this reading. The Psalmist adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>none can give a price to God for
the ransom of another</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>where he adverts
to the truth that men's lives are absolutely at the disposal of God, and that
they never can be extended by any human arrangement one moment beyond the period
which God has fixed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He enforces the same lesson
in the verse which follows, where he states that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the redemption of their soul is
precious</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>an expression not to be
understood as implying merely that it is an event of rare occurrence, but that
it never can take place, as
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;090301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 3:1, where the word of the Lord is said to have been precious under the
priesthood of Eli, when it is evidently meant that it had ceased altogether. The
Psalmist would assert that no man can hope to purchase an immortality either for
himself or others in this world. I have rendered the close of verse 8,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And their continuance for
ever</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but others, who construe the
Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ldj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chadal, </i>as a verb, meaning <i>to cease, </i>read, <i>And ceaseth for
ever, </i>as if the Psalmist meant that no price was sufficiently great to
answer the purpose, and that it must therefore cease for ever, as what could
never obtain the end desired. I consider that which I have given to be the real
meaning of the word, having had occasion already to observe upon Psalm 39:5,
that it signifies the fixed term of human life. The words in verse 9,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That he should still live for
ever</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>more fully express the truth, that
it is not merely impossible to redeem the life of men when they are dead, but
impossible while they are yet living, to extend the term of their existence. A
definite limit has been assigned to every man's life. This he cannot pass over,
and the Psalmist would impress the fact upon us as one which stamps folly upon
the conduct of the wicked, who will cherish their unfounded confidence even at
the moment when they are upon the brink of the grave. In all this, it may strike
the reader that he has not announced any thing which merits being called a
<i>dark saying, </i>and has rather been treating a popular subject in a very
plain style of language; but if he consider that David here condemns, as by a
voice issuing from the awful judgment-seat of God, the stupidity of such as
forget that they are men, he will not be disposed to reckon the expression
inapplicable. Again, we have seen that he <i>has opened </i>his dark saying, it
being the divine will that instruction should be delivered in a form adapted to
the meanest capacity.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

verses to be connected, and that it is the intention of the Psalmist to censure
the folly of those who dream of spending an eternity in this world, and set
themselves seriously to establish a permanent settlement in it, though they
cannot but see their fellow-creatures cut down daily before their eyes by the
stroke of death. It is a common proverb, that experience teaches fools, and they
may be looked upon as something worse who will not lay to heart their mortality,
when surrounded by so many convincing illustrations of it. This seems obviously
to be the connection. These infatuated enemies of God, as if he had said, cannot
fail to perceive that death is the universal lot of mankind, that the wise are
equally liable to it with the foolish; and yet they persist in the imagination
that they will remain here always, and will live as if they were never to quit
with this world! They see what happens to others, that all, without exception or
discrimination, are involved in the common mortality; and they must observe how
often it happens that wealth passes

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yrja</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>acherim, </i>I translate <i>strangers, </i>rather than <i>others; </i>for
although it may be extended to successors of any kind, yet I think that the
Psalmist here supposes the case of wealth passing into the hands of those who
are not our natural and lawful heirs, and cannot be considered in any sense as
representing us. Many not only die, but die childless, and their name becomes
extinct, which is an additional ingredient of bitterness in the cup of the
worldling. And yet all these affecting lessons of experience are entirely lost
upon them, and they still in their secret thoughts fondly cherish the idea of
living here for ever. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">brq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kereb, </i>means <i>the middle </i>of anything; but it is taken
metaphorically to signify <i>the heart, </i>or inward parts of the man. Here it
denotes that their <i>secret thoughts </i>are occupied with an imaginary
eternity which they hope to enjoy upon earth. Another and more ingenious
interpretation has been suggested by some, that as the word occasionally means a
<i>tomb, </i>the Psalmist may here be satirising those who think to perpetuate
their memory after death by rearing expensive
mausoleums.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb221</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This view of the words is strained and
unnatural; and what immediately follows proves that the other is the most
correct, when it is added, that worldly men
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>call out their names upon the

their power to win reputation amongst their fellow-creatures. Their desire
should be to have their names written in the book of life, and to be blessed
before God and his holy angels; but their ambition is of another kind &#8212; to
be renowned and extolled upon earth. By the expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>calling
out</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it is insinuated that the fame of
ungodly men is but an empty sound. Some interpreters prefer reading,

fb222</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that they might leave some
monument of themselves to posterity. But what the Psalmist seems chiefly to
insist upon is, that they are wholly bent upon earthly
renown.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12<i>.

delusory nature of the fancies entertained by the ungodly, he next shows that
however fondly they may cherish them, they must experience the same fate with
the beasts of the field. It is true that there is a great difference, so far as
the soul is concerned, between man and the brute creation; but the Psalmist
speaks of things as they appear in this world, and in this respect he was
warranted to say of the ungodly that they die as the beasts. His subject does
not lead him to speak of the world to come. He is reasoning with the children of
this world, who have no respect to another, and no idea of a farther happiness
than that which they enjoy here. He accordingly ridicules their folly in
conceiving of themselves as privileged with exemption from the ordinary lot of
humanity, and warns them that death will soon be near to humble their
presumptuous thoughts, and put them on a level with the meanest of the lower
creatures. This I prefer to the more ingenious interpretation which some would
put upon the words, that they reduced themselves to the level of beasts by not
recognising the true dignity of their nature, which consists in the possession
of a never-dying soul. The Psalmist's great aim is to show the vanity of the
boasting of the wicked, from the nearness of death, which must join them in one
common fate with the beasts of the field. The last word in the verse gives the
reason why the ungodly may be compared to the beasts &#8212;

variously rendered, I shall briefly, before giving my own sense of it, state the
views which have been taken by others. As the Hebrew word

kesel, </i>which I have translated<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>foolishness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

consider it to be here taken for <i>fat; </i>as if this imagination of theirs
were, so to speak, fat which stupified and rendered their senses obtuse. But
this reading is too forced to bear examination. Others read,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This their way is their
folly</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb227</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, the reason why they
pursue such a line of conduct is, that they are destitute of sound judgment;
for, were they not utterly devoid of it, and did they possess one spark of
intelligence, would they not reflect upon the end for which they were created,
and direct their minds to higher objects? I rather conceive the Psalmist simply
to mean, that the event proves them to be wholly destitute of wisdom, in placing
their happiness upon earthly objects, and brands them, notwithstanding all the
pretensions they make to foresight and shrewdness, with ridicule and contempt.
And this he states, to show in a more aggravated light the madness of their
posterity, who will not be instructed by the fate of their predecessors. The
last clause of the verse has also been variously rendered, and I may state the
views which have been taken of it by others. The Hebrew verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hxr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ratsah, </i>which I have translated <i>to acquiesce, </i>they render, <i>to
walk, </i>and the noun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>phi, </i>translated <i>mouth </i>or <i>sayings, </i>they take to mean <i>a
measure, </i>thus understanding the Psalmist to say, that the children walked by
the same rule with their fathers; and they change the letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>beth, </i>into
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">k</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
caph, </i>the mark of similitude which is sufficiently common in the Hebrew
language. This view of the passage comes near to the proper meaning of it. Some
conceive that there is an allusion to the beasts of the field; but this is
improbable. It seems best to understand with others that the word mouth denotes
<i>principles </i>or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sayings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>and the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hxr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ratsah, </i>may be taken in its more ordinary and most generally received
sense, which implies consent or complacency. I have therefore translated it
<i>to acquiesce. </i>The boasted confidence of the ungodly proving vain in the
issue, and exposing them justly to ridicule, it argues a monstrous infatuation
in their posterity, with this example before their eyes, to set their affections
upon the same trifles, and to feel and express themselves exactly in the same
manner as those who went before them. If men reflect at all upon the judgments
which God executes in the world, we might expect that they would particularly
consider his dealings with their immediate predecessors, and when, wholly
insensible to the lessons which should be learned from their fate, they
precipitate themselves into the same courses, this convincingly demonstrates
their brutish folly.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14<i>.</i>
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Like sheep they are laid in
the grave; death shall feed
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb228</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The figure is striking. They go
down into the grave as sheep are gathered into the fold by the shepherd. The
entire world might not seem vast enough for men of a haughty spirit. They are so
swollen with their vain imaginations, that they would engross universal nature
to themselves. But the Psalmist, finding the wicked spread as it were far and
wide, in the boundless pride of their hearts, collects them together into the
grave, and hands them over to death as their shepherd. He intimates, that
whatever superiority they might affect over their fellow-creatures, they would
feel, when too late, that their boasting was vain, and be forced to yield
themselves up to the irresistible and humiliating stroke of death. In the second
part of the verse, the Psalmist points out the very different fate which awaits
the children of God, and thus anticipates an obvious objection. It might be
said, "Thou<i> </i>tellest us that those who place their confidence in this
world must die. But this is no new doctrine. And why convert into matter of
reproach what must be considered as a law of nature, attaching to all mankind?
Who gave thee a privilege to insult the children of mortality? Art thou not one
of them thyself?" This objection he meets effectually, by granting that on the
supposition of death being the destruction of the whole man, he would have
advanced no new or important doctrine, but arguing that infidel worldlings
reject a better life to come, and thus lay themselves justly open to this
species of reprehension. For surely it is the height of folly in any man for a
mere momentary happiness &#8212; a very dream &#8212; to abdicate the crown of
heaven, and renounce his hopes for eternity. Here it must be apparent, as I
already took occasion to observe, that the doctrine of this psalm is very
different from that taught by the philosophers. I grant that they may have
ridiculed worldly ambition with elegance and eloquence, exposed the other vices,
and insisted upon the topics of our frailty and mortality; but they uniformly
omitted to state the most important truth of all, that God governs the world by
his providence, and that we may expect a happy issue out of our calamities, by
coming to that everlasting inheritance which awaits us in heaven. It may be
asked, what that dominion is which the upright shall eventually obtain? I would
reply, that as the wicked must all be prostrated before the Lord Jesus Christ,
and made his footstool, His members will share in the victory of their Head. It
is indeed said, that he "will deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father,"
but he will not do this that he may put an end to his Church, but "that God may
be all in all,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461524&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 15:24.) It is stated that this will be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the
morning</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb229</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; a beautiful and striking
metaphor. Surrounded as we are by darkness, our life is here compared to the
night, or to a sleep, an image which is specially applicable to the ungodly, who
lie as it were in a deep slumber, but not inapplicable to the people of God,
such being the dark mist which rests upon all things in this world, that even
their minds (except in so far as they are illuminated from above) are partially
enveloped in it. Here "we see only as through a glass darkly," and the coining
of the Lord will resemble the morning, when both the elect and reprobate will
awake. The former will then cast aside their lethargy and sloth, and being freed
from the darkness which rested upon them, will behold Christ the Sun of
Righteousness face to face, and the full effulgence of life which resides in
him. The others, who lie at present in a state of total darkness, will be
aroused from their stupidity, and begin to discover a new life, of which they
had previously no apprehension. We need to be reminded of this event, not only
because corruption presses us downwards and obscures our faith, but because
there are men who profanely argue against another life, from the continued
course of things in the world, scoffing, as Peter foretold,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600304&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Peter 3:4,) at the promise of a resurrection, and pointing, in derision, to the
unvarying regularity of nature throughout the lapse of ages. We may arm
ourselves against their arguments by what the Psalmist here declares, that, sunk
as the world is in darkness, there will dawn ere long a new morning, which will
introduce us to a better and an eternal existence. It follows, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their
strength</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or <i>their
form,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>strength</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>the words intimate, that though at present they are in possession of wealth
and power, they shall speedily decline and fall; but I see no objection to the
other meaning, which has more commonly been adopted. Paul tells us,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460731&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 7:31,) that "<i>the fashion </i>of this world passes away," a term
expressive of the evanescent nature of our earthly condition; and the Psalmist
may be considered as comparing their vain and unsubstantial glory to a shadow.
The words at the close of the verse are obscure. Some read,

better both with the words and scope of the psalm, that

dwelling</i></font><font face="Palatino">, which is put for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their

common in the Hebrew language. They reside at present in splendid mansions,
where they rest in apparent security, but we are reminded that they must soon
come out of them, and be received into the tomb. There may be a covert allusion
to their goings abroad to places of public resort with gaiety and pomp. These,
the Psalmist intimates, must give place to the sad procession by which they must
be carried down to the grave.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15<i>.

shall have dominion in the morning, and now he applies it to himself for the
confirmation of his own faith. This verse may, therefore, be regarded as a kind
of appendix to the former; in it he makes a personal application of what had
been said of all the righteous. By the word,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is to be understood <i>the
dominion </i>and <i>power, </i>and not <i>the stroke, </i>of the grave, as some
have rendered it. The prophet does not deny his liability to death; but he looks
to God as He who would defend and redeem him from it. We have here a convincing
proof of that faith in which the saints under the Law lived and died. It is
evident that their views were directed to another and a higher life, to which
the present was only preparatory. Had the prophet merely intended to intimate
that he expected deliverance from some ordinary emergency, this would have been
no more than what is frequently done by the children of the world, whom God
often delivers from great dangers. But here it is evident that he hoped for a
life beyond the grave, that he extended his glance beyond this sublunary sphere,
and anticipated the morning which will introduce eternity. From this we may
conclude, that the promises of the Law were spiritual, and that our fathers who
embraced them were willing to confess themselves pilgrims upon earth, and sought
an inheritance in heaven. It evinced gross stupidity in the Sadducees, educated
as they were under the Law, to conceive of the soul as mortal. The man must be
blind indeed who can find no mention of a future life in this passage. To what
other interpretation can we wrest the preceding verse, when it speaks of a
morning altogether new and peculiar? We are sufficiently accustomed to see the
return of morning, but it points us to a day of an extraordinary kind, when God
himself shall rise upon us as the sun, and surprise us with the discovery of his
glory. When the Psalmist adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Assuredly God
will</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>redeem my
soul</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb231</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the power of the
grave</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>does he not contemplate a special
privilege, such as could not be shared by all other men? If deliverance from
death, then, be a privilege peculiar to the children of God, it is evident that
they are expectants of a better life. We must not overlook, (what I have already
noticed,) that the sure method of profiting by the divine promises is, to apply
to ourselves what God has offered generally to all without exception. This is
done by the prophet, for how could he have arrived at an assured promise of the
redemption of his soul, except by the general fact known to him of the future
glory awaiting the children of God, and by concluding himself to be amongst
their number? The last clause of the verse runs in the Hebrew literally,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for he will take me
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some, however, resolve the causal
particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ki, </i>which we render<i> for, </i>into the adverb of time <i>when, </i>and
the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jql</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lakach, </i>which we translate <i>to receive </i>or <i>to take up, </i>they
translate <i>to cut off, </i>or <i>take away from this world, </i>giving to the
passage this sense, When God shall have called my soul out of this world to
himself, he will rescue it from the power of the grave. I am afraid that this is
rather too strained an interpretation. Those seem to take a juster view of the
words who consider that the future tense has been substituted for the perfect,
and who retain the proper signification of the causal particle, reading,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for he has taken me
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The prophet did not consider that
the ground of his hope for a better resurrection was to be found in himself, but
in the gratuitous adoption of God who had taken him into his favor. There is no
need, however, why we should suppose a change of tense, and not understand the
Psalmist as meaning that God would redeem his soul from death, by undertaking
the guardianship of it when he came to die. The despairing fears which so many
entertain when descending to the grave spring from the fact of their not
commending their spirit to the preserving care of God. They do not consider it
in the light of a precious deposit which will be safe in his protecting hands.
Let our faith be established in the great truth, that our soul, though it
appears to evanish upon its separation from the body, is in reality only
gathered to the bosom of God, there to be kept until the day of the
resurrection.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

form of an exhortation, the same sentiment which he had formerly expressed, that
the children of God have no reason to dread the wealth and power of their
enemies, or to envy their evanescent prosperity; and as the best preservative
against despondency, he would have them to direct their eyes habitually to the
end of life. The effect of such a contemplation will be at once to check any
impatience we might be apt to feel under our short-lived miseries, and to raise
our minds in holy contempt above the boasted but delusory grandeur of the
wicked. That this may not impose upon our minds, the prophet recalls us to the
consideration of the subject of death &#8212; that event which is immediately at
hand, and which no sooner arrives than it strips them of their false glory, and
consigns them to the tomb. So much is implied in the words,

apostrophised;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

unlicensed passions.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19<i>.</i>

false are the flatteries by which the wicked deceive themselves, and are
deceived by others. Be they ever so intoxicated with the praises of the world,
or with their own vain imaginations, yet they cannot live beyond the age of
their fathers; and, granting their life to be extended to the longest term, it
can never stretch into eternity. Others understand the expression as synonymous
with </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their being gathered to the
tomb along with their fathers </i></font><font face="Palatino">who have gone
before them; as in Scripture death is usually called "The way of all the earth."
The Psalmist, a little above, had spoken of their being gathered together in the
grave as sheep in a fold. According to this view, the meaning of the passage is,
that having never aspired after heaven, but having been sunk in the low
grovelling pursuits of this world, they would come at last to the same fate with
their fathers. When it is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall not see the light even

consignment to everlasting darkness.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb236</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In my opinion, both clauses of the
verse combine to express the same truth, That however they may flatter and
deceive themselves, they cannot prolong their life beyond the common term of
mortality. As either interpretation, however, agrees with the general scope of
the psalm, the reader may choose for himself. Should the latter be adopted, the
words in the close of the verse are to be considered as asserting that the
ungodly can only enjoy the light of life for a short period, as they have no
hope of another existence beyond the grave. We are taught by the Psalmist, in
the words which have been under our consideration, to beware of flattering
ourselves in the possessions of this world, and to be principally anxious for
the attainment of that happiness which is reserved for us in heaven. We are also
warned not to allow ourselves to be carried away by the erring influence of
worldly applause. Even heathen authors have taught us the same lesson. Thus the
poet Persius says, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Non si quid turbida Roma
</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Elevet, accedas, examenve improbum

art."</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb237</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But the disposition to be deceived by
flattery is one so strongly marked in our nature, as to require that we should
attend to the weightier admonition of one who was

he reprehends have reduced themselves to the level of the beasts that perish, by
senselessly devouring the blessings which God has bestowed, and thus divesting
themselves of that honor which God had put upon them. It is against the abuse of
this world that the prophet has been directing his censures. They are aimed at
those who riot in the bounties of God without any recognition of God himself,
and who devote themselves in an infatuated manner to the passing glory of this
world, instead of rising from it to the contemplation of the things which are
above.</font><br></div>

50</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There have always been hypocrites in the Church, men
who have placed religion in a mere observance of outward ceremonies, and among
the Jews there were many who turned their attention entirely to the figures of
the Law, without regarding the truth which was represented under them. They
conceived that nothing more was demanded of them but their sacrifices and other
rites. The following psalm is occupied with the reprehension of this gross
error, and the prophet exposes in severe terms the dishonor which is cast upon
the name of God by confounding ceremony with religion, showing that the worship
of God is spiritual, and consists of two parts, prayer and
thanksgiving.</font><br></div>

to our reprobation, as proving themselves unworthy of the honor which has been
placed upon them, and debasing themselves by a degenerate use of this world.
From this let us learn, that if we are miserable here, it must be by our own
fault; for could we discern and properly improve the many mercies which God has
bestowed upon us, we would not want, even on earth, a foretaste of eternal
blessedness. Of this, however we fall short through our corruption. The wicked,
even while on earth, have a pre-eminency over the beasts of the field in reason
and intelligence, which form a part of the image of God; but in reference to the
end which awaits them the prophet puts both upon a level, and declares, that
being divested of all their vain-glory, they will eventually perish like the
beasts. Their souls will indeed survive, but it is not the less true that death
will consign them to everlasting
disgrace.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

bears the name of Asaph; but whether he was the author of it, or merely received
it as chief singer from the hand of David, cannot be known. This, however, is a
matter of little consequence. The opinion has been very generally entertained,
that the psalm points to the period of the Church's renovation, and that the
design of the prophet is to apprise the Jews of the coming abrogation of their
figurative worship under the Law. That the Jews were subjected to the rudiments
of the world, which continued till the Church's majority, and the arrival of
what the apostle calls "the fullness of times,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
4:4,) admits of no doubt; the only question is, whether the prophet must here be
considered as addressing the men of his own age, and simply condemning the abuse
and corruption of the legal worship, or as predicting the future kingdom of
Christ? From the scope of the psalm, it is sufficiently apparent that the
prophet does in fact interpret the Law to his contemporaries, with a view of
showing them that the ceremonies, while they existed, were of no importance
whatever by themselves, or otherwise than connected with a higher meaning. Is it
objected, that God never called the whole world except upon the promulgation of
the Gospel, and that the doctrine of the Law was addressed only to one peculiar
people? the answer is obvious, that the prophet in this place describes the
whole world as convened not for the purpose of receiving one common system of
faith, but of hearing God plead his cause with the Jews in its presence. The
appeal is of a parallel nature with others which we find in
Scripture:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Give ear, O ye heavens!

<div><font face="Palatino">or as in another place,</font><br></div>

1:2.)</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon"> fb243</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This vehement mode of address was required in
speaking to hypocrites, that they might be roused from their complacent
security, and their serious attention engaged to the message of God. The Jews
had special need to be awakened upon the point to which reference is here made.
Men are naturally disposed to outward show in religion, and, measuring God by
themselves, imagine that an attention to ceremonies constitutes the sum of their
duty. There was a strong disposition among the Jews to rest in an observance of
the figures of the Law, and it is well known with what severity the prophets all
along reprehended this superstition, by which the worst and most abandoned
characters were led to arrogate a claim to piety, and hide their abominations
under the specious garb of godliness. The prophet, therefore, required to do
more than simply expose the defective nature of that worship which withdraws the
attention of men from faith and holiness of heart to outward ceremonies; it was
necessary that, in order to check false confidence and banish insensibility, he
should adopt the style of severe reproof. God is here represented as citing all
the nations of the earth to his tribunal, not with the view of prescribing the
rule of piety to an assembled world, or collecting a church for his service, but
with the design of alarming the hypocrite, and terrifying him out of his
self-complacency. It would serve as a spur to conviction, thus to be made aware
that the whole world was summoned as a witness to their dissimulation, and that
they would be stripped of that pretended piety of which they were disposed to
boast. It is with a similar object that he addresses Jehovah as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the God of
gods</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>to possess their minds with a
salutary terror, and dissuade them from their vain attempts to elude his
knowledge. That this is his design will be made still more apparent from the
remaining context, where we are presented with a formidable description of the
majesty of God, intended to convince the hypocrite of the vanity of those
childish trifles with which he would evade the scrutiny of so great and so
strict a judge.</font><br><font face="Palatino">To obviate an objection which
might be raised against his doctrine in this psalm, that it was subversive of
the worship prescribed by Moses, the prophet intimates that this judgment which
he announced would be in harmony with the Law. When God speaks
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>out of
Zion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he necessarily sanctions the
authority of the Law; and the Prophets, when at any time they make use of this
form of speech, declare themselves to be interpreters of the Law. That holy
mountain was not chosen of man's caprice, and therefore stands identified with
the Law. The prophet thus cuts off any pretext which the Jews might allege to
evade his doctrine, by announcing that such as concealed their wickedness, under
the specious covert of ceremonies, would not be condemned of God by any new code
of religion, but by that which was ministered originally by Moses. He gives Zion
the honorable name of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
perfection of beauty</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because God had
chosen it for his sanctuary, the place where his name should be invoked, and
where his glory should be manifested in the doctrine of the
Law.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Our God shall come, and
shall not keep
silence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb244</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He repeats that God would come,
in order to confirm his doctrine, and more effectually arouse them. He would
come, and should not always keep silence, lest they should be encouraged to
presume upon his forbearance. Two reasons may be assigned why the prophet calls
God </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>our
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He may be considered as setting
himself, and the comparatively small number of the true fearers of the Lord, in
opposition to the hypocrites whom he abhors, claiming God to be his God, and not
theirs, as they were disposed to boast; or rather, he speaks as one of the
people, and declares that the God who was coming to avenge the corruptions of
his worship was the same God whom all the children of Abraham professed to
serve. He who shall come, as if he had said, is our God, the same in whom we
glory, who established his covenant with Abraham, and gave us his Law by the
hand of Moses. He adds, that God would come with
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fire</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tempest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>in order to awaken a salutary fear in the secure hearts of the Jews, that
they might learn to tremble at the judgments of God, which they had hitherto
regarded with indifference and despised, and in allusion to the awful
manifestation which God made of himself from Sinai,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021916&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
19:16; see also
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
12:18.) The air upon that occasion resounded with thunders and the noise of
trumpets, the heavens were illuminated with lightnings, and the mountain was in
flames, it being the design of God to procure a reverential submission to the
Law which he announced. And it is here intimated, that God would make a
similarly terrific display of his power, in coming to avenge the gross abuses of
his holy religion.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He shall call to the
heavens from above</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is plain from
this verse for what purpose God, as he had already announced, would call upon
the earth. This was to witness the settlement of his controversy with his own
people the Jews, against whom judgment was to be pronounced, not in the ordinary
manner as by his prophets, but with great solemnity before the whole world. The
prophet warns the hypocritical that they must prepare to be driven from their
hiding-place, that their cause would be decided in the presence of men and
angels, and that they would he dragged without excuse before that dreadful
assembly. It may be asked, why the prophet represents the true fearers of the
Lord as cited to his bar, when it is evident that the remonstrance which follows
in the psalm is addressed to the hypocritical and degenerate portion of the
Jews? To this I answer, that God here speaks of the whole Church, for though a
great part of the race of Abraham had declined from the piety of their
ancestors, yet he has a respect to the Jewish Church, as being his own
institution. He speaks of them as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his meek
ones</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>to remind them of what they ought
to be in consistency with their calling, and not as if they were all without
exception patterns of godliness. The form of the address conveys a rebuke to
those amongst them whose real character was far from corresponding with their
profession. Others have suggested a more refined interpretation, as if the
meaning were, Separate the small number of my sincere worshippers from the
promiscuous multitude by whom my name is profaned, lest they too should
afterwards be seduced to a vain religion of outward form. I do not deny that
this agrees with the scope of the prophet. But I see no reason why a church,
however universally corrupted, provided it contain a few godly members, should
not be denominated, in honor of this remnant, the holy people of God.
Interpreters have differed upon the last clause of the verse:

fb245</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Others think that the spiritual and
true worship of God is here directly opposed to sacrifices; as if it had been
said, Those who, instead of sacrifices, keep my covenant in the right and
appointed manner, by yielding to me the sincere homage of their heart. But in my
opinion, the prophet is here to be viewed as pointing out with commendation the
true and genuine use of the legal worship; for it was of the utmost consequence
that it should be known what was the real end for which God appointed sacrifices
under the Law. The prophet here declares that sacrifices were of no value
whatever except as seals of God's covenant, an interpretative handwriting of
submission to it, or in general as means employed for ratifying it. There is an
allusion to the custom then universally prevalent of interposing sacrifices,
that covenants might be made more solemn, and be more religiously
observed.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb246</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In like manner, the design with which
sacrifices were instituted by God was to bind his people more closely to
himself, and to ratify and confirm his covenant. The passage is well worthy of
our particular notice, as defining those who are to be considered the true
members of the Church. They are such, on the one hand, as are characterised by
the spirit of meekness, practising righteousness in their intercourse with the
world; and such, on the other, as close in the exercise of a genuine faith with
the covenant of adoption which God has proposed to them. This forms the true
worship of God, as he has himself delivered it to us from heaven; and those who
decline from it, whatever pretensions they may make to be considered a church of
God, are excommunicated from it by the Holy Spirit. As to sacrifices or other
ceremonies, they are of no value, except in so far as they seal to us the pure
truth of God. All such rites, consequently, as have no foundation in the word of
God, are unauthorised, and that worship which has not a distinct reference to
the word is but a corruption of things
sacred.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

vain enough to imagine that their idle and fantastic service was the perfection
of righteousness; but they are here warned by the prophet, that God, who had
seemed to connive at their folly, was about to reveal his own righteousness from
heaven, and expose their miserable devices. "Think you," as if he had said,
"that God can take delight in the mockery of your deluded services? Though you
send up the smoke of them to heaven, God will make known his righteousness in
due time from above, and vindicate it from the dishonors done to it by your
wicked inventions. The heavens themselves will attest your perfidy in despising
true holiness, and corrupting the pure worship of God. He will no longer suffer
your gratuitous aspersions of his character, as if he took no notice of the
enmity which lurks under your pretended friendship." There is thus a cogency in
the prophet's manner of treating his subject. Men are disposed to admit that God
is judge, but, at the same time, to fabricate excuses for evading his judgment,
and it was therefore necessary that the sentence which God was about to
pronounce should be vindicated from the vain cavils which might be brought
against it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear, O my people! and I

spoken as the herald of God, throwing out several expressions designed to alarm
the minds of those whom he addressed. But from this to the end of the psalm God
himself is introduced as the speaker; and to show the importance of the subject,
he uses additional terms to awaken attention, calling them his own people, that
he might challenge the higher authority to his words, and intimating, that the
following address is not of a mere ordinary description, but an expostulation
with them for the infraction of his covenant. Some read, <i>I will testify
against thee. </i>But the reference, as we may gather from the common usage of
Scripture, seems rather to be to a discussion of mutual claims. God would remind
them of his covenant, and solemnly <i>exact </i>from them, as his chosen people,
what was due according to the terms of it. He announces himself to be the God of
Israel, that he may recall them to allegiance and subjection, and the repetition
of his name is emphatical: as if he had said, When you would have me to submit
to your inventions, how far is this audacity from that honor and reverence which
belong to me? I am God, and therefore my majesty ought to repress presumption,
and make all flesh keep silence when I speak; and among you, to whom I have made
myself known as your God, I have still stronger claims to
homage.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will not reprove thee
for thy sacrifices, etc</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>God now
proceeds to state the charge which he adduced against them. He declares, that he
attached no value whatsoever to sacrifices in themselves considered. Not that he
asserts this rite of the Jews to have been vain and useless, for in that case it
never would have been instituted by God; but there is this difference betwixt
religious exercises and others, that they can only meet the approbation of God
when performed in their true spirit and meaning. On any other supposition they
are deservedly rejected. Similar language we will find employed again and again
by the prophets, as I have remarked in other places, and particularly in
connection with the fortieth psalm. Mere outward ceremonies being therefore
possessed of no value, God repudiates the idea that he had ever insisted upon
them as the main thing in religion, or designed that they should be viewed in
any other light than as helps to spiritual worship. Thus in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240722&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
7:22, he denies that he had issued any commandment regarding sacrifices; and the
prophet Micah says,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Will the Lord
be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? and
what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy?"
&#8212;
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;330607&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Micah
6:7)</font><br><font face="Palatino">"I desire mercy," he says in another place,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;280606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
6:6,) "and not sacrifice." The same doctrine is every where declared by the
prophets. I might refer especially to the prophecies of Isaiah, chapter 1:12;
58:1, 2; 66:3. The sacrifices of the ungodly are not only represented as
worthless and rejected by the Lord, but as peculiarly calculated to provoke his
anger. Where a right use has been made of the institution, and they have been
observed merely as ceremonies for the confirmation and increase of faith, then
they are described as being essentially connected with true religion; but when
offered without faith, or, what is still worse, under the impression of their
meriting the favor of God for such as continue in their sins, they are
reprobated as a mere profanation of divine worship. It is evident, then, what
God means when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
not reprove thee for thy sacrifices</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>he
looked to something beyond these. The last clause of the verse may be understood
as asserting that their burnt-offerings were before the eyes of the Lord to the
producing even of satiety and disgust, as we find him saying,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:13,) that they were "an abomination unto him." There are some, however, who
consider the negative in the beginning of the verse as applying to both clauses,
and that God here declares that he did not design to reckon with them for any
want of regularity in the observance of their sacrifices. It has been well
suggested by some, that the relative may be understood,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy burnt-offerings which are
continually before me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as if he had
said, According to the Law these are imperative; but I will bring no accusation
against you at this time for omitting your
sacrifices.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

</i></b><i>I will take no calf out thy
house</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Two reasons are given in this and
the succeeding verses to prove that he cannot set any value upon sacrifices. The
first is, that supposing him to depend upon these, he needs not to be indebted
for them to man, having all the fullness of the earth at his command; and the
second, that he requires neither food nor drink as we do for the support of our
infirm natures. Upon the first of these he insists in the ninth and three
following verses, where he adverts to his own boundless possessions, that he may
show his absolute independence of human offerings. He then points at the wide
distinction betwixt himself and man, the latter being dependent for a frail
subsistence upon meat and drink, while he is the self-existent One, and
communicates life to all beside. There may be nothing new in the truths here
laid down by the Psalmist; but, considering the strong propensity we have by
nature to form our estimate of God from ourselves, and to degenerate into a
carnal worship, they convey a lesson by no means unnecessary, and which contains
profound wisdom, that man can never benefit God by any of his services, as we
have seen in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
16:2, "My goodness extendeth not unto thee." In the second place, God says that
he does not require any thing for his own us but that, as he is sufficient in
his own perfection, he has consulted the good of man in all that he has
enjoined. We have a passage in Isaiah to a similar
effect,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The heaven is my throne,
and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me, and
where is the place of my rest? For all these things hath mine hand made."

words</font><br><font face="Palatino">God asserts his absolute independence; for
while the world had a beginning, he himself was from eternity. From this it
follows, that as he subsisted when there was nothing without him which could
contribute to his fullness, he must have in himself a glorious
all-sufficiency.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

preceding context. Had it been stated in unqualified terms that sacrifices were
of no value, we might have been perplexed to know why in that case they were
instituted by God; but the difficulty disappears when we perceive that they are
spoken of only in comparison with the true worship of God. From this we infer,
that when properly observed, they were far from incurring divine condemnation.
There is in all men by nature a strong and ineffaceable conviction that they
ought to worship God. Indisposed to worship him in a pure and spiritual manner,
it becomes necessary that they should invent some specious appearance as a
substitute; and however clearly they may be persuaded of the vanity of such
conduct, they persist in it to the last, because they shrink from a total
renunciation of the service of God. Men have always, accordingly, been found
addicted to ceremonies until they have been brought to the knowledge of that
which constitutes true and acceptable religion.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Praise</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and <i>prayer </i>are here to be considered as representing the whole of the
worship of God, according to the figure synecdoche. The Psalmist specifies only
one part of divine worship, when he enjoins us to acknowledge God as the Author
of all our mercies, and to ascribe to him the praise which is justly due unto
his name: and adds, that we should betake ourselves to his goodness, cast all
our cares into his bosom, and seek by prayer that deliverance which he alone can
give, and thanks for which must afterwards be rendered to him. Faith,
self-denial, a holy life, and patient endurance of the cross, are all sacrifices
which please God. But as <i>prayer </i>is the offspring of faith, and uniformly
accompanied with patience and mortification of sin, while
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>praise</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>where it is genuine, indicates holiness of heart, we need not wonder that
these two points of worship should here be employed to represent the whole.
Praise and prayer are set in opposition to ceremonies and mere external
observances of religion, to teach us, that the worship of God is spiritual.
Praise is first mentioned, and this might seem an inversion of natural order.
But in reality it may be ranked first without any violation of propriety. An
ascription to God of the honor due unto his name lies at the foundation of all
prayer, and application to him as the fountain of goodness is the most
elementary exercise of faith. Testimonies of his goodness await us ere yet we
are born into the world, and we may therefore be said to owe the debt of
gratitude before we are called to the necessity of supplication. Could we
suppose men to come into the world in the full exercise of reason and judgment,
their first act of spiritual sacrifice should be that of thanksgiving. There is
no necessity, however, for exercising our ingenuity in defense of the order here
adopted by the Psalmist, it being quite sufficient to hold that he here, in a
general and popular manner, describes the spiritual worship of God as consisting
in praise, prayer, and thanksgiving. In the injunction here given, to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pay our
vows</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>there is an allusion to what was
in use under the ancient dispensation,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"What shall I render unto
the Lord for all his benefits towards me? I will take the cup of salvation, and
call upon the name of the Lord."
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B612&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
116:12, 13</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What the words inculcate upon the Lord's people is,
in short, gratitude, which they were then in the habit of testifying by solemn
sacrifices. But we shall now direct our attention more particularly to the
important point of the doctrine which is set before us in this passage. And the
first thing deserving our notice is, that the Jews, as well as ourselves, were
enjoined to yield a spiritual worship to God. Our Lord, when he taught that this
was the only acceptable species of worship, rested his proof upon the one
argument, that "God is a spirit,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430424&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
4:24.) He was no less a spirit, however, under the period of the legal
ceremonies than after they were abolished; and must, therefore, have demanded
then the same mode of worship which he now enjoins. It is true that he subjected
the Jews to the ceremonial yoke, but in this he had a respect to the age of the
Church; as afterwards, in the abrogation of it, he had an eye to our advantage.
In every essential respect the worship was the same. The distinction was one
entirely of outward form, God accommodating himself to their weaker and unripe
apprehensions by the rudiments of ceremony, while he has extended a simple form
of worship to us who have attained a maturer age since the coming of Christ. In
himself there is no alteration. The idea entertained by the Manicheans, that the
change of dispensation necessarily inferred a change in God himself, was as
absurd as it would be to arrive at a similar conclusion from the periodical
alterations of the seasons. These outward rites are, therefore, in themselves of
no importance, and acquire it only in so far as they are useful in confirming
our faith, so that we may call upon the name of the Lord with a pure heart. The
Psalmist, therefore, justly denounces the hypocrites who gloried in their
ostentatious services, and declares that they observed them in vain. It may
occur to some, that as sacrifices sustained a necessary place under the Law,
they could not be warrantably neglected by the Jewish worshipper; but by
attending to the scope of the Psalmist, we may easily discover that he does not
propose to abrogate them so far as they were helps to piety, but to correct that
erroneous view of them, which was fraught with the deepest injury to
religion.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the fifteenth verse we have first
an injunction to prayer, then a promise of its being answered, and afterwards a
call to thanksgiving. We are enjoined to pray
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the day of
trouble</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>but not with the understanding
that we are to pray only then, for prayer is a duty incumbent upon us every day,
and every moment of our lives. Be our situation ever so comfortable and exempt
from disquietude, we must never cease to engage in the exercise of supplication,
remembering that, if God should withdraw his favor for a moment, we would be
undone. In affliction, however our faith is more severely tried, and there is a
propriety in specifying it as the season of prayer; the prophet pointing us to
God as the only resort and means of safety in the day of our urgent necessity. A
promise is subjoined to animate us in the duty, disposed as we are to be
overwhelmed by a sense of the majesty of God, or of our own unworthiness.
Gratitude is next enjoined, in consideration of God's answer to our prayers.
Invocation of the name of God being represented in this passage as constituting
a principal part of divine worship, all who make pretensions to piety will feel
how necessary it is to preserve the pure and uncorrupted form of it. We are
forcibly taught the detestable nature of the error upon this point entertained
by the Papists, who transfer to angels and to men an honor which belongs
exclusively to God. They may pretend to view these in no other light than as
patrons, who pray for them to God. But it is evident that these patrons are
impiously substituted by them in the room of Christ, whose mediation they
reject. It is apparent, besides, from the form of their prayers, that they
recognize no distinction between God and the very least of their saints. They
ask the same things from Saint Claudius which they ask from the Almighty, and
offer the prayer of our Lord to the image of Catherine. I am aware that the
Papists justify their invocation of the dead, by denying that their prayers to
them amount to divine worship. They talk so much about the kind of worship which
they call <i>latria, </i>that is, the worship which they give to God alone, as
to make it appear, that in the invocation of angels and saints they give none of
it to them.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb251</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But it is impossible to read the words
of the Psalmist, now under our consideration, without perceiving that all true
religion is gone unless God alone is called upon. Were the Papists asked whether
it were lawful to offer sacrifices to the dead, they would immediately reply in
the negative. They grant to this day that sacrifice could not lawfully be
offered to Peter or to Paul, for the common sense of mankind would dictate the
profanity of such an act. And when we here see God preferring the invocation of
his name to all sacrifices, is it not plain to demonstration, that those who
call upon the dead are chargeable with the grossest impiety? From this it
follows, that the Papists, let them abound as they may in their genuflections
before God, rob him of the chief part of his glory when they direct their
supplications to the saints.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb252</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The express mention which is made in
these verses of affliction is fitted to comfort the weak and the fearful
believer. When God has withdrawn the outward marks of his favor, a doubt is apt
to steal into our minds whether he really cares for our salvation. So far is
this from being well founded, that adversity is sent to us by God, just to stir
us up to seek him and to call upon his name. Nor should we overlook the fact,
that our prayers are only acceptable when we offer them in compliance with the
commandment of God, and are animated to them by a consideration of the promise
which he has extended. The argument which the Papists have drawn from the
passage, in support of their multiplied vows, is idle and unwarrantable. The
Psalmist, as we have already hinted, when he enjoins the payment of their vows,
refers only to solemn thanksgiving, whereas they trust in their vows as meriting
salvation. They contract vows, beside, which have no divine warrant, but, on the
contrary, are explicitly condemned by the word of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

his censures more openly against those whose whole religion lies in an
observance of ceremonies, with which they attempt to blind the eyes of God. An
exposure is made of the vanity of seeking to shelter impurity of heart and life
under a veil of outward services, a lesson which ought to have been received by
all with true consent, but which was peculiarly ungrateful to Jewish ears. It
has been universally confessed, that the worship of God is pure and acceptable
only when it proceeds from a sincere heart. The acknowledgement has been
extorted from the poets of the heathen, and it is known that the profligate were
wont to be excluded from their temples and from participation in their
sacrifices. And yet such is the influence of hypocrisy in choking and
obliterating even a sentiment so universally felt as this, that men of the most
abandoned character will obtrude themselves into the presence of God, in the
confidence of deceiving him with their vain inventions. This may explain the
frequency of the warnings which we find in the prophets upon this subject,
declaring to the ungodly again and again, that they only aggravate their guilt
by assuming the semblance of piety. Loudly as the Spirit of God has asserted,
that a form of godliness, unaccompanied by the grace of faith and repentance, is
but a sacrilegious abuse of the name of God; it is yet impossible to drive the
Papists out of the devilish delusion, that their idlest services are sanctified
by what they call their <i>final intention. </i>They grant that none but such as
are in a state of grace can possess the <i>meritum de
condigno;</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb253</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>but they maintain that the mere
outward acts of devotion, without any accompanying sentiments of the heart, may
prepare a person at least for the reception of grace. And thus, if a monk rise
from the bed of his adultery to chant a few psalms without one spark of
godliness in his breast, or if a whore-monger, a thief, or any foresworn
villain, seeks to make reparation for his crimes by mass or pilgrimage, they
would be loath to consider this lost labor. By God, on the other hand, such a
disjunction of the form from the inward sentiment of devotion is branded as
sacrilege. In the passage before us, the Psalmist sets aside and refutes a very
common objection which might be urged. Must not, it might be said, those
sacrifices be in some respect acceptable to God which are offered up in his
honor? He shows that, on the contrary, they entail guilt upon the parties who
present them, inasmuch as they lie to God, and profane his holy name. He checks
their presumption with the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What hast thou to do to declare
my statutes?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, to pretend that
you are one of my people, and that you have a part in my covenant. Now, if God
in this manner rejects the whole of that profession of godliness, which is
unaccompanied by purity of heart, how shall we expect him to treat the
observance of mere ceremonies, which hold quite an inferior place to the
declaration of the statutes of God?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Also thou hatest
correction</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here hypocrites are
challenged with treacherous duplicity in denying, by their life and their works,
that godliness which they have professed with the lip. Their contempt of God he
proves from their want of reverential deference to his Word; subjection to the
Word of God, and cordial submission to his precepts and instructions, being the
surest test of religious principle. One way in which hypocrisy usually displays
itself is, by the ingenious excuses it invents for evading the duty of
obedience. The Psalmist points to this as the mainspring of their ungodliness,
that they had cast the Word of God behind their back, while he insinuates that
the principle from which all true worship flows is the obedience of faith. He
adverts also to the cause of their perversity, which lies in the unwillingness
of their corrupt heart to suffer the yoke of God. They have no hesitation in
granting that whatever proceeds from the mouth of God is both true and right;
this honor they are willing to concede to his Word; but in so far as it proposes
to regulate their conduct, and restrain their sinful affections, they dislike
and detest it. Our corruption, indisposing us to receive correction, exasperates
us against the Word of God; nor is it possible that we can ever listen to it
with true docility and meekness of mind, till we have been brought to give
ourselves up to be ruled and disciplined by its precepts. The Psalmist next
proceeds to specify some of those works of ungodliness, informing us that
hypocrites, who were addicted to theft and adultery, mixed up and polluted the
holy name of God with their wickedness. By adverting only to some species of
vices, he would intimate, in general, that those who have despised correction,
and hardened themselves against instruction, are prepared to launch into every
excess which corrupt desire or evil example may suggests. He makes mention,
first, of thefts; then of adulteries; and, thirdly, of calumnies or false
reproaches. Most interpreters render

sufficiently with the scope of the Psalmist, and the preference may be left to
the reader's own choice. The charge here brought against hypocrites, that they

hand of God against them, are ever ready to surrender themselves to a state of
security, and nothing is more difficult than to awaken their apprehensions. By
this alarming language the Psalmist aims at convincing them of the certainty of
destruction should they longer presume upon the forbearance of God, and thus
provoke his anger the more, by imagining that he can favor the practice of sin.
The greatest dishonor which any can cast upon his name is that of impeaching his
justice. This hypocrites may not venture to do in an open manner, but in their
secret and corrupt imagination they figure God to be different from what he is,
that they may take occasion from his conceived forbearance to indulge a false
peace of mind, and escape the disquietude which they could not fail to feel were
they seriously persuaded that God was the avenger of sin. We have a sufficient
proof in the supine security which hypocrites display, that they must have
formed such false conceptions of God. They not only exclude from their thoughts
his judicial character, but think of him as the patron and approver of their
sins. The Psalmist reprehends them for abusing the goodness and clemency of God,
in the way of cherishing a vain hope that they may transgress with impunity. He
warns them, that ere long they will be dragged into the light, and that those
sins which they would have hidden from the eyes of God would be set in all their
enormity before their view. He will set the whole list of their sins in distinct
order, for so I understand the expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to set in
order</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>before their view, and force them
upon their observation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now consider this, ye
that forget God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here we have more of
that severe expostulation which is absolutely necessary in dealing with hardened
hypocrites, who otherwise will only deride all instruction. While, however, the
Psalmist threatens and intends to alarm them, he would, at the same time, hold
out to them the hope of pardon, upon their hastening to avail themselves of it.
But to prevent them from giving way to delay, he warns them of the severity, as
well as the suddenness, of the divine judgments. He also charges them with base
ingratitude, in having forgotten God. And here what a remarkable proof have we
of the grace of God in extending the hope of mercy to those corrupt men, who had
so impiously profaned his worship, who had so audaciously and sacrilegiously
mocked at his forbearance, and who had abandoned themselves to such scandalous
crimes! In calling them to repentance, without all doubt he extends to them the
hope of God being reconciled to them, that they may venture to appear in the
presence of his majesty. And can we conceive of greater clemency than this, thus
to invite to himself, and into the bosom of the Church, such perfidious
apostates and violators of his covenant, who had departed from the doctrine of
godliness in which they had been brought up? Great as it is, we would do well to
reflect that it is no greater than what we have ourselves experienced. We, too,
had apostatized from the Lord, and in his singular mercy has he brought us again
into his fold. It should not escape our notice, that the Psalmist urges them to
hasten their return, as the door of mercy will not always stand open for their
admission &#8212; a needful lesson to us all! lest we allow the day of our
merciful visitation to pass by, and be left, like Esau, to indulge in unavailing
lamentations,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012734&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
27:34.) So much is implied when it is said,

</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whoso offereth praise
will glorify me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is the third time
that the Psalmist has inculcated the truth, that the most acceptable sacrifice
in God's sight is praise, by which we express to him the gratitude of our hearts
for his blessings. The repetition is not a needless one, and that on two
accounts. In the first place, there is nothing with which we are more frequently
chargeable than forgetfulness of the benefits of the Lord. Scarcely one out of a
thousand attracts our notice; and if it does, it is only slightly, and, as it
were, in passing. And, secondly, we do not assign that importance to the duty of
praise which it deserves. We are apt to neglect it as something trivial, and
altogether commonplace; whereas it constitutes the chief exercise of godliness,
in which God would have us to be engaged during the whole of our life. In the
words before us, the sacrifice of praise is asserted to form the true and proper
worship of God. The words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will
glorify me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>imply that God is then truly
and properly worshipped, and the glory which he requires yielded to him, when
his goodness is celebrated with a sincere and grateful heart; but that all the
other sacrifices to which hypocrites attach such importance are worthless in his
estimation, and no part whatsoever of his worship. Under the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>praise</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>however, is comprehended, as I have already noticed, both faith and prayer.
There must be an experience of the goodness of the Lord before our mouths can be
opened to praise him for it, and this goodness can only be experienced by faith.
Hence it follows, that the whole of spiritual worship is comprehended under what
is either presupposed in the exercise of praise, or flows from it. Accordingly,
in the words which immediately follow, the Psalmist calls upon those who desired
that their services should be approved of God,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to order their way
aright</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By the expression here used of
<i>ordering one's way, </i>some understand repentance or confession of sin to be
meant; others, the taking out of the way such things as may prove grounds of
offense, or obstacles in the way of others. It seems more probable that the
Psalmist enjoins them to walk in the right way as opposed to that in which
hypocrites are found, and intimates that God is only to be approached by those
who seek him with a sincere heart and in an upright manner. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the salvation of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>I do not, with some, understand a
great or signal salvation. God speaks of himself in the third person, the more
clearly to satisfy them of the fact, that he would eventually prove to all his
genuine worshippers how truly he sustained the character of their
Savior.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
51</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We learn the cause which led to the composition of
this psalm from the title appended to it, and which will immediately come under
our consideration. For a long period after his melancholy fall, David would seem
to have sunk into a spiritual lethargy; but when roused from it by the
expostulation of Nathan, he was filled with self-loathing and humiliation in the
sight of God, and was anxious both to testify his repentance to all around him,
and leave some lasting proof of it to posterity. In the commencement of the
psalm, having his eyes directed to the heinousness of his guilt, he encourages
himself to hope for pardon by considering the infinite mercy of God. This he
extols in high terms, and with a variety of expressions, as one who felt that he
deserved multiplied condemnation. In the after part of the psalm, he prays for
restoration to the favor of God, being conscious that he deserved to have been
cast off for ever, and deprived of all the gifts of the Holy Spirit. He
promises, should forgiveness be bestowed upon him, to retain a deep and grateful
sense of it. Towards the conclusion, he declares it to be for the good of the
Church that God should grant his request; and, indeed, when the peculiar manner
in which God had deposited his covenant of grace with David is considered, it
could not but be felt that the common hope of the salvation of all must have
been shaken on the supposition of his final rejection.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>To the chief
musician. A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had
gone in to Bathsheba.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When Nathan the prophet came to
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Express mention is made of the
prophet having come before the psalm was written, proving, as it does, the deep
lethargy into which David must have fallen. It was a wonderful circumstance that
so great a man, and one so eminently gifted with the Spirit, should have
continued in this dangerous state for upwards of a year. Nothing but satanic
influence can account for that stupor of conscience which could lead him to
despise or slight the divine judgment, which he had incurred. It serves
additionally to mark the supineness into which he had fallen, that he seems to
have had no compunction for his sin till the prophet came to him. We have here a
striking illustration, at the same time, of the mercy of God in sending the
prophet to reclaim him when he had wandered. In this view, there is an
antithesis in the repetition of the word <i>came. </i>It was when David came in
to Bathsheba that Nathan came to him. By that sinful step he had placed himself
at a distance from God; and the Divine goodness was signally displayed in
contemplating his restoration. We do not imagine that David, during this
interval, was so wholly deprived of the sense of religion as no longer to
acknowledge the supremacy of the Divine Being. In all probability he continued
to pray daily, engaged in the acts of Divine worship, and aimed at conforming
his life to the law of God. There is no reason to think that grace was wholly
extinct in his heart; but only that he was possessed by a spirit of infatuation
upon one particular point, and labored under a fatal insensibility as to his
present exposure to Divine wrath. Grace, whatever sparks it might emit in other
directions, was smothered, so to speak, in this. Well may we tremble to
contemplate the fact, that so holy a prophet, and so excellent a king, should
have sunk into such a condition! That the sense of religion was not altogether
extinguished in his mind, is proved by the manner in which he was affected
immediately upon receiving the prophet's reproof. Had such been the case, he
could not have cried out as he did, "I have sinned against the Lord,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;101213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 12:13;) nor would he have so readily submitted himself, in the spirit of
meekness, to admonition and correction. In this respect, he has set an example
to all such as may have sinned against God, teaching them the duty of humbly
complying with the calls to repentance, which may be addressed to them by his
servants, instead of remaining under sin till they be surprised by the final
vengeance of Heaven.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
51:1-2	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1</b>. Have mercy upon me, O God:

remarked, by praying for pardon; and his sin having been of an aggravated
description, he prays with unwonted earnestness. He does not satisfy himself
with one petition. Having mentioned the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>loving-kindness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of the Lord, he adds </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
multitude of his compassions</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>to
intimate that mercy of an ordinary kind would not suffice for so great a sinner.
Had he prayed God to be favorable, simply according to his clemency or goodness,
even that would have amounted to a confession that his case was a bad one; but
when he speaks of his sin as remissible, only through the countless multitude of
the compassions of God, he represents it as peculiarly atrocious. There is an
implied antithesis between the greatness of the mercies sought for, and the
greatness of the transgression which required them. Still more emphatical is the
expression which follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>multiply to wash

too great a departure from the idiom of the language. The sense, on that
supposition, would indeed remain the same, That God would wash him abundantly,
and with multiplied washing; but I prefer that form of expression which agrees
best with the Hebrew idiom. This, at least, is certain from the expression which
he employs, that he felt the stain of his sin to be deep, and to require
multiplied washings. Not as if God could experience any difficulty in cleansing
the worst sinner, but the more aggravated a man's sin is, the more earnest
naturally are his desires to be delivered from the terrors of
conscience.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The figure itself, as all are aware,
is one of frequent occurrence in Scripture. Sin resembles filth or uncleanness,

of it is therefore aptly compared to

us with detestation of sin. Insensible, indeed, must that heart be which is not

fb260</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He now discovers his reason for
imploring pardon with so much vehemency, and this was the painful disquietude
which his sins<i> </i>caused him, and which could only be relieved by his
obtaining reconciliation with God. This proves that his prayer did not proceed
from dissimulation, as many will be found commending the grace of God in high
terms, although, in reality, they care little about it, having never felt the
bitterness of being exposed to his displeasure. David, on the contrary, declares
that he is subjected by his sin to constant anguish of mind, and that it is this
which imparts such an earnestness to his supplications. From his example we may
learn who they are that can alone be said to seek reconciliation with God in a
proper manner. They are such as have had their consciences wounded with a sense
of sin, and who can find no rest until they have obtained assurance of his
mercy. We will never seriously apply to God for pardon, until we have obtained
such a view of our sins as inspires us with fear. The more easily satisfied we
are under our sins, the more do we provoke God to punish them with severity, and
if we really desire absolution from his hand, we must do more than confess our
guilt in words; we must institute a rigid and formidable scrutiny into the
character of our transgressions. David does not simply say that he will confess
his sins to man, but declares that he has a deep inward feeling of them, such a
feeling of them as filled him with the keenest anguish. His was a very different
spirit from that of the hypocrite, who displays a complete indifference upon
this subject, or when it intrudes upon him, endeavors to bury the recollection
of it. He speaks of his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sins</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>in the plural number. His transgression, although it sprung from one root,
was complicated, including, besides adultery, treachery and cruelty; nor was it
one man only whom he had betrayed, but the whole army which had been summoned to
the field in defense of the Church of God. He accordingly recognises many
particular sins as wrapt up in it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Against thee, thee only,
have I
sinned</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb261</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is the opinion of some that
he here adverts to the circumstance of his sin, although it was committed
against man, being concealed from every eye but that of God. None was aware of
the double wrong which he had inflicted upon Uriah, nor of the wanton manner in
which he had exposed his army to danger; and his crime being thus unknown to
men, might be said to have been committed exclusively against God. According to
others, David here intimates, that however deeply he was conscious of having
injured men, he was chiefly distressed for having violated the law of God. But I
conceive his meaning to be, that though all the world should pardon him, he felt
that God was the Judge with whom he had to do, that conscience hailed him to his
bar, and that the voice of man could administer no relief to him, however much
he might be disposed to forgive, or to excuse, or to flatter. His eyes and his
whole soul were directed to God, regardless of what man might think or say
concerning him. To one who is thus overwhelmed with a sense of the dreadfulness
of being obnoxious to the sentence of God, there needs no other accuser. God is
to him instead of a thousand. There is every reason to believe that David, in
order to prevent his mind from being soothed into a false peace by the
flatteries of his court, realised the judgment of God upon his offense, and felt
that this was in itself an intolerable burden, even supposing that he should
escape all trouble from the hands of his fellow-creatures. This will be the
exercise of every true penitent. It matters little to obtain our acquittal at
the bar of human judgment, or to escape punishment through the connivance of
others, provided we suffer from an accusing conscience and an offended God. And
there is, perhaps, no better remedy against deception in the matter of our sins
than to turn our thoughts inward upon ourselves, to concentrate them upon God,
and lose every self-complacent imagination in a sharp sense of his displeasure.
By a violent process of interpretation, some would have us read the second
clause of this verse, <i>That
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou mayest be justified when
thou speakest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>in connection with the
first verse of the psalm, and consider that it cannot be referred to the
sentence immediately preceding.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb262</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But not to say that this breaks in upon
the order of the verses, what sense could any attach to the prayer as it would
then run, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>have mercy upon me,
that thou mayest be clear when thou judgest?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>etc. Any doubt upon the meaning of the words, however, is completely removed
by the connection in which they are cited in Paul's Epistle to the
Romans,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"For what if some did not
believe? Shall God be unjust? God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a
liar; as it is written, That thou mayest be justified in thy sayings, and
mightest overcome when thou art judged." &#8212;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
3:3, 4</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here the words before us are quoted in
proof of the doctrine that God's righteousness is apparent even in the sins of
men, and his truth in their falsehood. To have a clear apprehension of their
meaning, it is necessary that we reflect upon the covenant which God had made
with David. The salvation of the whole world having been in a certain sense
deposited with him by this covenant, the enemies of religion might take occasion
to exclaim upon his fall, "Here is the pillar of the Church gone, and what is
now to become of the miserable remnant whose hopes rested upon his holiness?
Once nothing could be more conspicuous than the glory by which he was
distinguished, but mark the depth of disgrace to which he has been reduced! Who,
after so gross a fall, would look for salvation from his seed?" Aware that such
attempts might be made to impugn the righteousness of God, David takes this
opportunity of justifying it, and charging himself with the whole guilt of the
transaction. He declares that God was justified
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>when he
spoke</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> &#8212; </i>not<i> </i>when he spoke
the promises of the covenant, although some have so understood the words, but
justified should he have spoken the sentence of condemnation against him for his
sin, as he might have done but for his gratuitous mercy. Two forms of expression
are here employed which have the same meaning,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that thou mayest be justified
when thou speakest, and be clear when thou
judgest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As Paul, in the quotation
already referred to, has altered the latter clause, and may even seem to have
given a new turn to the sentiment contained in the verse, I shall briefly show
how the words were applicable to the purpose for which they were cited by him.
He adduces them to prove that God's faithfulness remained unaffected by the fact
that the Jews had broken his covenant, and fallen from the grace which he had
promised. Now, at first sight it may not appear how they contain the proof
alleged. But their appositeness will at once be seen if we reflect upon the
circumstance to which I have already adverted. Upon the fall of one who was so
great a pillar in the Church, so illustrious both as a prophet and a king, as
David, we cannot but believe that many were shaken and staggered in the faith of
the promises. Many must have been disposed to conclude, considering the close
connection into which God had adopted David, that he was implicated in some
measure in his fall. David, however, repels an insinuation so injurious to the
divine honor, and declares, that although God should cast him headlong into
everlasting destruction, his mouth would be shut, or opened only to acknowledge
his unimpeachable justice. The sole departure which the apostle has made from
the passage in his quotation consists in his using the verb <i>to judge </i>in a
passive sense, and reading, <i>that thou mightest overcome, </i>instead of,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that thou mightest be
clear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In this he follows the
Septuagint,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb263</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and it is well known that the apostles
do not study verbal exactness in their quotations from the Old Testament. It is
enough for us to be satisfied, that the passage answers the purpose for which it
was adduced by the apostle. The general doctrine which we are taught from the
passage is, that whatever sins men may commit are chargeable entirely upon
themselves, and never can implicate the righteousness of God. Men are ever ready
to arraign his administration, when it does not correspond with the judgment of
sense and human reason. But should God at any time raise persons from the depth
of obscurity to the highest distinction, or, on the other hand, allow persons
who occupied a most conspicuous station to be suddenly precipitated from it, we
should learn from the example which is here set before us to judge of the divine
procedure with sobriety, modesty, and reverence and to rest satisfied that it is
holy, and that the works of God, as well as his words, are characterised by
unerring rectitude. The conjunction in the verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that-that thou mayest be
justified</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>denotes not so much cause as
consequence. It was not the fall of David, properly speaking, which caused the
glory of God's righteousness to appear. And yet, although men when they sin seem
to obscure his righteousness, it emerges from the foul attempt only more bright
than ever, it being the peculiar work of God to bring light out of
darkness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I was born in
iniquity,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>etc<i>. </i>He now proceeds
further than the mere acknowledgement of one or of many sins, confessing that he
brought nothing but sin with him into the world, and that his nature was
entirely depraved. He is thus led by the consideration of one offense of
peculiar atrocity to the conclusion that he was born in iniquity, and was
absolutely destitute of all spiritual good. Indeed, every sin should convince us
of the general truth of the corruption of our nature. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yntmjy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>yechemathni, </i>signifies literally, <i>hath warmed herself of me, </i>from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;jy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>yacham, </i>or
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;mj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chamam, to warm; </i>but interpreters have very properly rendered it <i>hath
conceived me. </i>The expression intimates that we are cherished in sin from the
first moment that we are in the womb. David, then, is here brought, by
reflecting on one particular transgression, to east a retrospective glance upon
his whole past life, and to discover nothing but sin in it. And let us not
imagine that he speaks of the corruption of his nature, merely as hypocrites
will occasionally do, to excuse their faults, saying, "I have sinned it may be,
but what could I do? We are men, and prone by nature to everything which is
evil." David has recourse to no such stratagems for evading the sentence of God,
and refers to original sin with the view of aggravating his guilt, acknowledging
that he had not contracted this or that sin for the first time lately, but had
been born into the world with the seed of every
iniquity.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The passage affords a striking
testimony in proof of original sin entailed by Adam upon the whole human family.
It not only teaches the doctrine, but may assist us in forming a correct idea of
it. The Pelagians, to avoid what they considered the absurdity of holding that
all were ruined through one man's transgression, maintained of old, that sin
descended from Adam only through force of imitation. But the Bible, both in this
and other places, clearly asserts that we are born in sin, and that it exists
within us as a disease fixed in our nature. David does not charge it upon his
parents, nor trace his crime to them, but sists himself before the Divine
tribunal, confesses that he was formed in sin, and that he was a transgressor
ere he saw the light of this world. It was therefore a gross error in Pelagius
to deny that sin was hereditary, descending in the human family by contagion.
The Papists, in our own day, grant that the nature of man has become depraved,
but they extenuate original sin as much as possible, and represent it as
consisting merely in an inclination to that which is evil. They restrict its
seat besides to the inferior part of the soul and the gross appetites; and while
nothing is more evident from experience than that corruption adheres to men
through life, they deny that it remains in them subsequently to baptism. We have
no adequate idea of the dominion of sin, unless we conceive of it as extending
to every part of the soul, and acknowledge that both the mind and heart of man
have become utterly corrupt. The language of David sounds very differently from
that of the Papists, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I was formed
in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He says nothing of his grosser
appetites, but asserts that sin cleaved by nature to every part of him without
exception.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here the question has been started,
How sin is transmitted from the parents to the children? And this question has
led to another regarding the transmission of the soul, many denying that
corruption can be derived from the parent to the child, except on the
supposition of one soul being begotten of the substance of another. Without
entering upon such mysterious discussions, it is enough that we hold, that Adam,
upon his fall, was despoiled of his original righteousness, his reason darkened,
his will perverted, and that, being reduced to this state of corruption, he
brought children into the world resembling himself in character. Should any
object that generation is confined to bodies, and that souls can never derive
anything in common from one another, I would reply, that Adam, when he was
endued at his creation with the gifts of the Spirit, did not sustain a private
character, but represented all mankind, who may be considered as having been
endued with these gifts in his person; and from this view it necessarily follows
that when he fell, we all forfeited along with him our original
integrity.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, thou hast desired
truth,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>etc<i>. </i>This verse confirms
the remark which we already made, that David was far from seeking to invent an
apology for his sin, when he traced it back to the period of his conception, and
rather intended by this to acknowledge that from his very infancy he was an heir
of eternal death. He thus represents his whole life to have been obnoxious to
condemnation. So far is he from imitating those who arraign God as the author of
sin, and impiously suggest that he might have given man a better nature, that in
the verse now before us he opposes God's judgment to our corruption,
insinuating, that every time we appear before him, we are certain of being
condemned, inasmuch as we are born in sin, while he delights in holiness and
uprightness. He goes further, and asserts, that in order to meet the approval of
God, it is not enough that our lives be conformed to the letter of his law,
unless our heart be clean and purified from all guile. He tells us that God
desires truth in </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the inward
parts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb265</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>intimating to us, that secret as
well as outward and gross sins excite his displeasure. In the second clause of
the verse, he aggravates his offense by confessing that he could not plead the
excuse of ignorance. He had been sufficiently instructed by God in his duty.
Some interpret
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;wtsb</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>besathum, </i>as if he here declared that God had discovered secret mysteries
to him, or things hidden from the human understanding. He seems rather to mean
that wisdom had been discovered to his mind in a secret and intimate
manner.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb266</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The one member of the verse responds to
the other. He acknowledges that it was not a mere superficial acquaintance with
divine truth which he had enjoyed, but that it had been closely brought home to
his heart. This rendered his offense the more inexcusable. Though privileged so
highly with the saving knowledge of the truth, he had plunged into the
commission of brutish sin, and by various acts of iniquity had almost ruined his
soul.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We have thus set before us the exercise of
the Psalmist at this time. First, we have seen that he is brought to a
confession of the greatness of his offense: this leads him to a sense of the
complete depravity of his nature: to deepen his convictions, he then directs his
thoughts to the strict judgment of God, who looks not to the outward appearance
but the heart; and, lastly, he adverts to the peculiarity of his case, as one
who had enjoyed no ordinary measure of the gifts of the Spirit, and deserved on
that account the severer punishment. The exercise is such as we should all
strive to imitate. Are we conscious of having committed any one sin, let it be
the means of recalling others to our recollection, until we are brought to
prostrate ourselves before God in deep self-abasement. And if it has been our
privilege to enjoy the special teaching of the Spirit of God, we ought to feel
that our guilt is additionally heavy, having sinned in this case against light,
and having trampled under foot the precious gifts with which we were
intrusted.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
51:7-9	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7</b>. Thou shalt purge me with

</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt purge me with
hyssop</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He still follows out the same
strain of supplication; and the repetition of his requests for pardon proves how
earnestly he desired it. He speaks of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hyssop</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb267</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>in allusion to the ceremonies
of the law; and though he was far from putting his trust in the mere outward
symbol of purification, he knew that, like every other legal rite, it was
instituted for an important end. The sacrifices were seals of the grace of God.
In them, therefore, he was anxious to find assurance of his reconciliation; and
it is highly proper that, when our faith is disposed at any time to waver, we
should confirm it by improving such means of divine support. All which David
here prays for is, that God would effectually accomplish, in his experience,
what he had signified to his Church and people by these outward rites; and in
this he has set us a good example for our imitation. It is no doubt to the blood
of Christ alone that we must look for the atonement of our sins; but we are
creatures of sense, who must see with our eyes, and handle with our hands; and
it is only by improving the outward symbols of propitiation that we can arrive
at a full and assured persuasion of it. What we have said of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hyssop</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>applies also to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>washings</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb268</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> referred to in this verse, and which
were commonly practiced under the Law. They figuratively represented our being
purged from all iniquity, in order to our reception into the divine favor. I
need not say that it is the peculiar work of the Holy Spirit to sprinkle our
consciences inwardly with the blood of Christ, and, by removing the sense of
guilt, to secure our access into the presence of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the two verses which follow, the
Psalmist prays that God would be pacified towards him. Those put too confined a
meaning upon the words who have suggested that, in praying
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to hear the voice of joy and
gladness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he requests some prophet to be
sent, who might assure him of pardon. He prays, in general, for testimonies of
the divine favor. When he speaks of his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bones</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>as having been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>broken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he alludes to the extreme grief and overwhelming distress to which he had
been reduced. The joy of the Lord would reanimate his soul; and this joy he
describes as to be obtained by <i>hearing; </i>for it is the word of God alone
which can first and effectually cheer the heart of any sinner. There is no true
or solid peace to be enjoyed in the world except in the way of reposing upon the
promises of God. Those who do not resort to them may succeed for a time in
hushing or evading the terrors of conscience, but they must ever be strangers to
true inward comfort. And, granting that they may attain to the peace of
insensibility, this is not a state which could satisfy any man who has seriously
felt the fear of the Lord. The joy which he desires is that which flows from
hearing the word of God, in which he promises to pardon our guilt, and readmit
us into his favor. It is this alone which supports the believer amidst all the
fears, dangers, and distresses of his earthly pilgrimage; for the joy of the
Spirit is inseparable from faith. When God is said, in the 9th verse, to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hide his
face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>from our sins, this signifies his
pardoning them, as is explained in the clause immediately annexed<i> &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Blot out all my
sins.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This represents our justification
as consisting in a voluntary act of God, by which he condescends to forget all
our iniquities; and it represents our cleansing to consist in the reception of a
gratuitous pardon. We repeat the remark which has been already made, that David,
in thus reiterating his one request for the mercy of God, evinces the depth of
that anxiety which he felt for a favor which his conduct had rendered difficult
of attainment. The man who prays for pardon in a mere formal manner, is proved
to be a stranger to the dreadful desert of sin. "Happy is the man," said
Solomon, "that<i> </i>feareth alway,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;202814&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
28:14.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">But here it may be asked why David
needed to pray so earnestly for the joy of remission, when he had already
received assurance from the lips of Nathan that his sin was pardoned?
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;101213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 12:13.) Why did he not embrace this absolution? and was he not chargeable
with dishonoring God by disbelieving the word of his prophet? We cannot expect
that God will send us angels in order to announce the pardon which we require.
Was it not said by Christ, that whatever his disciples remitted on earth would
be remitted in heaven?
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;432023&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
20:23.) And does not the apostle declare that ministers of the gospel are
ambassadors to reconcile men to God?
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 5:20.) From this it might appear to have argued unbelief in David,
that, notwithstanding the announcement of Nathan, he should evince a remaining
perplexity or uncertainty regarding his forgiveness. There is a twofold
explanation which may be given of the difficulty. We may hold that Nathan did
not immediately make him aware of the fact that God was willing to be reconciled
to him. In Scripture, it is well known, things are not always stated according
to the strict order of time in which they occurred. It is quite conceivable
that, having thrown him into this situation of distress, God might keep him in
it for a considerable interval, for his deeper humiliation; and that David
expresses in these verses the dreadful anguish which he endured when challenged
with his crime, and not yet informed of the divine determination to pardon it.
Let us take the other supposition, however, and it by no means follows that a
person may not be assured of the favor of God, and yet show great earnestness
and importunity in praying for pardon. David might be much relieved by the
announcement of the prophet, and yet be visited occasionally with fresh
convictions, influencing him to have recourse to the throne of grace. However
rich and liberal the offers of mercy may be which God extends to us, it is
highly proper on our part that we should reflect upon the grievous dishonor
which we have done to his name, and be filled with due sorrow on account of it.
Then our faith is weak, and we cannot at once apprehend the full extent of the
divine mercy; so that there is no reason to be surprised that David should have
once and again renewed his prayers for pardon, the more to confirm his belief in
it. The truth is, that we cannot properly pray for the pardon of sin until we
have come to a persuasion that God will be reconciled to us. Who can venture to
open his mouth in God's presence unless he be assured of his fatherly favor? And
pardon being the first thing we should pray for, it is plain that there is no
inconsistency in having a persuasion of the grace of God, and yet proceeding to
supplicate his forgiveness. In proof of this, I might refer to the Lord's
Prayer, in which we are taught to begin by addressing God as our Father, and yet
afterwards to pray for the remission of our sins. God's pardon is full and
complete; but our faith cannot take in his overflowing goodness, and it is
necessary that it should distil to us drop by drop. It is owing to this
infirmity of our faith, that we are often found repeating and repeating again
the same petition, not with the view surely of gradually softening the heart of
God to compassion, but because we advance by slow and difficult steps to the
requisite fullness of assurance. The mention which is here made of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>purging with
hyssop</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and of <i>washing </i>or
<i>sprinkling, </i>teaches us, in all our prayers for the pardon of sin, to have
our thoughts directed to the great sacrifice by which Christ has reconciled us
to God. "Without shedding of blood," says Paul, "is no remissions"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580922&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
9:22 ;) and this, which was intimated by God to the ancient Church under
figures, has been fully made known by the coming of Christ. The sinner, if he
would find mercy, must look to the sacrifice of Christ, which expiated the sins
of the world, glancing, at the same time, for the confirmation of his faith, to
Baptism and the Lord's Supper; for it were vain to imagine that God, the Judge
of the world, would receive us again into his favor in any other way than
through a satisfaction made to his
justice.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Create in me a clean heart, O
God!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In the previous part of the psalm
David has been praying for pardon. He now requests that the grace of the Spirit,
which he had forfeited, or deserved to have forfeited, might be restored to him.
The two requests are quite distinct, though sometimes confounded together, even
by men of learning. He passes from the subject of the gratuitous remission of
sin to that of sanctification. And to this he was naturally led with earnest
anxiety, by the consciousness of his having merited the loss of all the gifts of
the Spirit, and of his having actually, in a great measure, lost them. By
employing the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>create</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he expresses his persuasion that nothing less than a miracle could effect
his reformation, and emphatically declares that repentance is the gift of God.
The Sophists grant the necessity of the aids of the Spirit, and allow that
assisting grace must both go before and come after; but by assigning a middle
place to the free will of man, they rob God of a great part of his glory. David,
by the word which he here uses, describes the work of God in renewing the heart
in a manner suitable to its extraordinary nature, representing it as the
formation of a new creature.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As he had already
been endued with the Spirit, he prays in the latter part of the verse that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God would renew a right spirit
within him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But by the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>create</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>which he had previously employed, he acknowledges that we are indebted
entirely to the grace of God, both for our first regeneration, and, in the event
of our falling, for subsequent restoration. He does not merely assert that his
heart and spirit were weak, requiring divine assistance, but that they must
remain destitute of all purity and rectitude till these be communicated from
above. By this it appears that our nature is entirely corrupt: for were it
possessed of any rectitude or purity, David would not, as in this verse, have
called the one <i>a gift of the Spirit, </i>and the other <i>a
creation.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino">In the verse which follows, he
presents the same petition, in language which implies the connection of pardon
with the enjoyment of the leading of the Holy Spirit. If God reconcile us
gratuitously to himself, it follows that he will guide us by the Spirit of
adoption. It is only such as he loves, and has numbered among his own children,
that he blesses with a share of his Spirit; and David shows that he was sensible
of this when he prays for the continuance of the grace of adoption as
indispensable to the continued possession of the Spirit. The words of this verse
imply that the Spirit had not altogether been taken away from him, however much
his gifts had been temporarily obscured. Indeed, it is evident that he could not
be altogether divested of his former excellencies, for he seems to have
discharged his duties as a king with credit, to have conscientiously observed
the ordinances of religion, and to have regulated his conduct by the divine law.
Upon one point he had fallen into a deadly lethargy, but he was not given over
to a reprobate mind;" and it is scarcely conceivable that the rebuke of Nathan
the prophet should have operated so easily and so suddenly in arousing him, had
there been no latent spark of godliness still remaining in his soul. He prays,
it is true, that his spirit may be <i>renewed, </i>but this must be understood
with a limitation. The truth on which we are now insisting is an important one,
as many learned men have been inconsiderately drawn into the opinion that the
elect, by falling into mortal sin, may lose the Spirit altogether, and be
alienated from God. The contrary is clearly declared by Peter, who tells us that
the word by which we are born again is an incorruptible seed,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600123&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 1:23;) and John is equally explicit in informing us that the elect are
preserved from falling away altogether,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;620309&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 3:9.) However much they may appear for a time to have been cast off by God,
it is afterwards seen that grace must have been alive in their breast, even
during that interval when it seemed to be extinct. Nor is there any force in the
objection that David speaks as if he feared that he might be deprived of the
Spirit. It is natural that the saints, when they have fallen into sin, and have
thus done what they could to expel the grace of God, should feel an anxiety upon
this point; but it is their duty to hold fast the truth that grace is the
incorruptible seed of God, which never can perish in any heart where it has been
deposited. This is the spirit displayed by David. Reflecting upon his offense,
he is agitated with fears, and yet rests in the persuasion that, being a child
of God, he would not be deprived of what indeed he had justly
forfeited.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12<i>.</i>
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Restore unto me the joy of
thy salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He cannot dismiss his
grief of mind until he have obtained peace with God. This he declares once and
again, for David had no sympathy with those who can indulge themselves in ease
when they are lying under the divine displeasure. In the latter clause of the
verse, he prays as in the verses preceding, that the Holy Spirit might not be
taken away from him. There is a slight ambiguity in the words. Some take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ynkmst</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>thismecheni, </i>to be the third person of the verb, because
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jwr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ruach, </i>is feminine, and translate, <i>let the Spirit uphold me. </i>The
difference is immaterial, and does not affect the meaning of the passage. There
is more difficulty in fixing the sense of the epithet
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hbydn</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
nedibah, </i>which I have translated
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>free</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>As the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bdn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nadab, </i>signifies <i>to deal liberally, </i>princes are in the Hebrew
called, by way of eminence,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ybydn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nedibim, </i>which has led several learned men to think that David speaks

Septuagint rendered it accordingly
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">hJgemonikon</font><font face="Palatino">.
The prayer, in this sense, would no doubt be a suitable one for David, who was a
king, and required a heroical courage for the execution of his office. But it
seems better to adopt the more extensive meaning, and to suppose that David,
under a painful consciousness of the bondage to which he had been reduced by a
sense of guilt, prays for a free and cheerful
spirit.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon"> fb270

unfounded hopes, and what a severe struggle he sustained with inward terrors.

blood of Uriah, and, in general, of the whole
army.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

considered as alluding to the sentence of death, to which he felt himself to be
obnoxious, and from which he requests deliverance. By <i>the righteousness of
God, </i>which he engages to celebrate, we are to understand his goodness; for
this attribute, as usually ascribed to God in the Scriptures, does not so much
denote the strictness with which he exacts vengeance, as his faithfulness in
fulfilling the promises and extending help to all who seek<i> </i>him in the
hour of need. There is much emphasis and vehemency in the mode of his address,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O God! the God of my
salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>intimating at once how
tremblingly he was alive to the danger of his situation, and how strongly his
faith terminated upon God as the ground of his hope. Similar is the strain of
the verse which follows. He prays that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his lips may be
opened</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>in other words, that God would
afford him matter of praise. The meaning usually attached to the expression is,
that God would so direct his tongue by the Spirit as to fit him for singing his
praises. But though it is true that God must supply us with words, and that if
he do not, we cannot fail to be silent in his praise, David seems rather to
intimate that his mouth must be shut until God called him to the exercise of
thanksgiving by extending pardon. In another place we find him declaring that a
new song had been put in his mouth,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;194003&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

opened. He again signifies the gratitude which he would feel, and which he would
express, intimating, that he sought the mercy of God with no other view than
that he might become the herald of it to others.

expresses his confidence of obtaining pardon, although he brought nothing to God
in the shape of compensation, but relied entirely upon the riches of Divine
mercy. He confesses that he comes to God both poor and needy; but is persuaded
that this will not prevent the success of his suit, because God attaches no
importance to sacrifices. In this he indirectly reproves the Jews for an error
which prevailed amongst them in all ages. In proclaiming that the sacrifices
made expiation for sin, the Law had designed to withdraw them from all trust in
their own works to the one satisfaction of Christ; but they presumed to bring
their sacrifices to the altar as a price by which they hoped to procure their
own redemption. In opposition to this proud and preposterous notion, David
declares that God had no delight in
sacrifices,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon"> fb273
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">and that he had nothing to present which
could purchase his favor. God had enjoined the observance of sacrifice, and
David was far from neglecting it. He is not to be understood as asserting that
the rite might warrantably be omitted, or that God would absolutely reject the
sacrifices of his own institution, which, along with the other ceremonies of the
Law, proved important helps, as we have already observed, both to David and the
whole Church of God. He speaks of them as observed by the proud and the
ignorant, under an impression of meriting the divine favor. Diligent as he was,
therefore, in the practice of sacrifice, resting his whole dependence upon the
satisfaction of Christ, who atoned for the sins of the world, he could yet
honestly declare that he brought nothing to God in the shape of compensation,
and that he trusted entirely to a gratuitous reconciliation. The Jews, when they
presented their sacrifices, could not be said to bring anything of their own to
the Lord, but must rather be viewed as borrowing from Christ the necessary
purchase-money of redemption. They were passive, not active, in this divine
service.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17<i>.</i>
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The sacrifices of God are a
broken spirit.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He had shown that
sacrifices have no such efficacy in procuring the Divine favor as the Jews
imagined; and now he declares that he needed to bring nothing whatever to God
but a contrite and humbled heart. Nothing more is necessary, on the part of the
sinner, than to prostrate himself in supplication for Divine mercy. The plural
number is used in the verse to express more forcibly the truth, that the
sacrifice of repentance is enough in itself without any other. Had he said no
more than that this kind of sacrifice was peculiarly acceptable to God, the Jews
might easily have evaded his argument by alleging that this might be true, and
yet other sacrifices be equally agreeable in his sight; just as the Papists in
our own day mix up the grace of God with their own works, rather than submit to
receive a gratuitous pardon for their sins. In order to exclude every idea of a
pretended satisfaction, David represents contrition of heart as comprehending in
itself the whole sum of acceptable sacrifices. And in using the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sacrifices of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he conveys a tacit reproof to the
proud hypocrite, who sets a high value upon such sacrifices as are of his own
unauthorised fancy, when he imagines that by means of them he can propitiate
God. But here a difficulty may be started. "If the contrite heart," it may be
said, "hold a higher place in the estimation of God than all sacrifices, does it
not follow that we acquire pardon by our penitence, and that thus it ceases to
be gratuitous?" In reply to this, I might observe, that David is not speaking at
this time of the meritorious condition by which pardon is procured, but, on the
contrary, asserting our absolute destitution of merit by enjoining humiliation
and contrition of spirit, in opposition to everything like an attempt to render
a compensation to God. The man of broken spirit is one who has been emptied of
all vain-glorious confidence, and brought to acknowledge that he is nothing. The
contrite heart abjures the idea of merit, and has no dealings with God upon the
principle of exchange. Is it objected, that faith is a more excellent sacrifice
that that which is here commended by the Psalmist, and of greater efficacy in
procuring the Divine favor, as it presents to the view of God that Savior who is
the true and only propitiation? I would observe, that faith cannot be separated
from the humility of which David speaks. This is such a humility as is
altogether unknown to the wicked. They may tremble in the presence of God, and
the obstinacy and rebellion of their hearts may be partially restrained, but
they still retain some remainders of inward pride. Where the spirit has been
broken, on the other hand, and the heart has become contrite, through a felt
sense of the anger of the Lord, a man is brought to genuine fear and
self-loathing, with a deep conviction that of himself he can do or deserve
nothing, and must be indebted unconditionally for salvation to Divine mercy.
That this should be represented by David as constituting all which God desires
in the shape of sacrifice, need not excite our surprise. He does not exclude
faith, he does not condescend upon any nice division of true penitence into its
several parts, but asserts in general, that the only way of obtaining the favor
of God is by prostrating ourselves with a wounded heart at the feet of his
Divine mercy, and supplicating his grace with ingenuous confessions of our own
helplessness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18<i>.

fb274</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>From prayer in his own behalf he
now proceeds to offer up supplications for the collective Church of God, a duty
which he may have felt to be the more incumbent upon him from the circumstance
of his having done what he could by his fall to ruin it, Raised to the throne,
and originally anointed to be king for the very purpose of fostering the Church
of God, he had by his disgraceful conduct nearly accomplished its destruction.
Although chargeable with this guilt, he now prays that God would restore it in
the exercise of his free mercy. He makes no mention of the righteousness of
others, but rests his plea entirely upon the good pleasure of God, intimating
that the Church, when at any period it has been brought low, must be indebted
for its restoration solely to Divine grace. Jerusalem was already built, but
David prays that God would build it still farther for he knew that it fell far
short of being complete, so long as it wanted the temple, where he had promised
to establish the Ark of his Covenant, and also the royal palace. We learn from
the passage, that it is God's own work to build the Church. "His<i>
</i>foundation," says the Psalmist elsewhere, "is in the holy mountains,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;198701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
87:1.) We are not to imagine that David refers simply to the Church as a
material structure, but must consider him as having his eye fixed upon the
spiritual temple, which cannot be raised by human skill or industry. It is true,
indeed, that men will not make progress even in the building of material walls,
unless their labor be blessed from above; but the Church is in a peculiar sense
the erection of God, who has founded it upon the earth in the exercise of his
mighty power, and who will exalt it higher than the heavens. In this prayer
David does not contemplate the welfare of the Church for a short period merely,
but prays that God would preserve and advance it till the coming of Christ. And
here, may it not justly excite our surprise, to find one who, in the preceding
part of the psalm, had employed the language of distress and almost of despair,
now inspired with the confidence necessary for commending the whole Church to
the care of God? How comes it about, may we not ask, that one who so narrowly
escaped destruction himself, should now appear as a guide to conduct others to
salvation? In this we have a striking proof, that, provided we obtain
reconciliation with God, we may not only expect to be inspired with confidence
in praying for our own salvation, but may hope to be admitted as intercessors in
behalf of others, and even to be advanced to the higher honor still, of
commending into the hands of God the glory of the Redeemer's
kingdom.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19<i>.

words there is an apparent, but only an apparent, inconsistency with others
which he had used in the preceding context. He had declared sacrifices to be of
no value when considered in themselves, but now he acknowledges them to be

thanksgiving. He calls them distinctly

by his example to the exercise of gratitude, and to the expression of it openly
in the solemn assembly. Besides sacrifices in general, two particular kinds of
sacrifice are specified. Although some consider

sacrifice, because in it the offering was consumed or burnt with
fire.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb275</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In the enumeration which he makes,
David designs to teach us that none of all the legal rites can find acceptance
with God, unless they be used with a reference to the proper end of their
institution. The whole of this verse has been figuratively applied by some to
the kingdom of Christ, but the interpretation is unnatural and too refined.

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;281402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
52</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This psalm was composed by David at the time when the
death of Abimelech and the other priests had spread universal tenor among the
people, indisposing them for lending any countenance to his cause, and when Doeg
was triumphing in the successful issue of his information. Supported, even in
these circumstances, by the elevating influence of faith, he inveighs against
the cruel treachery of that unprincipled informer, and encourages himself by the
reflection, that God, who is judge in heaven, will vindicate the interests of
such as fear him, and punish the pride of the ungodly.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>To the chief
singer. A Psalm of David for instruction; when Doeg the Edomite came and told
Saul, and said unto him, that David had come into the house of
Abimelech.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I have already had occasion to observe that the term
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lyk&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>maskil, </i>is strictly affixed to those psalms in which David makes mention
of having been chastised by God, or at least admonished, by some species of
affliction, sent, like the rod of the schoolmaster, to administer correction. Of
this we have examples in Psalms 32 and 42. As inscribed above the 45th psalm,
its meaning is somewhat different. There, it seems designed to intimate to the
reader that the song, although breathing of love, was not intended to please a
mere wanton taste, but describes the spiritual marriage of Christ with his
Church. In this and the following psalms, the term admits of being understood as
signifying <i>instruction, </i>more particularly such as proceeds from
<i>correction; </i>and David, by employing it, would evidently insinuate that he
was at this time subjected to peculiar trials, sent to instruct him in the duty
of placing an absolute trust in God. The portion of history to which the psalm
refers is well known. When David had fled to Abimelech in Nob, he obtained
provisions and the sword of Goliath from the hands of that priest, having
concealed from him the real danger in which he stood, and pretended that he was
executing a secret and important business of the king. Doeg, chief of the king's
herdsmen, having conveyed intelligence of this to Saul, in expectation of a
reward, was the means of drawing down the rage of the tyrant, not only upon that
innocent individual, but the whole
priesthood.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb276</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The bloody example which was thus made
must have deterred the people from extending to David even the commonest offices
of humanity, and every avenue of relief seemed shut upon the miserable exile. As
Doeg triumphed in the success of his crime, and others might be tempted, by the
reward which he had received, to meditate the ruin of David, we find him in this
psalm animating his soul with divine consolations, and challenging his enemies
with the audacity of their
conduct.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
52:1-4	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1</b>. Why boastest thou of thy

tongue!	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why boastest thou of thy
wickedness? </i></font><font face="Palatino">The success which crowned the
treachery of Doeg must have tended considerably to stagger David's faith; and he
seems to have adopted the strain of holy defiance with which the psalm
commences, in order to arm himself more effectually against this temptation. He
begins by charging Doeg with an aggravation of his guilt, in boasting of the
power which he had acquired by an act of consummate villany. This power may have
been sufficiently considerable to attract the notice which is here taken of it;
for although he is only said to have been "master of the king's herdsmen," the
designation does not imply that he was personally occupied in herding cattle,
but may have been an honorary title; as in modern courts we speak of "The Master
of the Horse." he is reminded that there was no reason why he should applaud
himself in his greatness, so long as he abused it to purposes of wickedness; nor
why he should be vain of any new honor which the king might have conferred upon
him in consideration of his late crime, as integrity is the only sure pathway to
power and preferment. Any triumph which may be obtained by violence, treachery,
or other unjustifiable means, is short-lived. In the second part of the verse,
he points at the true cause of the blindness and stupidity that lead men to
glory in their wickedness, which is, that they despise the poor and the humble;
imagine that God will not condescend to interest himself in their behalf; and
therefore embrace the occasion of oppressing them with impunity. They make no
account of that providence which God exerts over his own children. David, in the
exercise of a holy confidence, challenges such proud boasters with dishonoring
the goodness of God; and as the Divine goodness does not always pursue the same
even course &#8212; occasionally appears to suffer an interruption, and
sometimes seems as if it were cut off altogether, David repels any temptation
which this might suggest, by asserting that, whatever appearances may say to the
contrary, it is daily exercised. This is evidently the meaning which he intends
to convey, that any partial obstructions which may take place in the display of
it can never prevent its constant renewal. He was confident that he would
experience, in the future, what he had found in the past; for God cannot become
weary in helping his people, or alleviating their miseries; and although he may
suffer them again and again to fall into affliction, he is always equally ready
to extend them the deliverance which they
need.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy tongue reckons up
mischiefs</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>David is not to be considered
as here venting a flood of reproaches against his adversary, as many who have
been unjustly injured are in the habit of doing, merely to gratify a feeling of
revenge. He brings these charges against him in the sight of God, with a view to
encourage himself in the hopefulness of his own cause: for it is plain that the
farther our enemies proceed in the practice of iniquity, they proportionally
provoke the anger of the Lord, and are nearer to that destruction which must
issue in our deliverance. His object, therefore, is not to blacken the character
of Doeg in the estimation of the world, but rather to set before his own eyes
the divine punishment which the flagrant offenses he specifies were certain to
draw down upon his head. Amongst these he singles out, as more especially worthy
of reprobation, the hidden treachery with which he had been chargeable in
accomplishing the destruction of the priesthood. Adverting to his secret and
malicious information, he likens

it is made still more evident that his object in dwelling upon the aggravated
guilt of Doeg, was to prove the certainty of his approaching doom, and this
rather for his own conviction and comfort, than with a view to alarming the
conscience of the offender. Accordingly, he declares his persuasion that God
would not allow his treachery to pass unpunished, though he might for a time
connive at the perpetration of it. The ungodly are disposed, so long as their
prosperity continues, to indulge in undisturbed security; and the saint of God,
when he sees the power of which they are possessed, and witnesses their proud
contempt of the divine judgments, is too apt to be overwhelmed with unbelieving
apprehensions. But in order to establish his mind in the truth which he
announces, it is observable that the Psalmist heaps one expression upon another,

reason why the ruin of Doeg might be expected, that an important end would be
obtained by it, in so far as it would promote religion in the hearts of the
Lord's people, and afford them a refreshing display of the Divine justice.
Should it take place, it would be witnessed by the ungodly as well as by the
righteous; but there are two reasons why the Psalmist represents it as being
seen especially by the latter. The wicked are incapable of profiting by the
judgments of God, being blind to the plainest manifestations which he has made
of himself in his works, and it was only the righteous therefore who could<i>
</i>see it. Besides, the great end which God has in view, when he prostrates the
pride of the ungodly, is the comfort of his own people, that he may show to them
the care with which he watches over their safety. It is they, therefore, whom
David represents as witnessing this spectacle of Divine justice. And when he
says that they would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>it is not meant that they would tremble, or experience any slavish
apprehension, but that their reverential regard for God would be increased by
this proof of his care of their interests. When left exposed to the injurious
treatment of their enemies, they are apt to be distressed with doubts as to the
concern which he takes in the government of the world. But such illustrations to
the contrary have the effect of quickening their discouraged zeal, and promoting
that fear which is by no means inconsistent with the joy spoken of in the close
of the verse. They are led to reverence him the more when they see that he is
the avenger of cruelty and injustice: on the other hand, when they perceive that
he appears in defense of their cause, and joins common battle with them against
their adversaries, they are naturally filled with the most triumphant joy. The
beautiful play upon the words <i>see </i>and <i>fear, </i>in the Hebrew, cannot
be transferred to our language; the form of the expression intimates that they
would see, and see effectually.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lo! this is the man that
made not God his strength</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some think
that these words are given as what should afterwards be proverbially applied to
Doeg; but they would not appear to have been intended in that restricted
signification. They merely express the improvement which the people of God would
make of the judgment. It would teach them, on the one hand, to be patient under
the insolence of the ungodly, which is so speedily humbled; and, on the other,
to beware of indulging a similarly infatuated spirit themselves. They would
laugh at their destruction, yet not in the way of insulting over them, but
rejoicing more and more in the confidence of the help of God, and denying
themselves more cheerfully to the vain pleasures of this world. This is the
lesson to be learned from such dispensations of providence: they should recall
our wandering affections to God. The verse is introduced with an exclamation,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lo! this is the
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc.; for David would have us to
look upon this one instance as representing to our eyes, in a vivid manner, the
end of all who despise the Lord; and it may be remarked, that it is no small
point of practical wisdom thus to generalise individual providences. The two
clauses, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>made not God his
strength</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>trusted in the abundance of his
riches</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>stand mutually connected; for
none can be said sincerely to repose upon God but he who has been emptied of all
confidence in his own resources. So long as men imagine that they have something
of their own in which they can boast, they will never resort to God: just in
proportion as we arrogate to ourselves do we derogate from him; and it is not
only wealth, but any other earthly possession, which, by engrossing our
confidence, may prevent us from inquiring after the Lord. The noun

resembled the withered trunk of a tree which rots upon the ground, he compares

the way of convincing him that God was the avenging judge of human cruelty, and
leading him to infer that, as he had punished his wrongs, so he would advance
him to renewed measures of prosperity. From his language, it appears that he
could conceive of no higher felicity in his condition than being admitted
amongst the number of the worshippers of God, and engaging in the exercises of
devotion. This was characteristic of his spirit. We have already had occasion to
see that he felt his banishment from the sanctuary of God more keenly than
separation from his consort, the loss of worldly substance, or the dangers and
hardships of the wilderness. The idea of an allusion being here made, by way of
contrast, to Doeg, who came to the tabernacle of the Lord merely as a spy, and
under hypocritical pretexts, is strained and far-fetched. It is more natural to
suppose that David distinguishes himself from all his enemies, without
exception, intimating that, though he was presently removed from the tabernacle,
he would soon be restored to it; and that they who boasted of possessing, or
rather monopolising, the house of God, would be rooted out of it with disgrace.
And here let us engrave the useful lesson upon our hearts, that we should
consider it the great end of our existence to be found numbered amongst the
worshippers of God; and that we should avail ourselves of the inestimable
privilege of the stated assemblies of the Church, which are necessary helps to
our infirmity, and means of mutual excitement and encouragement. By these, and
our common Sacraments, the Lord, who is one God, and who designed that we should
be one in him, is training us up together in the hope of eternal life, and in
the united celebration of his holy name. Let us learn with David to prefer a
place in the house of God to all the lying vanities of this world. He adds the
reason why he should be like the green olive-tree &#8212; because
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he hoped in the goodness of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for the causal particle appears to
be understood. And in this he adverts to the contrast between him and his
enemies. They might flourish for a time, spread their branches far and wide, and
shoot themselves up to a gigantic stature, but would speedily wither away,
because they had no root in the goodness of God; whereas he was certain to
derive from this source ever renewed supplies of sap and vigor. As the term of
his earthly trials might be protracted, and there was a danger that he might
sink under their long continuance, unless his confidence should extend itself
far into futurity, he declares expressly that he would not presume to prescribe
times to God, and that his hopes were stretched into eternity. It followed that
he surrendered himself entirely to God in all that regarded this life or his
death. The passage puts us in possession of the grand distinction between the
genuine children of God and those who are hypocrites. They are to be found
together in the Church, as the wheat is mingled with the chaff on the same
threshing-floor; but the one class abides for ever in the steadfastness of a
well-founded hope, while the other is driven away in the vanity of its false
confidences.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will praise
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc</i>. He concludes the psalm with
thanksgiving, and shows that he is sincere in this, by the special
acknowledgement which he makes of the fact that this had been the work of God.
Such is the corruption of the human heart, that out of a hundred who profess
gratitude to God with their lips, scarcely one man seriously reflects upon the
benefits which he has received as coming from his hand. David declares,
therefore, that it was entirely owing to the divine protection that he had
escaped from the treachery of Doeg, and from all his subsequent dangers, and
promises to retain a grateful sense of it throughout the whole of his life.
There is no religious duty in which it does not become us to manifest a spirit
of perseverance; but we need to be especially enjoined to it in the duty of
thanksgiving, disposed as we are so speedily to forget our mercies, and
occasionally to imagine that the gratitude of a few days is a sufficient tribute
for benefits which deserve to be kept in everlasting remembrance. He speaks of
joining the exercise of hope with that of gratitude;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for to wait on the name of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is synonymous with patiently
expecting his mercy even when there is least appearance of its being granted,
and trusting in his word, whatever delays there may be in the fulfillment of it.
He encourages himself in the belief that his hope will not be vain, by
reflecting that the name of God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is good before his
saints</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some read, <i>because it is good
before thy saints; </i>that is, to hope in the divine name,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B808&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
118:8.) But the other reading appears to me to be the most simple and natural,
expressing the truth, that God will not frustrate the expectations of his
people, because his goodness towards them is always conspicuous. The name of God
may be detested by the wicked, and the very sound of it be sufficient to strike
terror into their hearts; but David asserts it to be a sweet name in the
experience of all his people. They are here called his meek ones, because, as I
have remarked in commenting upon Psalm 16:3, they reflect in their character the
kindness and beneficence of their Father in heaven.</font><br></div>

he takes notice of the particular circumstances in which the psalm was written,
to teach us that we should never despair of divine help even in the worst
situation. Surrounded as he was by hostile troops, and hemmed in on every side
by apparently inevitable destruction, we cannot but admire the rare and heroical
intrepidity which he displayed in committing himself, by prayer, to the
Almighty. It might have appeared just as credible that God could bring the dead
out of the grave, as that he could preserve him in such circumstances; for it
seemed impossible that he should escape from the cave where he was concealed

</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Save me, O
God!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As David was at this time placed
beyond the reach of human assistance, he must be understood as praying to be
saved by the <i>name </i>and <i>the power of God, </i>In an emphatical sense, or
by these in contradistinction to the usual means of deliverance. Though all help
must ultimately come from God, there are ordinary methods by which he generally
extends it. When these fail, and every earthly stay is removed, he must then
take the work into his own hands. It was in such a situation that David here
fled to the saints' last asylum, and sought to be saved by a miracle of divine
power. By appealing, in the second part of the verse, to God as his judge, he
asserts his uprightness. And it must strike us all, that in asking the divine
protection it is indispensably prerequisite we should be convinced of the
goodness of our cause, as it would argue the greatest profanity in any to expect
that God should patronise iniquity. David was encouraged to pray for deliverance
by the goodness of his cause and his consciousness of integrity; nor did he
entertain a single doubt, that on representing this to God he would act the part
of his defender, and punish the cruelty and treachery of his
enemies.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear my prayer, O God!
</i></font><font face="Palatino">The language is expressive of his earnestness.
He was led to this fervor of supplication by the extremity of his present
circumstances, which is alluded to in the following verse, where he complains of
being surrounded by men fierce, barbarous, and unrestrained by a sense of
religion. There was no necessity for his informing God of a fact which was
already known to him; but he disburdens his own heart by venting the cause of
his fear and disquietude. By calling his enemies
<i>strangers,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb289</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he seems to refer to their
barbarity, whether he applied the name to the Ziphites only, or, in general, to
the whole army of Saul. Others consider him, in this term, to advert to their
degeneracy as children of Abraham; and it is true that the Jews are repeatedly
stigmatised by the prophets under this form of expression, when they had cast
themselves out of the Church of God by their profligacy or impiety. But in this
passage it seems to be used in a different sense. As even enemies are
accustomed, in some measure, to respect the ties of kindred and relationship,
David would point out to us the monstrous inhumanity of the men who now
surrounded him, by the fact that they assaulted him as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>strangers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>as persons who had never known him, or as if he had been born in some
distant part of the world. He calls them, also,

</i>as some have rendered the word; for that falls short of the meaning intended
by David, which was, that they were divested of all humanity, and ready to rush
upon him like wild beasts. Hence the fear with which he resorted to the
protection of God. He adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they sought after his
soul,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to denote that nothing would
content their insatiable cruelty but his life. And the better to express the
unbridled nature of their fury, he tells us that they had no respect to God. The
only thing which could be supposed, in the circumstances, to act as a restraint
upon their minds, was the consideration of there being a judge in heaven to whom
they were amenable for their conduct; and being insensible to this, what
moderation could be expected of
them?</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
54:4-7	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4</b>. Behold! God is my helper;

</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold! God is my
helper</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Such language as this may show
us that David did not direct his prayers at random into the air, but offered
them in the exercise of a lively faith. There is much force in the demonstrative
adverb. He points, as it were, with the finger, to that God who stood at his
side to defend him; and was not this an amazing illustration of the power with
which faith can surmount all obstacles, and glance, in a moment, from the depths
of despair to the very throne of God? He was a fugitive amongst the dens of the
earth, and even there in hazard of his life &#8212; how, then, could he speak of
God as being near to him? He was pressed down to the very mouth of the grave;
and how could he recognize the gracious presence of God? He was trembling in the
momentary expectation of being destroyed; and how is it possible that he can
triumph in the certain hope that Divine help will presently be extended to him?
In numbering God amongst his defenders, we must not suppose that he assigns him
a mere common rank amongst the men who supported his cause, which would have
been highly derogatory to his glory. He means that God took part with those,
such as Jonathan and others, who were interested in his welfare. These might be
few in number, possessed of little power, and cast down with fears; but he
believed that, under the guidance and protection of the Almighty, they would
prove superior to his enemies: or, perhaps, we may view him as referring, in the
words, to his complete destitution of all human defenders, and asserting that
the help of God would abundantly compensate for
all.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

Some give an optative signification to the verb, understanding the words to
express a wish or prayer; but I see no reason why it should not be taken
strictly in the future tense, and imagine that David intimates his certain
expectation that this favor, which he had already prayed for, would be granted.
It is by no means uncommon to find the prayers of the Psalmist intersected with
sentences of this kind, inserted for the purpose of stimulating his faith, as
here, where he announces the general truth, that God is the righteous judge who
will recompense the wicked. With the view of confirming his hopes, he adverts
particularly to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
truth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of God; for nothing can support us
in the hour of temptation, when the Divine deliverance may be long delayed, but
a firm persuasion that God is true, and that he cannot deceive us by his divine
promises. His confidence of obtaining his request was grounded upon the
circumstance that God could no more deny his word than deny
himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>I will freely sacrifice unto
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>According to his usual custom, he
engages, provided deliverance should be granted, to feel a grateful sense of it;
and there can be no doubt that he here promises also to return thanks to God, in
a formal manner, when he should enjoy an opportunity of doing so. Though God
principally looks to the inward sentiment of the heart, that would not excuse
the neglect of such rites as the Law had prescribed. He would testify his sense
of the favor which he received, in the manner common to all the people of God,
by sacrifices, and be thus the means of exciting others to their duty by his
example. And he would </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sacrifice
freely</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>by which he does not allude to
the circumstance, that sacrifices of thanksgiving were at the option of
worshippers, but to the alacrity and cheerfulness with which he would pay his
vow when he had escaped his present dangers. The generality of men promise
largely to God so long as they are under the present pressure of affliction, but
are no sooner relieved than they relapse into that carelessness which is natural
to them, and forget the goodness of the Lord. But David engages to sacrifice
freely, and in another manner than the hypocrite, whose religion is the
offspring of servility and constraint. We are taught by the passage that, in
coming into the presence of God, we cannot look for acceptance unless we bring
to his service a willing mind. The last clause of this verse, and the verse
which follows, evidently refer to the time when the Psalmist had obtained the
deliverance which he sought. The whole psalm, it is true, must have been written
after his deliverance; but up to this point, it is to be considered as recording
the form of prayer which he used when yet exposed to the danger. We are now to
suppose him relieved from his anxieties, and subjoining a fresh expression of
his gratitude: nor is it improbable that, he refers to mercies which he had
experienced at other periods of his history, and which were recalled to his
memory by the one more immediately brought under our notice in the preceding
verses; so that he is to be understood as declaring, in a more general sense,
that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the name of God was good,
and that he had been delivered out of all
trouble</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I have already adverted, in a
former psalm,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;195206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
52:6,) to the sense in which the righteous are said <i>to see </i>the
destruction of their enemies. It is such a sight of the event as is accompanied
with joy and comfort; and should any inquire, whether it is allowable for the
children of God to feel pleasure in witnessing the execution of Divine judgments
upon the wicked, the answer is obvious, that all must depend upon the motive by
which they are influenced. If their satisfaction proceed in any measure from the
gratification of a depraved feeling, it must be condemned; but there is
certainly a pure and unblameable delight which we may feel in looking upon such
illustrations of the divine justice.</font><br></div>

forced to take refuge under circumstances of great distress in the wilderness.
But it seems rather to have been written at a period when he was reduced to
extreme danger by the persecutions of Saul. It is a prayer, expressive of the
deepest distress, and full of fervor, urging every consideration which could be
supposed to solicit the compassion of God. After having disburdened his sorrows
and given utterance to his requests, the Psalmist contemplates the prospect of
deliverance, and offers thanksgivings to God as if he had already obtained

psalm opens, we may conclude that David at this time was laboring under heavy
distress. It could be no ordinary amount of it which produced such an
overwhelming effect upon a saint of his distinguished courage. The translation
which has been given of
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dyra</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>arid, I will prevail, </i>does violence to the context, for, so far from
boasting of the fortitude which would govern his address, he is anxious to
convey an impression of his wretchedness, by intimating that he was constrained
to cry out aloud. What is added in the third verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By reason of the voice of the
enemy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>may be viewed as connected either
with the first verse or that immediately preceding, or with both. By the
<i>voice </i>some understand such a noise as is occasioned by a multitude of
men; as if he had said, that the enemy was mustering many troops against him:
but he rather alludes to the threatenings which we may suppose that Saul was in
the habit of venting upon this innocent prophet. The interpretation, too, which
has been given of the <i>casting of iniquity </i>upon him, as if it meant that
his enemies loaded him with false accusations, is strained, and scarcely
consistent with the context. The words are designed to correspond with the
succeeding clause, where it is said that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his enemies fought against him in
wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and, therefore, <i>to cast
iniquity upon him </i>means, in my opinion, no more than to discharge their
unjust violence upon him for his destruction, or iniquitously to plot his ruin.
If any distinction be intended between the two clauses, perhaps the <i>fighting
against him in wrath </i>may refer to their open violence, and <i>the casting of
iniquity upon him</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>affliction of the

active sense of persecution. And in applying the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wicked</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>to his enemies, he does not so much level an accusation against them as
implicitly assert his own innocence. Our greatest comfort under persecution is
conscious rectitude, the reflection that we have not deserved it; for there
springs from this the hope that we will experience the help of the Lord, who is
the shield and defense of the
distressed.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

of the extremity of David's sufferings. He that uses these words was no soft or
effeminate person, but one who had given indubitable proofs of constancy. Nor is
it merely of the atrocious injuries inflicted upon him by his enemies that he
complains. He exclaims that he is overwhelmed with terrors, and thus
acknowledges that his heart was not insensible to his afflictions. We may learn
from the passage, therefore, not only that the sufferings which David endured at
this time were heavy, but that the fortitude of the greatest servants of God
fails them in the hour of severe trial. We are all good soldiers so long as
things go well with us, but when brought to close combat, our weakness is soon
apparent. Satan avails himself of the advantage, suggests that God has withdrawn
the supports of his Spirit, and instigates us to despair. Of this we have an
example in David, who is here represented as struggling with inward fears, as
well as a complication of outward calamities, and sustaining a sore conflict of
spirit in his application to the throne of God. The expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>terrors of
death</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>shows that he was on the very eve
of sinking unless Divine grace
interposed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6<i>.

merely that he could find no mode of escape. They are meant to express the
deplorableness of his situation, which made exile a blessing to be coveted, and
this not the common exile of mankind, but such as that of the dove when it flies
far off to some deserted hiding-place. They imply that he could only escape by a
miracle. They intimate that even the privilege of retreat by common banishment
was denied him, so that it fared worse with him than with the poor bird of
heaven, which can at least fly from its pursuer. Some think that the dove is
singled out on account of its swiftness. The Jews held the ridiculous idea that
the Hebrew reads
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>in the singular number, because doves use but one wing in flying; whereas
nothing is more common in Scripture than such a change of number. It seems most
probable that David meant by this comparison, that he longed to escape from his
cruel enemies, as the timid and defenseless dove flies from the hawk. Great,
indeed, must have been the straits to which he was reduced, when he could so far
forget the promise made to him of the kingdom as, in the agitation of his
spirits, to contemplate a disgraceful flight, and speak of being content to hide
himself far from his native country, and the haunts of human society, in some
solitude of the wilderness. Nay, he adds, as if by way of concession to the fury
of his adversaries, that he was willing (would they grant it) <i>to wander far
off, </i>that he was not proposing terms of truce to them which he never meant
to fulfill, merely to gain time, as those will do who entertain some secret and
distant hope of deliverance. We may surely say that these are the words of a man
driven to the borders of desperation. Such was the extremity in which he stood,
that though prepared to abandon all, he could not obtain life even upon that
condition. In such circumstances, in the anguish of this anxiety, we must not
wonder that his heart was overwhelmed with the sorrows of death. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h[ws</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>soah, </i>which I have rendered <i>raised, </i>is by some translated

were, his mind, he resumes the exercise of prayer. Had he indulged longer in the
strain of complaint, he might have given his sanction to the folly of those who
do themselves more harm than good by the excessive use of this barren species of
comfort. There will occasionally escape from the lips of a saint, when he prays,
some complaining exclamations which cannot be altogether justified, but he soon
recalls himself to the exercise of believing supplication. In the expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>divide their
tongue</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>there seems an allusion to the
judgment which fell upon the builders of Babel,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;013107&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
31:7.) He means in general to pray that God would break their criminal
confederacies, and distract their impious counsels, but evidently with an
indirect reference to that memorable proof which God gave of his power to thwart
the designs of the wicked by confounding their communication. It is thus that to
this day he weakens the enemies of the Church, and splits them into factions,
through the force of mutual animosities, rivalries, and disagreements in
opinion. For his own encouragement in prayer, the Psalmist proceeds to insist
upon the wickedness and malignity of his adversaries, this being a truth never
to be lost sight of, that just in proportion as men grow rampant in sin, may it
be anticipated that the divine judgments are about to descend upon them. From
the unbridled license prevailing amongst them, he comforts himself with the
reflection that the deliverance of God cannot be far distant; for he visits the
proud, but gives more grace to the humble. Before proceeding to pray for divine
judgments against them, he would intimate that he had full knowledge of their
evil and injurious character. Interpreters have spent an unnecessary degree of
labor in determining whether the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>city</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>here spoken of was that of Jerusalem or of Keilah, for David by this term
would appear merely to denote the open and public prevalence of crime in the
country. The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>city</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>stands opposed to places more hidden and obscure, and he insinuates that
strife was practiced with unblushing publicity. Granting that the city meant was
the metropolis of the kingdom, this is no reason why we should not suppose that
the Psalmist had in his view the general state of the country; but the term is,
in my opinion, evidently employed in an indefinite sense, to intimate that such
wickedness as is generally committed in secret was at that time openly and
publicly perpetrated. It is with the same view of marking the aggravated
character of the wickedness then reigning in the nation, that he describes their
crimes as going about the walls, keeping sentry or watch, so to speak, upon
them. Walls are supposed to protect a city from rapine and incursion, but he
complains that this order of things was inverted &#8212; that the city, instead
of being surrounded with fortifications, was beset with strife and oppression,
or that these had possession of the walls, and went about
them.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

true source of the prevailing crimes; even as it was to be expected that those
who were inwardly corrupt, and given to such mischievous devices, would indulge
in violence, and in persecuting the poor and defenseless. In general, he is to
be considered as adverting in this passage to the deplorable confusions which
marked the government of Saul, when justice and order were in a manner banished
from the realm. And whether his description were intended to apply to one city
or to many, matters had surely reached a portentous crisis in a nation
professing the true religion, when any of their cities had thus become a den of
robbers. It may be observed, too, that David, in denouncing a curse, as he does
in the psalm before us, upon cities of this description, was obviously borne out
by what must have been the judgment of the Holy Spirit against
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

informs us of one circumstance which added bitterness to the injuries under
which he suffered, that they came from the hands not only of his professed
enemies, but of such as pretended to be his friends. Those mistake the meaning

borne </i>the reproach of an open enemy. What he says is, that had an open enemy
reproached him, he could then have <i>met it, </i>as one meets and parries off a
blow which is aimed at him. Against a known foe we are on our watch, but the
unsuspected stroke of a friend takes us by surprise. By adopting this view of
the word, we shall find that the repetition in the verse is more perfect;
reading in the one member, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I</i>
<i>would have met it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and in the other,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I would have hidden
myself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>When he speaks of the enemy
<i>magnifying himself against him, </i>he does not simply mean that he used
insulting language, but in general, that he summoned all his violence to
overthrow him. The sum of David's complaint in this passage is, that he was
assailed by treachery of that secret description which rendered self-defense
impossible. With regard to the individual whom he had particularly in view, when
he preferred this accusation, I do not imagine that it was Ahitophel, for the
psalm itself would not appear to have been written upon the persecution of
Absalom. Whether it may have been some notorious traitor in the city of Keilah,
it is impossible to determine. Not the least probable conjecture is, that it may
have been some great man at court, whose intimacy with David was generally
known. Possibly he may have had more than one in his eye, courtiers who had
sacrificed former friendship to a desire of rising in the royal favor, and lent
their influence to destroy him. These, with some more eminent person at their
head, may be the parties aimed at. At any rate, we are taught by the experience
of David, as here represented to us, that we must expect in this world to meet
with the secret treachery of friends, as well as with undisguised persecution.
Satan has assaulted the Church with sword and open war, but he has also raised
up domestic enemies to injure it with the more secret weapons of stratagem and
fraud. This is a species of foe which, as Bernard expresses it, we can neither
fly from nor put to flight. Whoever might be the individual referred to, David
calls him a man of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his own

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#176;r[</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>

the common bond of fraternity, as none needs to be told that there are various
bonds, whether of relationship, profession, or office, which ought to be
respected and held sacred. He makes mention also of his having been his
<i>leader </i>and commander, of their having enjoyed sweet interchange of secret
counsel together, and of their having frequented the religious assemblies in
company, &#8212; all of which he adverts to as circumstances which lent an
additional aggravation to his treachery. The term

the house of God. Thus he would inform us, that he was betrayed by one who had
been his intimate associate, and to whom he had looked up as a leader, in
matters not only secular but religious. We are taught by the Spirit to reverence
all the natural ties which bind us together in society. Besides the common and
universal one of humanity, there are others of a more sacred kind, by which we
should feel ourselves attached to men in proportion as they are more nearly
connected with us than others by neighborhood, relationship, or professional
calling, the more as we know that such connections are not the result of chance,
but of providential design and arrangement. Need I say that the bond of
religious fellowship is the most sacred of
all?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15<i>.</i>

</i></font><font face="Palatino">He now denounces the whole faction, not the
nation generally, but those who had taken a prominent part in the persecution of
him. In imprecating this curse he was not influenced by any bad feeling towards
them, and must be understood as speaking not in his own cause but in that of
God, and under the immediate guidance of his Spirit. This was no wish uttered in
a moment of resentment or of reckless and ill-considered zeal, and which would
justify us in launching maledictions against our enemies upon every trivial
provocation. The spirit of revenge differs widely from the holy and regulated
fervor with which David prays for the judgment of God against wicked men, who
had already been doomed to everlasting destruction. The translation,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let death condemn
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is<i> </i>forced, and so also is
another which has been suggested, <i>Let him appoint death a creditor over
them.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb311</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>That which we have given is the
most obvious and simple. In praying that his enemies may <i>descend alive into
the grave, </i>it has been well observed, that he seems to allude to the
punishment of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; though I conceive that in imprecating
sudden and unexpected ruin upon them, he adverts to the proud persuasion which
they cherished in their prosperity, that they would escape the stroke of death.
"Lord," as if he had said, "in the infatuation of their pride they consider
themselves to be exempted from the ordinary lot of mortality, but let the earth
swallow them up alive &#8212; let nothing prevent their being dragged down with
all their pomp to the destruction which they deserve." The cause which he
assigns for his prayer in the latter part of the verse, is another proof that he
was not influenced by any personal resentment against his enemies, but simply
denounced the just judgments of God upon such as persecuted the Church.

cherished their wickedness, so that it was their inseparable companion, and

retained the future tense of the verb, as the Psalmist does not refer to
something already done, but rather excites himself to the duty of prayer, and to
the exercise of hope and confidence. Though there was no apparent method of
escape, and he stood on the brink of immediate destruction, he declares his
resolution to continue in prayer, and expresses his assurance that it would be
successful. In the verse which follows he engages more particularly to show
perseverance in prayer. He does not content himself with saying that he will
pray, for many do this in a perfunctory manner, and soon become wearied with the
exercise; but he resolves to display both assiduity and vehemency. From the
particular mention he makes of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>evening, morning,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>noon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>we are left to infer that these must have been the stated hours of prayer
amongst the godly at that period. Sacrifices were offered daily in the temple
morning and evening, and by this they were taught to engage privately in prayer
within their own houses. At noon also it was the practice to offer additional
sacrifices. As we are naturally indisposed for the duty of prayer, there is a
danger that we may become remiss, and gradually omit it altogether, unless we
restrict ourselves to a certain rule. In appointing particular fixed hours to be
observed for his worship, there can be no doubt that God had respect to the
infirmity of our nature, and the same principle should be applied to the secret
as to the public services of devotion, as appears from the passage now before
us, and from the example of Daniel,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;270903&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
9:3.) Sacrifices are no longer to be observed in the Church, but as there
remains the same indisposition on our part to the duty, and an equal need of
incitements to overcome it, we should still prescribe certain hours to ourselves
to be observed in prayer. He adds, that he would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cry
aloud</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>to denote vehemency of
supplication, under the grief and anxiety of mind to which he was subjected. He
intimates, that no extremity of present trouble would prevent him from directing
his complaint to God, and cherishing a confident hope of
deliverance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18<i>.</i>
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He hath redeemed my soul into
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Those who read the two preceding
verses in the perfect instead of the future tense, are apparently led to this by
considering that David here proves his former prayers to have been answered,
from the fact of deliverance having been granted. But there is no difficulty
involved in adopting the other reading. We may suppose that either he was so
confident of being delivered that he speaks as if he actually were so already,
or that he inserts what was the substance of his meditations at different times;
it being sufficiently common, when mention is made of prayers, to subjoin a
statement of the event which followed from them. Having spoken, then, of his
prayers, he adverts to the result of them, with the view of expressing his
thankfulness for the mercy which he had received. He says that he had been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>redeemed into peace
</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>&#8212; </i>a<i> </i>strong expression,
signifying the danger to which he had been exposed, and the almost miraculous
manner in which he had been delivered from it. What is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they were in great numbers with
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>admits of a double meaning. Some
understand him as referring to enemies;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with

to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>against

beset, by a host of adversaries, and commends the goodness manifested by God in
accomplishing his deliverance. Others think that he refers to the angels, whose
hosts are encamped round about those that fear the Lord,

that he would answer him, in the way of avenging his cause, in the punishment of
his enemies. The epithet, or descriptive title, which he applies to God, is one
calculated to comfort the pious mind in times of trouble and confusion. Much of
that impatience into which we are hurried arises from not elevating our thoughts
to the eternity of God. Can anything be more unreasonable than that poor
mortals, who pass away like a shadow, should measure God by their feeble
apprehensions, which is to cast him down from his eternal throne, and subject
him to the fluctuations of a changing world? As

here complains of the destruction of the wicked having been too long deferred;
but this is not a probable interpretation. The term has been more properly
rendered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>changes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.

change to the better was to be expected in their character; that they were so

Others, with more reason, consider that he refers, in the language of complaint,
to the uninterrupted flow of their prosperity, which was such that they seemed
exempt from the common vicissitudes of life. He represents them as being
corrupted by this indulgence, and casting off from their minds every principle
of fear, as if they were privileged with immunity from mortal ills. The
copulative particle will thus carry the force of a consequence &#8212;

the longer the wicked are left in the enjoyment of their pleasures, they are
only hardened the more in their evil courses; and that where pride has the
ascendancy in the heart, the effect of the Divine indulgence is to make us
forget that we are men. In the connection between the two parts of the verse
there is an implied censure of the infatuation of those who are led by their
exemption from adversity to conclude that. they are a species of demigods; for,
how insignificant is the course of human life when compared with the eternity of
God? We have need to be upon our guard when under prosperity, lest we fall into
the secure spirit which the Psalmist here alludes to, and even carry our
exultation to the extent of a defiance of the

announced in an open manner his intention to give battle, but had commenced the
attack unexpectedly and with treachery. The same charge is insisted upon still
further, when it is added, that butter and oil were in his lips, while war was

might justify us in supposing that the noun deduced from it can mean <i>a

express is a pious one, that we ought to disburden ourselves before God of all
the cares and troubles which oppress us. There is no other method of relieving
our anxious souls, but by reposing ourselves upon the providence of the Lord. At
the same time, I find no example of such a translation of the word, and adhere
therefore to the other, which conveys sufficiently important instruction,
provided we understand the expression
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gift</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>giving</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>in a passive sense, as meaning all the benefits which we desire God to give
us. The exhortation is to the effect that we should resign into the hands of God
the care of those things which may concern our advantage. It is not enough that
we make application to God for the supply of our wants. Our desires and
petitions must be offered up with a due reliance upon his providence, for how
many are there who pray in a clamorous spirit, and who, by the inordinate
anxiety and restlessness which they evince, seem resolved to dictate terms to
the Almighty. In opposition to this, David recommends it as a due part of
modesty in our supplications, that we should transfer to God the care of those
things which we ask, and there can be no question that the only means of
checking an excessive impatience is an absolute submission to the Divine will,
as to the blessings which should be bestowed. Some would explain the passage:
Acknowledge the past goodness of the Lord to have been such, that you ought to
hope in his kindness for the future. But this does not give the genuine meaning
of the words. As to whether David must be considered as here exhorting himself
or others, it is a question of little moment, though he seems evidently, in
laying down a rule for his own conduct, to prescribe one at the same time to all
the children of God. The words which he subjoins,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he shall feed
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>clearly confirm that view of the
passage which I have given above. Subject as we are in this life to manifold
wants, we too often yield ourselves up to disquietude and anxiety. But David
assures us that God will sustain to us the part of a shepherd, assuming the
entire care of our necessities, and supplying us with all that is really for our
advantage. He adds, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he will
not suffer the righteous to fall, or always to
stagger</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>If
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">fwm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mot, </i>be understood as meaning
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a
fall</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>then the sense will run: God shall
establish the righteous that he shall never fall. But the other rendering seems
preferable. We see that the righteous for a time are left to stagger, and almost
to sink under the storms by which they are beset. From this distressing state
David here declares, that they shall be eventually freed, and blessed with a
peaceful termination of all their harassing dangers and
cares.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23<i>.</i>
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou, O God! shalt cast them
into the pit of corruption.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He returns
to speak of his enemies, designing to show the very different end which awaits
them, from that which may be expected by the righteous. The only reflection
which comforts the latter, when cast down at the feet of their oppressors, is,
that they can confidently look for a peaceful issue to the dangers which
encompass them; while, on the other hand, they can discern by faith the certain
destruction which impends the wicked. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tj&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shachath, </i>signifies <i>the grave, </i>and as there seems an impropriety
in saying that they are cast into the <i>pit of the grave, </i>some read in

shachath, to corrupt, </i>or <i>destroy. </i>It is a matter of little
consequence which signification be adopted; one thing is obvious, that David
means to assert that they would be overtaken not only by a temporary, but
everlasting destruction. And here he points at a distinction between them and
the righteous. These may sink into many a deep pit of worldly calamity, but they
arise again. The ruin which awaits their enemies is here declared to be deadly,
as God will cast them into the grave, that they may rot there. In calling them

men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb324</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he adverts to a reason which
confirmed the assertion he had made. The vengeance of God is certain to overtake
the cruel and the deceitful; and this being the character of his adversaries, he
infers that their punishment would be inevitable. "But does it consist," may
some ask, "with what passes under our observation, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bloody men live not half their
days?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>If the character apply to any, it
must with peculiar force to tyrants, who consign their fellow-creatures to
slaughter, for the mere gratification of their licentious passions. To such very
evidently, and not to common murderers, does the Psalmist refer in this place;
and yet will not tyrants, who have butchered their hundreds of thousands, reach
frequently an advanced period of life?" They may; but notwithstanding instances
of this description, where God has postponed the execution of judgment, the
assertion of the Psalmist is borne out by many considerations. With regard to
temporal judgments, it is enough that we see them executed upon the wicked, in
the generality of cases, for a strict or perfect distribution in this matter is
not to be expected, as I have shown at large upon the thirty-seventh psalm. Then
the life of the wicked, however long it may be protracted, is agitated by so
many fears and disquietudes, that it scarcely merits the name, and may be said
to be death rather than life. Nay, that life is worse than death which is spent
under the curse of God, and under the accusations of a conscience which torments
its victim more than the most barbarous executioner. Indeed, if we take a right
estimate of what the course of this life is, none can be said to have reached
its goal, but such as have lived and died in the Lord, for to them, and them
alone, death as well as life is gain. When assailed, therefore, by the violence
or fraud of the wicked, it may comfort us to know that their career shall be
short, &#8212; that they shall be driven away, as by a whirlwind, and their
schemes, which seemed to meditate the destruction of the whole world, dissipated
in a moment. The short clause which is subjoined, and which closes the psalm,
suggests that this judgment of the wicked must be waked for in the exercise of
faith and patience, for the Psalmist rests in hope for his deliverance. From
this it appears that the wicked are not cut off so suddenly from the earth, as
not to afford us hope for the exhibition of patience under the severity of
long-continued injuries.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
56</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In this psalm David mixes complaint with prayer, and
assuages the distress of his mind by meditation upon the mercy of God. He pray,
that he may experience the divine help under the persecutions to which he was
subjected by Saul, and his other enemies; and expresses his confidence of
success. It is possible, however, that the psalm may have been written after the
dangers to which he alludes were past, and in thanksgiving for a deliverance
which he had already received.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The portion of history referred to in the title is
recorded in 1 Samuel 21. Being driven from every hiding-place in which he had
hitherto found safety, he fled to King Achish. He speaks here of having been
apprehended; and that he was so, may be gathered from the inspired narrative,
where Achish is represented as saying, "Lo, ye see the man is mad; wherefore,
then, have ye brought him to me?" It is probable that they suspected him of some
sinister design in the visit. He escaped upon that occasion by feigning madness;
but this psalm proves that he must have been engaged in fervent supplication,
and that faith was secretly in exercise even when he betrayed this weakness. He
would not appear to have been under that inordinate agitation of mind, which
instigates men to adopt methods of relief which are positively sinful; but in
the desperate emergency to which he was reduced, he was compelled through fear
to employ an artful device, which might save his life, although it would lower
his dignity in the eyes of the world. If he lost the praise of magnanimity, it
is at least apparent from this psalm, what a strenuous contest there was between
faith and fear in his heart. The words, <i>upon the silent dove, </i>are
supposed by some to have formed the commencement of a song well known at the
time. Others have thought that David is here compared to a dove; and this
conjecture is borne out by the propriety of the metaphor in his present
circumstances,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb326</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> especially as it is added, <i>in

determine whether he speaks here of foreign or domestic enemies. When brought to
King Achish he was as a sheep between two bands of wolves, an object of deadly
hatred to the Philistines on the one hand, and exposed to equal persecutions
from his own fellow-countrymen. He uses the indefinite term <i>man </i>in this
verse, though in the next he speaks of having many enemies, the more forcibly to
express the truth that the whole world was combined against him, that he
experienced no humanity amongst men, and stood in the last necessity of divine
help. The term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>daily</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

in general, he deplores the wretchedness of his fate in being beset with
adversaries so numerous and so barbarous. Some translate
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&atilde;a&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,

found, however, in the sense </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
fight against</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and I was unwilling to
depart from the received rendering. I shall only observe in passing, that those
who read in the second member of the verse, <i>many fighting with me, </i>as if
he alluded to the assistance of angels, mistake the meaning of the passage; for
it is evident that he uses the language of complaint throughout the
verse.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>In the day that I was afraid,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
etc. </i>In the Hebrew, the words run in the future tense, but they must be
resolved into the praeterite. He acknowledges his weakness, in so far as he was
sensible of fear, but denies having yielded to it. Dangers might distress him,
but could not induce him to surrender his hope. He makes no pretensions to that
lofty heroism which contemns danger, and yet while he allows that he felt fear,
he declares his fixed resolution to persist in a confident expectation of the
divine favor. The true proof of faith consists in this, that when we feel the
solicitations of natural fear, we can resist them, and prevent them from
obtaining an undue ascendancy. Fear and hope may seem opposite and incompatible
affections, yet it is proved by observation, that the latter never comes into
full sway unless there exists some measure of the former. In a tranquil state of
the mind, there is no scope for the exercise of hope. At such times it lies
dormant, and its power is only displayed to advantage when we see it elevating
the soul under dejection, calming its agitations, or soothing its distractions.
This was the manner in which it manifested itself in David, who feared, and yet
trusted, was sensible of the greatness of his danger, and yet quieted his mind
with the confident hope of the divine
deliverance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In God I will praise his
word</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here he grows more courageous in
the exercise of hope, as generally happens with the people of God. They find it
difficult at first to reach this exercise. It is only after a severe struggle
that they rise to it, but the effort being once made, they emerge from their
fears into the fullness of confidence, and are prepared to grapple with the most
formidable enemies. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To
praise</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is here synonymous with glorying
or boasting. He was now in possession of a triumphant confidence, and rejoiced
in the certainty of hope. The ground of his joy is said to be <i>the divine
word; </i>and this implies, that however much he might seem to be forsaken and
abandoned by God, he satisfied himself by reflecting on the truthfulness of his
promises. He would glory in God notwithstanding, and although there should be no
outward appearance of help, or it should even be sensibly withdrawn, he would
rest contented with the simple security of his word. The declaration is one that
deserves our notice. How prone are we to fret and to murmur when it has not
pleased God immediately to grant us our requests! Our discontent may not be
openly expressed, but it is inwardly felt, when we are left in this manner to
depend upon his naked promises. It was no small attainment in David, that he
could thus proceed to praise the Lord, in the midst of dangers, and with no
other ground of support but the word of God. The sentiment contained in the
latter clause of the verse might seem at first glance to merit little
consideration. What more obvious than that God is able to protect us from the
hand of men, that his power to defend is immensely greater than their power to
injure? This may be true, but we all know too well how much of that perverse
unbelief there is in our hearts, which leads us to rate the ability of God below
that of the creature. It was no small proof, therefore, of the faith of David,
that he could despise the threatenings of his enemies. And it would be well if
all the saints of God were impressed with such a sense of his superiority to
their adversaries as would lead them to show a similar contempt of danger. When
assailed by these, it should never escape their recollection, that the contest
is in reality between their enemies and God, and that it were blasphemous in
this case to doubt the issue. The great object which these have in view is to
shake our faith in the promised help of the Lord; and we are chargeable with
limiting his power, unless we realize him standing at our right hand, able with
one movement of his finger, or one breath of his mouth, to dissipate their
hosts, and confound their infatuated machinations. Shall we place him on a level
with mortal man, and measure his probable success by the numbers which are set
against him? "But how," may it be asked, "are we to account for this sudden
change in the exercise of David? A moment before, he was expressing his dread of
destruction, and now he bids defiance to the collected strength of his enemies."
I reply, that there is nothing in his words which insinuate that he was
absolutely raised above the influence of fear, and every sense of the dangers by
which he was encompassed. They imply no more than that he triumphed over his
apprehensions, through that confident hope of salvation with which he was armed.
Men he terms in this verse
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

contest so infinitely above their

cause me grief on account of my words. </i>Again,

fb333</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, <i>atsab, </i>commonly signifies to
<i>afflict with grief, </i>and in <i>Pihel </i>is always taken transitively; nor
does there seem any reason in this place to depart from the general rule of the
language. And the passage flows more naturally when rendered, <i>my words affect
me with grief, </i>or <i>vex me, </i>than by supposing that he refers to his
enemies. According to this translation, the verse contains a double complaint,
that, on the one hand, he was himself unsuccessful in everything which he
attempted, his plans having still issued in vexatious failure; while, on the
other hand, his enemies were devising every means for his destruction. It may
appear at first sight rather inconsistent to suppose that he should immediately
before have disclaimed being under the influence of fear, and now acknowledge
that he was not only distressed, but in some measure the author of his own
discomfort. I have already observed, however, that he is not to be considered as
having been absolutely divested of anxiety and fear, although enabled to look
down with contempt upon his enemies from the eminence of faith. Here he speaks
of the circumstances which tried him, which his faith certainly overcame, but at
the same time could not altogether remove out of the way. He confesses his own
lack of wisdom and foresight, shown in the abortive issue of every plan which he
devised. It aggravated the evil, that his enemies were employing their united
counsels to plot his ruin. He adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they gathered themselves
together;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and this made his case the
more calamitous, matched as he was, a single individual, against this numerous
host. In mentioning that they</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
hide themselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he adverts to the
subtile devices which they framed for surprising him into destruction. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wnypxy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>yitsponu, </i>by grammatical rule ought to have the letter

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">y</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>yod, </i>is as it were the mark of <i>Hiphil</i>,<i> </i>denoting that the
enemies of David came to the determination of employing an ambush, with the view
of surrounding him. He tells us that they pressed upon him in every direction,
and as it were trod upon his heels, so that he had no respite. And he points at
their implacable hatred as the cause of their eager pursuit of him; for nothing,
he informs us, would satisfy them but his
death.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>After their mischief they
think to escape. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The beginning of this verse is
read by some interrogatively, <i>Shall they escape in their
iniquity?</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb334</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>But there is no necessity for
having recourse to this distant meaning. It is much better to understand the
words in the sense which they naturally suggest when first read, That the wicked
think to escape in their iniquity, but that God will cast them down. He alludes
to the fact that the ungodly, when allowed to proceed without interruption in
their evil courses, indulge the idea that they have a license to perpetrate the
worst wickedness with impunity. In these our own times, we see many such profane
characters, who display an unmeasured audacity under the assurance that God's
hand can never reach them. They not only look to go unpunished, but found their
hopes of success upon their evil deeds, and encourage themselves to farther
wickedness, by cherishing the opinion that they will contrive a way of escape
from every adversity. David has no sooner stated this vain confident persuasion
of the wicked, than he refutes it by an appeal to the judgment of God, declaring
his conviction that, however proudly they might exalt themselves, the hour of
vengeance would come when God would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cast down the
peoples</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He makes use of the plural
number, to fortify his mind against fear, when he reflected upon the array of
his enemies. Let us remember, when our enemies are many, that it is one of the
prerogatives of God to cast down the people, and not one nation of foes merely,
but the world.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast taken account
of my wanderings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The words run in the
form of an abrupt prayer. Having begun by requesting God to consider his tears,
suddenly, as if he had obtained what he asked, he declares that they were
written in God's book. It is possible, indeed, to understand the interrogation
as a prayer; but he would seem rather to insinuate by this form of expression,
that he stood in no need of multiplying words, and that God had already
anticipated his desire. It is necessary, however, to consider the words of the
verse more particularly. He speaks of his <i>wandering </i>as having been noted
by God, and this that he may call attention to one remarkable feature of his
history, his having been forced to roam a solitary exile for so long a period.
The reference is not to any one wandering; the singular number is used for the
plural, or rather, he is to be understood as declaring emphatically that his
whole life was only one continued wandering. This he urges as an argument to
commiseration, spent as his years had been in the anxieties and dangers of such
a perplexing pilgrimage. Accordingly, he prays that God might
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>put his tears into his
bottle</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb335</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It was usual to preserve the
wine and oil in bottles: so that the words amount to a request that God would
not suffer his tears to fall to the ground, but keep them with care as a
precious deposit. The prayers of David, as appears from the passage before us,
proceeded upon faith in the providence of God, who watches our every step, and
by whom (to use an expression of Christ)</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Unless persuaded in our mind that God takes special
notice of each affliction which we endure, it is impossible we can ever attain
such confidence as to pray that God would put our tears into his bottle, with a
view to regarding them, and being induced by them to interpose in our behalf. He
immediately adds, that he had obtained what he asked: for, as already observed,
I prefer understanding the latter clause affirmatively. He animates his hope by
the consideration that all his tears were written in the book of God, and would
therefore be certainly remembered. And we may surely believe, that if God
bestows such honor upon the tears of his saints, he must number every drop of
their blood which is shed. Tyrants may burn their flesh and their bones, but the
blood remains to cry aloud for vengeance; and intervening ages can never erase
what has been written in the register of God's
remembrance.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When I cry, then shall
mine enemies turn back.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here he boasts
of victory with even more confidence than formerly, specifying, as it were, the
very moment of time when his enemies were to be turned back. He had no sensible
evidence of their approaching destruction but from the firm reliance which he
exercised upon the promise, he was able to anticipate the coming period, and
resolved to wait for it with patience. Though God might make no haste to
interpose, and might not scatter his enemies at the very instant when he prayed,
he was confident that his prayers would not be disappointed: and his ground for
believing this was just a conviction of the truth, that God never frustrates the
prayers of his own children. With this conviction thoroughly fixed in his mind,
he could moderate his anxieties, and calmly await the issue. It is instructive
to notice, that David, when he would secure the obtainment of his request, does
not pray in a hesitating or uncertain spirit, but with a confident assurance of
his being heard. Having once reached this faith, he sets at defiance the devil
and all the host of the
ungodly.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>.
</i></b><i>In God will I praise his word</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>In the original the pronoun is not expressed, but we are left to infer, from
the parallel verse which went before, that it is understood. The repetition adds
an emphasis to the sentiment, intimating, that though God delayed the sensible
manifestation of his favor, and might seem to deal hardly in abandoning him to
the word &#8212; giving him nothing more, he was resolved to glory in it with
undiminished confidence. When in a spirit such as this we honor the word of God,
though deprived of any present experience of his goodness or his power, we "set
to our seal that God is true,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430333&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
3:33.) The repetition amounts to an expression of his determination that,
notwithstanding all circumstances which might appear to contravene the promise,
he would trust in it, and persist in praising it both now, henceforth, and for
ever. How desirable is it that the Lord's people generally would accustom
themselves to think in the same manner, and find, in the word of God, matter of
never-failing praise amidst their worst trials! They may meet with many mercies
calling for the exercise of thanksgiving, but can scarcely have proceeded one
step in life before they will feel the necessity of reliance upon the naked
promise. A similar reason may be given for his repetition of the sentiment in
the 11th verse &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In God
have I hoped</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. We shall find men
universally agreed in the opinion that God is an all-sufficient protector; but
observation proves how ready we are to distrust him under the slightest
temptation. When exposed to the opposition of assailants formidable for
strength, or policy, or any worldly advantages, let us learn with David to set
God in opposition to them, and we shall speedily be able to view the mightiest
of them without dismay.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
56:12-13	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12</b>. Thy vows are upon me, O
God! I will pay thy praises. <b>13</b>. For thou hast delivered my soul from
death: hast thou not delivered my feet from falling headlong? that I may walk

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy vows are upon me, O
God!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I hinted, from the outset, that it
is probable this psalm was written by David after he had escaped the dangers
which he describes; and this may account for the thanksgiving here appended to
it. At the same time, we have evidence that he was ever ready to engage in this
exercise even when presently suffering under his afflictions. He declares that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the vows of God were upon
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>by which he means, that he was
bound to pay them, as, among the Romans, a person who had obtained what he
sought, under engagement of a vow, was said to be <i>voti damnatus &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>condemned of his
vow</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>If we have promised thanks, and our
prayers have been heard, an obligation is contracted. He calls them the vows of
<i>God &#8212; </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thy
vows</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for the money in my hand may be
said to be my creditor's, being, as I am, in his debt. He views his deliverance
as having come from God; and the condition having been performed, he
acknowledges himself to be burdened with the vows which he had contracted. We
learn from the second part of the verse what was the nature of the vows to which
he adverts, and, by attending to this, may preserve ourselves from the mistake
of imagining that he sanctions any such vows as those which are practiced among
Papists. He says that he would render
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>praises</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>or <i>sacrifices of praise; </i>for the word is applied to sacrifices, which
were the outward symbols of thanksgiving. David knew well that God attached no
value to sacrifices considered in themselves, or irrespectively of the design
and spirit of the person offering them; but we may believe that he would not
neglect the sacred ceremonies of the Law which was imposed upon the Church at
that time; and that he speaks of some solemn expression of gratitude, such as
was customary among the Jews upon the reception of a signal Divine
favor.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thou hast delivered my
soul from death</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This confirms the truth
of the remark which I have already made, that he considered his life as received
from the hands of God, his destruction having been inevitable but for the
miraculous preservation which he had experienced. To remove all doubt upon that
subject, he speaks of having been preserved, not simply from the treachery, the
malice, or the violence of his enemies, but from death itself. And the other
form of expression which he employs conveys the same meaning, when he adds, that
God had kept him back with his hand when he was on the eve of rushing headlong
into destruction. Some translate
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yjdm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>middechi, from falling; </i>but the word denotes here a violent impulse.
Contemplating the greatness of his danger, he considers his escape as nothing
less than miraculous. It is our duty, when rescued from any peril, to retain in
our recollection the circumstances of it, and all which rendered it peculiarly
formidable. During the time that we are exposed to it, we are apt to err through
an excessive apprehension; but when it is over, we too readily forget both our
fears and the Divine goodness manifested in our deliverance.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To walk in the light of the
living</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>means nothing else than to enjoy
the vital light of the sun. The words, <i>before God, </i>which are interjected
in the verse, point to the difference between the righteous, who make God the
great aim of their life, and the wicked, who wander from the right path and turn
their back upon God.</font><br></div>

57</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This psalm consists of two parts. In the first, David
gives expression to the anxiety which he felt, imploring Divine assistance
against Saul and his other enemies. In the second, he proceeds upon the
confident expectation of deliverance, and stirs up his soul to the exercise of
praise.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">We are left entirely to conjecture as to the meaning
of the word <i>Michtam; </i>and equal uncertainty prevails among interpreters
regarding the reason of the inscription given to the psalm, <i>Al-tascheth,
i.e., destroy not. </i>Some are of opinion that this formed the commencement of
a song well known at the time; others take it to be an expression uttered by
David in the desperate exigency to which he was reduced,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O</i> <i>God! destroy me
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Others conceive that the word is
inscribed upon the psalm in praise of the high principle shown by David when he
prevented Abishai from slaying Saul, and are confirmed in their opinion by the
fact, that this is the very expression which the inspired historian represents
him as having used,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;092609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 26:9.) But as the prayers which follow must have been offered up before
he gave any such injunction to Abishai, this explanation is not satisfactory;
and we are left to adopt one or other of the two former suppositions, either
that the psalm was composed to the air of some song generally known at the time,
or that the word expresses a brief prayer, which David notes down as having been
uttered in memorable circumstances, and in circumstances of great
danger.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be merciful unto me, O
God!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The repetition of the prayer proves
that the grief, the anxiety, and the apprehension, with which David was filled
at this time, must have been of no common description. It is noticeable, that
his plea for mercy is, his having hoped in God. His
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>soul</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>trusted in him; and this is a form of expression the force of which is not
to be overlooked: for it implies that the trust which he exercised proceeded
from his very innermost affections, &#8212; that it was of no volatile
character, but deeply and strongly rooted. He declares the same truth in
figurative terms, when he adds his persuasion that God would cover him with the
shadow of his wings. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hsj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chasah, </i>which I have translated
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
hope</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>signifies occasionally <i>to
lodge, </i>or <i>obtain shelter, </i>and in this sense it may be understood with
great propriety in the passage before us, where allusion is made to the shadow
of wings. David had committed himself, in short, entirely to the guardianship of
God; and now experienced that blessed consciousness of dwelling in a place of
safety, which he expresses in the beginning of the ninetieth psalm. The divine
protection is compared to the shadow of wings, because God, as I have elsewhere
observed, the more familiarly to invite us to himself, is represented as
stretching out his wings like the hen, or other birds, for the shelter of their
young. The greater our ingratitude and perversity, in being so slow to comply
with such an endearing and gentle invitation! He does not merely say, in
general, that he would hope in God, and rest under the shadow of his wings, but,
particularly, that he would do so at the time when wickedness should pass over
him, like a storm or whirlwind. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hwh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>hovah, </i>which I have rendered <i>wickedness, </i>some translate <i>power.
</i>Be that as it may, it is evident he declares that God would prove his
refuge, and the wings of God his shelter, under every tempest of affliction
which blew over him. There are seasons when we are privileged to enjoy the calm
sunshine of prosperity; but there is not a day of our lives in which we may not
suddenly be overtaken by storms of affliction, and it is necessary we should be
persuaded that God will cover us with his wings. To hope he adds prayer. Those,
indeed, who have placed their trust in God, will always direct their prayers to
him; and David gives here a practical proof of his hope, by showing that he
applied to God in his emergencies. In addressing God, he applies to him an
honorable title, commending him as the God who performed whatsoever he had
promised, or (as we may understand the expression) who carries forward to
perfection the work which he has
begun.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb340</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rmg</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D808&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
138:8, the scope of both passages being the same. It materially confirms and
sustains our hope to reflect that God will never forsake the workmanship of his
own hands, &#8212; that he will perfect the salvation of his people, and
continue his divine guidance until he have brought them to the termination of
their course. Some read, <i>to God, who rewards me; </i>but this fails to bring
out the force of the expression. It would be more to the purpose, in my
judgment, to read, <i>God, who fails me; </i>in which case the sentence would,
of course, require to be understood adversatively: That though God failed him,
and stretched not out his hand for his deliverance, he would still persist in
crying to him. The other meaning, which some have suggested,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will cry to God, who
performs,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> or exerts to the utmost, his
severity against me, </i>is evidently forced, and the context would lead us to
understand the word as referring to the goodness of God, the constancy of which
in perfecting his work when once begun, should ever be present to our
remembrance,</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He shall send from
heaven, and save me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David, as I have
repeatedly had occasion to observe, interlaces his prayers with holy meditations
for the comfort of his own soul, in which he contemplates his hopes as already
realised in the event. In the words before us, he glories in the divine help
with as much assurance as if he had already seen the hand of God interposed in
his behalf. When it is said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he
shall send from heaven,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>some consider
the expression as elliptical, meaning that he would send <i>his angels; </i>but
it seems rather to be an indefinite form of speech, signifying that the
deliverance which David expected was one not of a common, but a signal and
miraculous description. The expression denotes the greatness of the
interposition which he looked for, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is opposed to earthly or natural means of deliverance. What follows admits
of being rendered in two different ways. We may supply the Hebrew preposition
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mem, </i>and read, <i>He shall save me from the reproach; </i>or it might be
better to understand the words appositively, <i>He shall save me, to the
reproach of him who swallows me
up.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb341</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The latter expression might be
rendered, <i>from him who waits for me. </i>His enemies gaped upon him in their
eagerness to accomplish his destruction, and insidiously watched their
opportunity; but God would deliver him, to their disgrace. He is said to strike
his enemies with shame and reproach, when he disappoints their expectations. The
deliverance which David anticipated was signal and miraculous; and he adds, that
he looked for it entirely from the mercy and truth of God, which he represents
here as the hands, so to speak, by which his assistance is extended to his
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

of his enemies as a plea to prevail with God for his speedier interposition. He
compares them to lions, speaks of them as inflamed with fury or implacable
hatred, and likens their teeth to spears and arrows. In what he says of their
tongue, he alludes to the virulent calumnies which are vended by the wicked, and
which inflict a deeper wound than any sword upon the innocent party who suffers
from them. David, as is well known, encountered no heavier trial than the false
and calumnious charges which were levelled against him by his enemies. When we
hear of the cruel persecution of different kinds which this saint was called
upon to endure, we should account it no hardship to be involved in the same
conflict, but be satisfied so long as we may bring our complaints to the Lord,
who can bridle the false tongue, and put an arrest upon the hand of
violence.</font><br><font face="Palatino">To him we find David appealing in the
words that follow, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Exalt thyself,

of this prayer, it is necessary that we reflect upon the height of audacity and
pride to which the wicked proceed, when unrestrained by the providence of God,
and upon the formidable nature of that conspiracy which was directed against
David by Saul, and the nation in general, all which demanded a signal
manifestation of divine power on his behalf. Nor is it a small comfort to
consider that God, in appearing for the help of his people, at the same time
advances his own glory. Against it, as well as against them, is the opposition
of the wicked directed, and he will never suffer his glory to be obscured, or
his holy name to be polluted with their blasphemies. The Psalmist reverts to the
language of complaint. He had spoken of the cruel persecution to which he was
subjected, and now bewails the treachery and deceit which were practiced against
him. His soul he describes as being
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bowed
down</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>in allusion to the crouching of
the body when one is under the influence of fear, or to birds when terrified by
the fowler and his nets, which dare not move a feather, but lie flat upon the
ground. Some read, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He has bowed

obvious rendering, and the verb

must understand David as saying that he had well and duly meditated upon the
praises which he was about to offer; that he did not rush into a hurried and
perfunctory discharge of this service, as too many are apt to do, but addressed
himself to it with steadfast purpose of heart. I prefer, however, the other
translation, which bears that he was ready to enter upon the service with all
cheerfulness and cordiality. And although, wherever this spirit is really felt,
it will lead to steadfastness of religious exercise, it is not without
importance that the reader should be apprised of the force of the word which is
here employed in the Hebrew. The ready heart is here opposed by David to the
mere lip-service of the hypocrite, on the one hand, and to dead or sluggish
service, on the other. He addressed himself to this voluntary sacrifice with a
sincere fervor of spirit, casting aside sloth, and whatever might prove a
hinderance in the duty.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.<i>

signification, it bears the other in the sixteenth psalm, and in numerous places
of Scripture. The context proves this to be its signification here, David
intimating that he would celebrate the praises of God both with the voice and
with instrumental music. He assigns the first place to the heart, the second to
declaration with the mouth, the third to such accompaniments as stimulate to
greater ardor in the service. It matters little whether we render the verb

that David, in the sufferings spoken of throughout the psalm, represented
Christ. This it is important to observe, as it proves that our own state and
character are set before us in this psalm as in a glass. That the words have
reference to Christ's kingdom, we have the authority of Paul for concluding,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451509&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
15:9,) and, indeed, might sufficiently infer in the exercise of an enlightened
judgment upon the passage. To proclaim the praises of God to such as are deaf,
would be an absurdity much greater than singing them to the rocks and stones; it
is therefore evident that the Gentiles are supposed to be brought to the
knowledge of God when this declaration of his name is addressed to them. He
touches briefly upon what he designed as the sum of his song of praise, when he
adds, that the whole world is full of the goodness and truth of God. I have
already had occasion to observe, that the order in which these divine
perfections are generally mentioned is worthy of attention. It is of his mere
goodness that God is induced to promise so readily and so liberally. On the
other hand, his faithfulness is commended to our notice, to convince us that he
is as constant in fulfilling his promises as he is ready and willing to make
them. The Psalmist concludes with a prayer that God would arise, and not suffer
his glory to be obscured, or the audacity of the wicked to become intolerable by
conniving longer at their impiety. The words, however, may be understood in
another sense, as a prayer that God would hasten the calling of the Gentiles, of
which he had already spoken in the language of prediction, and illustrate his
power by executing not only an occasional judgment in Judea for the deliverance
of distressed innocence, but his mighty judgments over the whole world for the
subjection of the nations.</font><br></div>

</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Do ye indeed speak
righteousness?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In putting this question
to his enemies, by way of challenge, David displays the boldness of conscious
rectitude. It argues that the justice of our cause is demonstratively evident
when we venture to appeal to the opposite party himself; for were there any
ground to question its justice, it would show an absurd degree of confidence to
challenge the testimony of an adversary. David comes forward with the openness
of one who was supported by a sense of his integrity, and repels, by a
declaration forced from their own lips, the base charges with which they
blackened his character in the estimation of such as were simple enough to
believe them. "Ye yourselves," as if he had said, "can attest my innocence, and
yet persecute me with groundless calumnies. Are you not ashamed of such gross
and gratuitous oppression?" It is necessary, however, to determine who they were
whom David here accuses. He calls them a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>congregation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and again, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sons of

</i>some consider to be an epithet applied to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and translate <i>dumb;</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb347</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>but this does not express the
meaning of the Psalmist. Interpreters differ as to what we should understand by
the term <i>congregation. </i>Some think that he adverts, by way of accusation,
to the meetings which his enemies held, as is usual with those who entertain
wicked designs, for the purpose of concerting their plans. I rather incline to
the opinion of those who conceive that he here gives (although only in courtesy)
the usual title of honor to the counsellors of Saul, who met professedly to
consult for the good of the nation, but in reality with no other intention than
to accomplish his destruction. Others read, <i>in the congregation &#8212; </i>a
translation which gives the same meaning to the passage we have already assigned
to it, but is not supported by the natural construction of the words. The
congregation which David addresses is that assembly which Saul convened,
ostensibly for lawful objects, but really for the oppression of the innocent.
The term, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sons of
men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which he immediately afterwards
applies to them &#8212; taking back, as it were, the title of courtesy formerly
given &#8212; would seem to be used in contempt of their character, being, as
they were, rather a band of public robbers than a convention of judges. Some,
however, may be of opinion, that in employing this expression, David had in his
eye the universality of the opposition which confronted him &#8212; almost the
whole people inclining to this wicked factions and that he here issues a
magnanimous defiance to the multitude of his enemies. Meanwhile, the lesson
taught us by the passage is apparent. Although the whole world be set against
the people of God they need not fear, so long as they are supported by a sense
of their integrity, to challenge kings and their counsellors, and the
promiscuous mob of the people. Should the whole world refuse to hear us, we must
learn, by the example of David, to rest satisfied with the testimony of a good
conscience, and with appealing to the tribunal of God. Augustine, who had none
but the Greek version in his hands, is led by this verse into a subtle
disquisition upon the point, that the judgment of men is usually correct when
called to decide upon general principles, but fails egregiously in the
application of these principles to particular
cases,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb348</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> through the blinding and warping
influences of their evil passions. All this may be plausible, and, in its own
place, useful, but proceeds upon a complete misapprehension of the meaning of
the passage.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yea, rather, in heart ye
plot wickedness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In the former verse he
complained of the gross shamelessness manifested in their conduct. Now he
charges them both with entertaining wickedness in their thoughts, and practising
it with their hands. I have accordingly translated the Hebrew article
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&atilde;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aph, </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>yea,
rather</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> &#8212; </i>it being evident that
David proceeds, after first repelling the calumnies of his enemies, to the
further step of challenging them with the sins which they had themselves
committed. The second clause of the verse may be rendered in two different ways,
<i>ye</i> <i>weigh violence with your hands, </i>or, <i>your hands weigh
violence; </i>and as the meaning is the same, it is immaterial which the reader
may adopt. Some think that he uses the figurative expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
weigh,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>in allusion to the pretense of
equity under which he was persecuted, as if he were a disturber of the peace,
and chargeable with treason and contumacy towards the king. In all probability,
his enemies glossed over their oppression with plausible pretences, such as
hypocrites are never slow to discover. But the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">slp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>phalas, </i>admits of a wider signification, <i>to frame </i>or <i>set in
order; </i>and nothing more may be meant than that they put into shape the sins
which they had first conceived in their thoughts. It is added, <i>upon the
earth, </i>to denote the unbridled license of their wickedness, which was done
openly, and not in places where concealment might have been
practiced.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They are estranged, being
wicked from the womb.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He adduces, in
aggravation of their character, the circumstance, that they were not sinners of
recent date, but persons born to commit sin. We see some men, otherwise not so
depraved in disposition, who are drawn into evil courses through levity of mind,
or bad example, or the solicitation of appetite, or other occasions of a similar
kind; but David accuses his enemies of being leavened with wickedness from the
womb, alleging that their treachery and cruelty were born with them. We all come
into the world stained with sin, possessed, as Adam's posterity, of a nature
essentially depraved, and incapable, in ourselves, of aiming at anything which
is good; but there is a secret restraint upon most men which prevents them from
proceeding all lengths in iniquity. The stain of original sin cleaves to the
whole humanity without exception; but experience proves that some are
characterised by modesty and decency of outward deportment; that others are
wicked, yet, at the same time, within bounds of moderation; while a third class
are so depraved in disposition as to be intolerable members of society. Now, it
is this excessive wickedness &#8212; too marked to escape detestation even
amidst the general corruption of mankind &#8212; which David ascribes to his
enemies. He stigmatises them as monsters of
iniquity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.<i>

fb349</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He prosecutes his description;
and, though he might have insisted on the fierceness which characterised their
opposition, he charges them more particularly, here as elsewhere, with the
malicious virulence of their disposition. Some read, <i>their
fury;</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb350</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>but this does not suit the
figure, by which they are here compared to serpents. No objection can be drawn
to the translation we have adopted from the etymology of the word, which is
derived from <i>heat. </i>It is well known, that while some poisons kill by
cold, others consume the vital parts by a burning heat. David then asserts of
his enemies, in this passage, that they were as full of deadly malice as
serpents are full of poison. The more emphatically to express their consummate
subtlety, he compares them to deaf serpents, which shut their ears against the
voice of the charmer &#8212; not the common kind of serpents, but such as are
famed for their cunning, and are upon their guard against every artifice of that
description. But is there such a thing, it may be asked, as enchantment? If
there were not, it might seem absurd and childish to draw a comparison from it,
unless we suppose David to speak in mere accommodation to mistaken, though
generally received opinion.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb351</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He would certainly seem, however, to
insinuate that serpents can be fascinated by enchantment; and I can see no harm
in granting it. The Marsi in Italy were believed by the ancients to excel in the
art. Had there been no enchantments practiced, where was the necessity of their
being forbidden and condemned under the Law?
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051811&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
18:11.) I do not mean to say that there is an actual method or art by which
fascination can be effected. It was doubtless done by a mere sleight of
Satan,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb352</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> whom God has suffered to practice his
delusions upon unbelieving and ignorant men, although he prevents him from
deceiving those who have been enlightened by his word and Spirit. But we may
avoid all occasion for such curious inquiry, by adopting the view already
referred to, that David here borrows his comparison from a popular and
prevailing error, and is to be merely supposed as saying, that no kind of
serpent was imbued with greater craft than his enemies, not even the species (if
such there were) which guards itself against
enchantment.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

fb355</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>From this part of the psalm he
assumes the language of imprecation, and solicits the vengeance of God, whose
peculiar prerogative it is to repel oppression and vindicate injured innocence.
It is necessary, however, that we attend to the manner in which this is done. He
does not claim the judgment or patronage of God to his cause, until he had, in
the first place, asserted his integrity, and stated his complaint against the
malicious conduct of his enemies; for God can never be expected to undertake a
cause which is unworthy of defense. In the verse before us, he prays that God
would crush the wicked, and restrain the violence of their rage. By their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>teeth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he would intimate that they resembled wild beasts in their desire to rend
and destroy the victims of their oppression; and this is brought out more
clearly in the latter part of the verse, where he likens them to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lions</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>The comparison denotes the fury with which they were bent upon his
destruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the next verse, and in the
several succeeding verses, he prosecutes the same purpose, employing a variety
of apt similitudes. He prays that God would make them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>flow away like
waters</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, swiftly. The expression
indicates the greatness of his faith. His enemies were before his eyes in all
the array of their numbers and resources; he saw that their power was deeply
rooted and firmly established; the whole nation was against him, and seemed to
rise up before him like a hopeless and formidable barrier of rocky mountains. To
pray that this solid and prodigious opposition should melt down and disappear,
evidenced no small degree of courage, and the event could only appear credible
to one who had learnt to exalt the power of God above all intervening obstacles.
In the comparison which immediately follows, he prays that the attempts of his
adversaries might be frustrated, the meaning of the words being, that their
arrows might fall powerless, as if broken, when they bent their bow. Actuated as
they were by implacable cruelty, he requests that God would confound their
enterprises, and in this we are again called to admire his unshaken courage,
which could contemplate the formidable preparations of his enemies as completely
at the disposal of God, and their whole power as lying at his feet. Let his
example in this particular point be considered. Let us not cease to pray, even
after the arrows of our enemies have been fitted to the string, and destruction
might seem
inevitable.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>Let him vanish like a snail, which melts
away</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The two comparisons in this verse
are introduced with the same design as the first, expressing his desire that his
enemies might pass away quietly, and prove as things in their own nature the
most evanescent. He likens them to

fb356</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and it might appear ridiculous
in David to use such contemptible figures when speaking of men who were
formidable for their strength and influence, did we not reflect that he
considered God as able in a moment, without the slightest effort, to crush and
annihilate the mightiest opposition. Their power might be such as encouraged
them, in their vain-confidence, to extend their schemes into a far distant
futurity, but he looked upon it with the eye of faith, and saw it doomed in the
judgment of God to be of short continuance. He perhaps alluded to the suddenness
with which the wicked rise into power, and designed to dash the pride which they
are apt to feel from such an easy advance to prosperity, by reminding them that
their destruction would be equally rapid and sudden. There is the same force in
the figure employed in the end of the verse where they are compared to <i>an
abortion. </i>If we consider the length of time to which they contemplate in
their vain-confidence that their life shall
extend,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

</i></b><i>Before your pots can feel the fire of your

verse, arising partly from the perplexed construction, and partly from the words
being susceptible of a double meaning.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb358</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Thus the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twrys</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>

first signification, we must read,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before your pots feel the fire
which has been kindled by thorns</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>if the
second, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before your thorns grow
to a bush</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, reach their full
height and thickness. What, following the former sense, we have translated
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>flesh yet
raw</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>must be rendered, provided we adopt
the other, <i>tender, or not yet grown. </i>But the scope of the Psalmist in the
passage is sufficiently obvious. He refers to the swiftness of that judgment
which God would execute upon his enemies, and prays that he would carry them
away as by a whirlwind, either before they arrived at the full growth of their
strength, like the thorn sprung to the vigorous plant, or before they came to
maturity and readiness, like flesh which has been boiled in the pot. The latter
meaning would seem to be the one of which the passage is most easily
susceptible, that God, in the whirlwind of his anger, would carry away the
wicked like flesh not yet boiled, which may be said scarcely to have felt the
heat of the fire.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

appear at first sight that the feeling here attributed to the righteous is far
from being consistent with the mercy which ought to characterise them; but we
must remember, as I have often observed elsewhere, that the affection which
David means to impute to them is one of a pure and well-regulated kind; and in
this case there is nothing absurd in supposing that believers, under the
influence and guidance of the Holy Ghost, should rejoice in witnessing the
execution of divine judgments. That cruel satisfaction which too many feel when
they see their enemies destroyed, is the result of the unholy passions of
hatred, anger, or impatience, inducing an inordinate desire of revenge. So far
as corruption is suffered to operate in this manner, there can be no right or
acceptable exercise. On the other hand, when one is led by a holy zeal to
sympathise with the justness of that vengeance which God may have inflicted, his
joy will be as pure in beholding the retribution of the wicked, as his desire
for their conversion and salvation was strong and unfeigned. God is not
prevented by his mercy from manifesting, upon fit occasions, the severity of the
judge, when means have been tried in vain to bring the sinner to repentance, nor
can such an exercise of severity be considered as impugning his clemency; and,
in a similar way, the righteous would anxiously desire the conversion of their
enemies, and evince much patience under injury, with a view to reclaim them to
the way of salvation: but when wilful obstinacy has at last brought round the
hour of retribution, it is only natural that they should rejoice to see it
inflicted, as proving the interest which God feels in their personal safety. It
grieves them when God at any time seems to connive at the persecutions of their
enemies; and how then can they fail to feel satisfaction when he awards deserved
punishment to the transgressor?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So that a man shall say,
Verily there is a reward. </i></font><font face="Palatino">We have additional
evidence from what is here said of the cause or source of it, that the joy
attributed to the saints has no admixture of bad feeling. It is noticeable from
the way in which this verse runs, that David would now seem to ascribe to all,
without exception, the sentiment which before he imputed exclusively to the
righteous. But the acknowledgement immediately subjoined is one which could only
come from the saints who have an eye to observe the divine dispensations; and I
am, therefore, of opinion that they are specially alluded to in the expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And a man shall
say</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc<i>. </i>At the same time, this
mode of speech may imply that many, whose minds had been staggered, would be
established in the faith. The righteous only are intended, but the indefinite
form of speaking is adopted to denote their numbers. It is well known how many
there are whose faith is apt to be shaken by apparent inequalities and
perplexities in the divine administration, but who rally courage, and undergo a
complete change of views, when the arm of God is bared in the manifestation of
his judgments. At such a time the acknowledgement expressed in this verse is
widely and extensively adopted, as Isaiah declares,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"When thy judgments are
in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;232609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
26:9.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Hebrew particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#176;a</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
ach, </i>which we have translated
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>verily</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>occasionally denotes simple affirmation, but is generally intensitive, and
here implies the contrast between that unbelief which we are tempted to feel
when God has suspended the exercise of his judgments, and the confidence with
which we are inspired when he executes them. Thus the particles which are
repeated in the verse imply that men would put away that hesitancy which is apt
to steal upon their minds when God forbears the infliction of the punishment of
sin, and, as it were, correct themselves for the error into which they had been
seduced. Nothing tends more to promote godliness than an intimate and assured
persuasion that the righteous shall never lose their reward. Hence the language
of Isaiah, "Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him; for they
shall eat the fruit of their doings,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
3:10.) When righteousness is not rewarded, we are disposed to cherish
unbelieving fears, and to imagine that God has retired from the government of
the world, and is indifferent to its concerns. I shall have an opportunity of
treating this point more at large upon the seventy-third
psalm.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There is subjoined the reason why the

supposition of the world being ruled by the providence of God, that he should
not, sooner or later, distinguish between the good and the evil. He is said more
particularly to judge <i>in the earth, </i>because men have sometimes profanely
alleged that the government of God is confined to heaven, and the affairs of
this world abandoned to blind chance.</font><br></div>

the preceding. He begins by insisting upon the injustice of that cruel hostility
which his enemies showed to him, and which he had done nothing to deserve. His
complaint is followed up by prayer to God for help; and afterwards, as his hopes
revive in the exercise of devout meditation, he proceeds to prophesy their
calamitous destruction. At the close, he engages to preserve a grateful
remembrance of his deliverance, and to praise the goodness of
God.</font><br></div>

Samuel 19:11.) Besieged in his own house by a troop of soldiers, and having no

was indebted instrumentally for his deliverance to the ingenuity of his wife,
but it was from the divine goodness that he looked for safety. Michal may have
contrived the artifice which deceived the soldiers sent by her father, but he
never could have been saved except through the wonderful preservation of God. We
are told in the words of the title that his house was watched, and this amounts,
in the circumstances, to its being said that he was shut up to certain
destruction; for the emissaries of Saul were sent with orders not only for his

strength and violence of his enemies, with the view of exciting his mind to
greater fervor in the duty of prayer. These he describes as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rising up

simply to the audacity or fierceness of their assaults, but to the eminent
superiority of power which they possessed; and yet he asks that he may be lifted
up on high, as it were, above the reach of this over-swelling inundation. His
language teaches us that we should believe in the ability of God to deliver us
even upon occasions of emergency, when our enemies have an overwhelming
advantage. In the verse which follows, while he expresses the extremity to which
he was reduced, he adverts at the same time to the injustice and cruelty of his
persecutors. Immediately afterwards, he connects the two grounds of his
complaint together: on the one hand, his complete helplessness under the danger,
and, on the other, the undeserved nature of the assaults from which he suffered.
I have already repeatedly observed, that our confidence in our applications to a
throne of grace will be proportional to the degree in which we are conscious of
integrity; for we cannot fail to feel greater liberty in pleading a cause which,
in such a case, is the cause of God himself. He is the vindicator of justice,
the patron of the righteous cause everywhere, and those who oppress the innocent
must necessarily rank themselves amongst his enemies. David accordingly founds
his first plea upon his complete destitution of all earthly means of help,
exposed as he was to plots on every side, and attacked by a formidable
conspiracy. His second he rests upon a declaration of innocency. It may be true
that afflictions are sent by God to his people as a chastisement for their sins,
but, so far as Saul was concerned, David could justly exonerate himself from all
blame, and takes this occasion of appealing to God on behalf of his integrity,
which lay under suspicion from the base calumnies of men. They might pretend it,
but he declares that they could charge him with no crime nor fault. Yet,
groundless as their hostility was, he tells us that they <i>ran, </i>were
unremitting in their activity, with no other view than to accomplish the ruin of
their victim.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Awake to hasten for my
help, and behold.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In using this
language, he glances at the eagerness with which his enemies, as he had already
said, were pressing upon him, and states his desire that God would show the same
haste in extending help as they did in seeking his destruction. With the view of
conciliating the divine favor, he once more calls upon God to be the witness and
judge of his cause, adding,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> and
behold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The expression is one which
savours at once of faith and of the infirmity of the flesh. In speaking of God,
as if his eyes had been hitherto shut to the wrongs which he had suffered, and
needed now for the first time to be opened for the discovery of them, he
expresses himself according to the weakness of our human apprehension. On the
other hand, in calling upon God <i>to behold </i>his cause, he shows his faith
by virtually acknowledging that nothing was hid from his providential
cognisance. Though David may use language of this description, suited to the
infirmity of sense, we must not suppose him to have doubted before this time
that his afflictions, his innocence, and his wrongs, were known to God. Now,
however, he lays the whole before God for examination and
decision.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He prosecutes the same prayer with
still greater vehemency in the verse which succeeds. He addresses God under new
titles, calling him </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah, God
of Hosts, and the God of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the
first of which appellations denotes the immensity of his power, and the second
the special care which he exerts over the Church, and over all his people. The
manner in which the pronoun is introduced,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and
Thou</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc., </i>is emphatical, denoting that
it was as impossible for God to lay aside the office of a judge as to deny
himself, or divest himself of his being. He calls upon him <i>to visit all the
nations: </i>for although the cause which he now submitted was of no such
universal concernment, the wider exercise of judgment would necessarily include
the lesser; and on the supposition of heathens and foreigners being subjected to
the judgment of God, it followed that a still more certain and heavy doom would
be awarded to enemies within the pale of the Church, who persecuted the saints
under the guise of brethren, and overthrew those laws which were of divine
appointment. The opposition which David encountered might not embrace
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but if these were judicially
visited by God, it was absurd to imagine that those within the Church would be
the only enemies who should escape with impunity. In using these words, it is
probable also that he may have been struggling with a temptation with which he
was severely assailed, connected with the number of his enemies, for these did
not consist merely of three or four abandoned individuals. They formed a great
multitude; and he rises above them all by reflecting that God claims it as his
prerogative, not only to reduce a few refractory persons to submission, but to
punish the wickedness of the whole world. If the judgments of God extended to
the uttermost parts of the earth, there was no reason why he should be afraid of
his enemies, who, however numerous, formed but a small section of the human
race. We shall shortly see, however, that the expression admits of being applied
without impropriety to the Israelites, divided, as they were, into so many
tribes or peoples. In the words which follow, when he deprecates the extension
of God's mercy to wicked transgressors, we must understand him as referring to
the reprobate, whose sin was of a desperate character. We must also remember,
what has been already observed, that in such prayers he was not influenced by
mere private feelings, and these of a rancorous, distempered, and inordinate
description. Not only did he know well that those of whom he speaks with such
severity were already doomed to destruction, but he is here pleading the common
cause of the Church, and this under the influence of the pure and well-regulated
zeal of the Spirit. He therefore affords no precedent to such as resent private
injuries by vending curses on those who have inflicted
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

famished and furious dogs which hunger impels to course with endless circuits in
every direction, and under this figure accuses their insatiable fierceness,
shown in the ceaseless activity to which they were instigated by the desire of
mischief. He says that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they
return in the evening,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to intimate, not
that they rested at other times, but were indefatigable in pursuing their evil
courses. If they came no speed through the day, yet the night would find them at
their work. The barking of dogs aptly expressed as a figure the formidable
nature of their assaults.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the verse which
follows, he describes their fierceness. The expression, <i>prating, </i>or
belching out with their mouth,<i> </i>denotes that they proclaimed their
infamous counsels openly, and without affecting concealment. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[bn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nabang, </i>means, metaphorically, <i>to speak, </i>but properly, it
signifies <i>to gush out,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb365</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and here denotes more than
simply speaking. He would inform us, that not content with plotting the
destruction of the innocent secretly amongst themselves, they published their
intentions abroad, and boasted of them. Accordingly, when he adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>swords were in their
lips</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he means that they breathed out
slaughter, and that every word they spoke was a sword to slay the oppressed. He
assigns as the cause of their rushing to such excess of <i>wickedness, </i>that
they had no reason to apprehend disgrace. It may be sufficiently probable, that
David adverts here, as in many other places, to the gross stupidity of the
wicked, who, in order to banish fear from their minds, conceive of God as if he
were asleep in heaven; but I am of opinion that he rather traces the security
with which they prosecuted their counsels, and openly proclaimed them, to the
fact, that they had long ere now been in possession of the uncontrolled power of
inflicting injury. They had succeeded so completely in deceiving the people, and
rendering David odious by their calumnies, that none had the courage to utter a
word in his defense. Nay, the more atrociously that any man might choose to
persecute this victim of distress, from no other motive than to secure the good
graces of the king, the more did he rise in estimation as a true friend to the
commonwealth.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But thou, O Jehovah!
shalt laugh at them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In the face of all
this opposition, David only rises to greater confidence. When he says that God
would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>laugh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>at his enemies, he employs a figure which is well fitted to enhance the
power of God, suggesting that, when the wicked have perfected their schemes to
the uttermost, God can, without any effort, and, as it were, in sport, dissipate
them all. No sooner does God connive at their proceedings, than their pride and
insolence take occasion to manifest themselves: for they forget that even when
he seems to have suspended operation, he needs but nod, and his judgments shall
be executed. David, accordingly, in contempt of his adversaries, tells them that
God was under no necessity to make extensive preparations, but, at the moment
when he saw fit to make retribution, would, by a mere play of his power,
annihilate them all. He in this manner conveys a severe rebuke to that blind
infatuation which led them to boast so intemperately of their own powers, and to
imagine that God was slumbering in the heavens. In the close of the verse,
mention is made of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>to intimate that though they
might equal the whole world in numbers, they would prove a mere mockery with all
their influence and resources. Or the words may be read &#8212; Even As
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou hast all the nations in
derision.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>One thing is obvious, that
David ridicules the vain boasting of his enemies, who thought no undertaking too
great to be accomplished by their
numbers.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9<i>.</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>I will intrust his strength to
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The obscurity of this passage has
led to a variety of opinions amongst commentators. The most forced
interpretation which has been proposed is that which supposes a change of person
in the relative
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>as if David, in speaking of himself, employed the third person instead of
the first, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will intrust my
strength to thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Septuagint, and
those who adopt this interpretation, have probably been led to it by the
insufficient reason, that in the last verse of the psalm it is said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will ascribe with praises
</i>my <i>strength to thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, my
<i>strength is with thee, I will sing, etc. </i>But on coming to that part of
the psalm, we will have occasion to see that David there, with propriety,
asserts of himself what he here in another sense asserts of Saul. There can be
no doubt, therefore, that the relative is to be here understood of Saul. Some
consider that the first words of the sentence should be read apart from the
others &#8212; <i>strength is his &#8212; </i>meaning<i> </i>that Saul had the
evident superiority in strength, so as at the present to be triumphant. Others
join the two parts of the sentence, and give this explanation: Although thou art
for the present moment his strength, in so far as thou dost sustain and preserve
him on the throne, yet I will continue to hope, until thou hast raised me to the
kingdom, according to thy promise. But those seem to come nearest the meaning of
the Psalmist who construe the words as one continuous sentence &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will put in trust his strength
with thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>meaning that, however
intemperately Saul might boast of his strength, he would rest satisfied in the
assurance that there was a secret divine providence restraining his actions. We
must learn to view all men as subordinated in this manner, and to conceive of
their strength and their enterprises as depending upon the sovereign will of
God. In my opinion, the following version is the best &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His strength is with
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb366</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
wait.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The words are parallel with those
in the end of the psalm, where there can be no doubt that the nominative case is
employed, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My</i> <i>strength is
with thee; I will sing.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>So far as the
sense of the passage is concerned, however, it does not signify which of the
latter interpretations be followed. It is evident that David is here enabled,
from the eminence of faith, to despise the violent opposition of his enemy,
convinced that he could do nothing without the divine permission. But by taking
the two parts of the sentence separately, in the way I have suggested, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His strength is with thee, I will
wait</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, &#8212; </i>the<i> </i>meaning is more
distinctly brought out. First, David, in vindication of that power by which God
governs the whole world, declares that his enemy was under a secret divine
restraint, and so entirely dependent for any strength which he possessed upon
God, that he could not move a finger without his consent. He then adds, that he
would wait the event, whatsoever it might be, with composure and tranquillity.
For the word which we have translated, <i>I will intrust, </i>may here be taken
as signifying <i>I will keep myself, </i>or quietly wait the pleasure of the
Lord. In this sense we find the word used in the conjugation <i>Niphal,
</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230704&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
7:4. Here it is put in the conjugation <i>Kal, </i>but that is no reason why we
may not render it, "I will silently wait the issue which God may send." It has
been well suggested, that David may allude to the guards which had been sent to
besiege his house, and be considered as opposing to this a watch of a very
different description, which he himself maintained, as he looked out for the
divine issue with quietness and
composure.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

lying.	</font><br><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The God of my mercy will
prevent me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In the Hebrew, there is the
affix of the third person, but we have the point which denotes the
first.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb368</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The Septuagint has adopted the third
person, and Augustine too ingeniously, though with a good design, has repeatedly
quoted the passage against the Pelagians, in proof that the grace of God is
antecedent to all human merit. In the same manner, he has again and again cited
the preceding verse, to refute the arrogancy of those who boast of the power of
free-will. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>"I will put in trust
my strength with thee,"</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he says; "that
is, men must subject themselves with all modesty and humility to God, as having
no strength but that with which he supplies them." Now, it may be said with
great plausibility, that the man <i>puts his strength in trust with God, </i>who
declares that he has no strength but what comes from him, and who depends
entirely upon his help. The sentiment inculcated is also, without all doubt, a
pious and instructive one; but we must be ever on our guard against wresting
Scripture from its natural meaning. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">mdq</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>kidem, </i>means no more than <i>to come forward seasonably; </i>and David
simply intimates that the divine assistance would be promptly and opportunely
extended.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb369</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The scope of the words is, that God
will interpose at the very moment when it is required, however much he may
retard or defer his assistance. Were it not that we are hurried on by the
excessive eagerness of our own wishes, we would sufficiently recognize the
promptness with which God hastens to our help, but our own precipitance makes us
imagine that he is dilatory. To confirm his faith, he calls him
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the God of his
mercy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>having often proved him to be
merciful; and the experience of the past afforded him good hopes of what he
might expect in the future. The idea of some, that David uses the word in an
active sense, and praises his own mercy, is poor and unnatural. Its passive use
is quite common.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Slay them not, lest my
people forget</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>David very properly
suggests this to his own mind, as a consideration which should produce patience.
We are apt to think, when God has not annihilated our enemies at once, that they
have escaped out of his hands altogether; and we look upon it as properly no
punishment, that they should be gradually and slowly destroyed. Such being the
extravagant desire which almost all, without exception, have, to see their
enemies at once exterminated, David checks himself, and dwells upon the judgment
of God to be seen in the lesser calamities which overtake the wicked. It is
true, that were not our eyes blinded, we would behold a more evident display of
divine retribution in cases where the destruction of the ungodly is sudden; but
these are so apt to fade away from our remembrance, that he had good reason to
express his desire that the spectacle might be one constantly renewed, and thus
our knowledge of the judgments of God be more deeply graven upon our hearts. He
arms and fortifies himself against impatience under delays in the execution of
divine judgment, by the consideration that God has an express design in them,
as, were the wicked exterminated in a moment, the remembrance of the event might
speedily be effaced. There is an indirect censure conveyed to the people of
Israel for failing to improve the more striking judgments of God. But the sin is
one too prevalent in the world even at this day. Those judgments which are so
evident that none can miss to observe them without shutting his eyes, we
sinfully allow to pass into oblivion; so that we need to be brought daily into
that theater where we are compelled to perceive the divine hand. This we must
never forget when we see God subjecting his enemies to a gradual process of
destruction, instead of launching his thunders instantly upon their head. He
prays that God would <i>make them to wander, </i>as men under poverty and
misery, who seek in every direction, but in vain, for a remedy to their
misfortunes. The idea is still more forcibly described in the word which
follows, <i>make them descend, </i>or, <i>cast them down. </i>He wished that
they might be dragged from that position of honor which they had hitherto
occupied, and thrown to the ground, so as to present, in their wretchedness and
degradation, a constant illustration of the wrath of God. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#176;lyjb</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>becheylcha, </i>which we have translated,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in thy
power,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>some render, <i>with thy army,
</i>understanding the people of God. But it is more probable that David calls to
his assistance </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
power</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of God for the destruction of his
enemies, and this because they deemed themselves invincible through those
worldly resources in which they trusted. As a further argument for obtaining his
request, he intimates in the close of the verse that he was now pleading the
cause of the whole Church, for he uses the plural number,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O God our
shield</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Having been chosen king by
divine appointment, the safety of the Church stood connected with his person.
The assault made upon him by his enemies was not an assault upon himself merely
as a private individual, but upon the whole people, whose common welfare God had
consulted in making choice of him. And this suggested another reason why he
should patiently submit to see the judgments of God measured out in the manner
which might best engage their minds in assiduous
meditation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12<i>.</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>The sin of their mouth, the words of their
lips</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some interpreters read, <i>for,

their mouth,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb370</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>supplying the causal particle,
that the words may be the better connected with the preceding verse. And there
can be no doubt that the reason is stated here why they deserved to be subjected
to constant wanderings and disquietude. The words as they stand, however,
although abrupt and elliptical, well express the meaning which David would
convey; as if he had said, that no lengthened proof was necessary to convict
them of sin, which plainly showed itself in the mischievous tendency of their
discourse. Wickedness, he tells us, proceeded from their mouth., They vomited
out their pride and cruelty. That this is the sense in which we are to
understand the words, is confirmed by what immediately follows &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let them be taken in their
pride.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He here points to the source of
that insolence which led them with such proud and contumelious language, and in
such a shameless manner, to oppress the innocent. He then specifies the sin of
their lips, adding, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they
spoke words of cursing and falsehood</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By
this he means that their mouth was continually filled with horrid imprecations,
and that they were wholly addicted to deceit and to
calumniating.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb371</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Those have mistaken the meaning of
David who give a passive signification to the word which I have translated <i>to
speak, </i>and understand him as saying that the wicked would be accounted
examples of divine vengeance, the plain and notorious marks of which were
written upon them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

when immediately before he had expressed his desire that they might not be
exterminated at once.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb375</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> What else could he mean when he asks
that God would consume them in wrath, but that he would cut them off suddenly,
and not by a gradual and slower process of punishment? But he evidently refers
in what he says here to a different point of time, and this removes any apparent
inconsistency, for he prays that when they had been set up for a sufficient
period as an example, they might eventually be devoted to destruction. It was
customary with the victorious Roman generals, first to lead the captives which
had been kept for the day of triumph through the city, and afterwards, upon
reaching the capital, to give them over to the lictors for execution. Now David
prays that when God had, in a similar manner, reserved his enemies for an
interval sufficient to illustrate his triumph, he would upon this consign them
to summary punishment. The two things are not at all inconsistent; first, that
the divine judgments should be lengthened out through a considerable period, to
secure their being remembered better, and that then, upon sufficient evidence
being given to the world of the certainty with which the wicked are subjected in
the displeasure of God to the slower process of destruction, he should in due
time bring them forth to final execution, the better to awake, by such a
demonstration of his power, the minds of those who may be more secure than
others, or less affected by witnessing moderate inflictions of punishment. He
adds, accordingly, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they may
know, even to the ends of the earth, that God ruleth in
Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some would insert the copulative
particle, reading, <i>that they may know that God rules in Jacob, and in all the
nations of the world, </i>an interpretation which I do not approve, and which
does violence to the sense. The allusion is to the condign nature of the
judgment, which would be such that the report of it would reach the remotest
regions, and strike salutary terror into the minds even of their benighted and
godless inhabitants. He was more especially anxious that God should be
recognised as ruling <i>in the Church, </i>it being preposterous that the place
where his throne was erected should present such an aspect of confusion as
converted his temple into a den of
thieves.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14<i>.</i>
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And at evening they shall
return</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is of no consequence whether
we read the words in the future tense or in the subjunctive, understanding it to
be a continuance of the preceding prayer. But it seems more probable that David,
after having brought his requests to a close, anticipates the happy issue which
he desired. And he makes an apt allusion to what he had already said of their
insatiable hunger. The words which he had formerly used he repeats, but with a
different application, ironically declaring that they would be ravenous in
another sense, and that matters would issue otherwise than they had looked for.
Above he had complained that they made a noise like dogs, adverting to the
eagerness and fierceness with which they were bent upon mischief; now he derides
their malicious efforts, and says, that after wearying themselves with their
endless pursuit all day, they would go disappointed of their purpose. He uses no
longer the language of complaint, but congratulates himself upon the abortive
issue of their activity. The Hebrew word which I have translated, <i>if not,
</i>in the close of the fifteenth verse, is by some considered to be the form of
an oath. But this is an over-refined interpretation. Others would have the
negation repeated, reading, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>if
they shall not have been satisfied, neither shall they lodge for the
night</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But this also is far-fetched. The
simple and true meaning suggests itself at once, that, although they might not
be satisfied, they would be forced to lay themselves down, and the misery of

that he would have occasion to sing at some future period, but prepares himself
presently for the exercise of thanksgiving; and he proceeds to acknowledge that
his deliverance would be at once an illustrious effect of Divine power, and
conferred of mere grace. It may be true, that David escaped at this time from
the hands of his enemies without stir, and with secrecy, through the dexterity
of his wife; still, by means of this artifice, God disappointed the preparations
and forces of Saul, and may, therefore, with propriety be said to have exerted
his power. We may suppose, however, that David takes occasion, from this
particular instance, to look further back, and embrace, in his view, the various
Divine interpositions which he had
experienced.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17<i>.</i>
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My strength is with thee, I

more explicitly the truth, that he owed his safety entirely to God. Formerly he
had said that the strength of his enemy was with God, and now he asserts the
same thing of his own. The expression, however, which admits of two meanings, he
elegantly applies to himself in a different
sense.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

his hands, to curb and to restrain it, and to show that any power of which they
boast is vain and fallacious. His own people, on the other hand, he supports and
secures, against the possibility of falling, by supplies of strength from
himself. In the preceding part of the psalm, David had congratulated himself
upon his safety, by reflecting that Saul was so completely under the secret
restraint of God's providence as to be unable to move a finger without his
permission. Now, weak as he was in himself, he maintains that he had strength
sufficient in the Lord; and accordingly adds, that he had good reason to engage
in praise, as James the inspired apostle exhorts those who are merry to sing
psalms,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;590513&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">James

is clear that the two clauses must be taken separately, as I have already
observed.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
60</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">David, who was now settled upon the throne, and had
gained several signal victories, tending to confirm him in the kingdom, in this
Psalm exalts the goodness of God, that he might at once express his gratitude,
and by conciliating the favor of such as still stood out against his interests,
unite the community, which had been rent into factions. Having first adverted to
the clear indications of the Divine favor, which proved that God had chosen him
to be king, he more particularly calls the attention of the faithful to the
oracle itself, in order to convince them that they could only comply with the
mind of God, by yielding their consent and approbation to the anointing which he
had received from Samuel. Prayers also are offered up throughout the psalm,
urging God to perfect what he had begun.</font><br></div>

commonly known at the time. It is added, <i>to teach; </i>and this, as some have
thought, because the psalm was given to the Levites, that they might learn it.
But others have very properly rejected this idea, as we cannot suppose that a
title, which is equally applicable to all the psalms, would have been here used
as a term of distinction. More probably it points at a particular instruction or
doctrine, which would be taught by the following psalm. We may suppose that
David, who had gained so many decisive victories, but had not the satisfaction,
as yet, of seeing the kingdom finally settled under him, employs the word to
denote that he had a special lesson to enforce, which was, the duty of all who
had hitherto opposed him to put an end to factions, and, after such convincing
evidences, acknowledge that he was their divinely-appointed king. Let
experience, at least, as if he had said, prove that the sovereignty which I hold
meets with the approbation of God, crowned, as it is, in the eyes of all, with
so many tokens of his favor. The psalm is described as being a kind of triumphal
song for victories obtained over the Syrians and other allied nations. As the
Jews reckon Mesopotamia, and other countries, to be included in Syria, which
they call Aram, they are forced subsequently to distinguish it into different
parts, as here we find <i>Syria Naharim </i>put for Mesopotamia, which some of
the Latins have named Interamnis, (or, <i>between two rivers,) </i>following the
Greek etymology; for Mesopotamia in Greek means between two rivers, that is,
between the Tigris and Euphrates.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb380</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Next, we have <i>Syria Soba
</i>mentioned, which some have considered upon good grounds to be Sophene,
because adjacent to the bank of the Euphrates; and David is said
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;100803&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 8:3) to have smitten Rehob, king of Soba, as he went to recover his
border at the river. In the same passage, we read of a third Syria, that of
Damascus, nearer to Judea, and almost touching upon it. Syria is, in other
places of Scripture, represented as still more extensive, and has epithets
attached to it according to the different territories which are meant to be
pointed out. As David had war with the more adjacent part of Syria, and routed
the army which had come out from it to the assistance of the Ammonites, it may
be asked why he speaks only of the inhabitants of Mesopotamia and Soba. I think
it probable that he specifies the more distant nations, as being the most
formidable, and as affording a more illustrious proof of the Divine favor which
accompanied his arms. For this reason, he passes over the more neighboring
nations, and mentions those which were situated at a distance, the terror of
which was known only by report, and whose overthrow was something unheard of,
and almost incredible. In the inspired history, two-and-twenty thousand are said
to have been slain,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;131812&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Chronicles 18:12,) in the title of this psalm only twelve thousand; but the
apparent inconsistency is easily explained. It is Abishai whom the history
represents as defeating the forces, which are here said to have been overthrown
by Joab. We are to consider that the army was divided between the two brothers.
Abishai being inferior in rank and authority, we need not wonder that the praise
of the victory is ascribed to him who was the chief commander, although both had
a share in gaining it; as in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;091807&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 18:7, David is described as having the whole honor of the victory,
because he was the individual under whose auspices it had been accomplished. It
is probable that about half the number mentioned in the history fell during the
main engagement, and that the rest having fled from the field, were put to the
sword by Joab in their retreat.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

others to a more serious consideration of the goodness of God, which they
presently experienced, he begins the psalm with prayer; and a comparison is
instituted, designed to show that the government of Saul had been under the
divine reprobation. He complains of the sad confusions into which the nation had
been thrown, and prays that God would return to it in mercy, and re-establish
its affairs. Some have thought that David here adverts to his own distressed
condition: this is not probable. I grant that, before coming to the throne, he
underwent severe afflictions; but in this place he evidently speaks of the whole
people as well as himself. The calamities which he describes are such as
extended to the whole kingdom; and I have not the least doubt, therefore, that
he is to be considered as drawing a comparison which might illustrate the favor
of God, as it had been shown so remarkably, from the first, to his own
government. With this view, he deplores the long-continued and heavy disasters
which had fallen upon the people of God under Saul's administration. It is
particularly noticeable, that though he had found his own countrymen his worst
and bitterest foes, now that he sat upon the throne, he forgets all the injuries
which they had done him, and, mindful only of the situation which he occupied,
associates himself with the rest of them in his addresses to God. The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>scattered</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>condition of the nation is what he insists upon as the main calamity. In
consequence of the dispersion of Saul's forces, the country lay completely
exposed to the incursions of enemies; not a man was safe in his own house, and
no relief remained but in flight or banishment. He next describes the confusions
which reigned by a metaphor, representing the country as <i>opened, </i>or
<i>cleft asunder; </i>not that there had been a literal earthquake, but that the
kingdom, in its rent and shattered condition, presented that calamitous aspect
which generally follows upon an earthquake. The affairs of Saul ceased to
prosper from the time that he forsook God; and when he perished at last, he left
the nation in a state little short of ruin. The greatest apprehension must have
been felt throughout it; it was become the scorn of its enemies, and was ready
to submit to any yoke, however degrading, which promised tolerable conditions.
Such is the manner in which David intimates that the divine favor had been
alienated by Saul, pointing, when he says that God was <i>displeased, </i>at the
radical source of all the evils which prevailed; and he prays that the same
physician who had broken would heal.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast showed thy
people hard things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He says, first, that
the nation had been dealt with severely, and then adds a figure which may
additionally represent the grievousness of its calamities, speaking of it as
drunk with the wine of stupor or astonishment. Even the Hebraist interpreters
are not agreed among themselves as to the meaning of
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hl[rt</font><font face="Palatino">,

the Jews were stupified by their
calamities.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

David diverges to the language of congratulation, and, by pointing to the change
which had taken place, calls attention to the evident appearances of the divine
favor. He returns thanks to God, in the name of all the people, for having
raised a standard which might at once cheer their hearts, and unite their
divided numbers.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb388</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is a poor and meagre interpretation
which some have attached to the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before the
truth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that God showed favor to the Jews
because he had found them true-hearted, and sound in his cause. Those in the
higher ranks had, as is well known, proved eminently disloyal; the common people
had, along with their king, broken their divine allegiance: from the highest to
the lowest in the kingdom all had conspired to overthrow the gracious purpose of
God. It is evident, then, that David refers to the truth of God as having
emerged in a signal manner, now that the Church began to be restored. This was
an event which had not been expected. Indeed, who did not imagine, in the
desperate circumstances, that God's promises had altogether failed? But when
David mounted the throne, his truth, which had been so long obscured, again
shone forth. The advantage which ensued extended to the whole nation; but David
intimates that God had a special respect to his own people, whose deliverance,
however few they might be in number, he particularly
contemplated.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He next proceeds to address God
again in prayer; although, I may observe in passing, the words which follow,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that thy beloved may be
delivered</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>are read by some in
connection with the preceding verse. I am myself inclined to adopt that
construction; for David would seem to magnify the illustration which had been
given of the divine favor, by adverting to the change which had taken
place,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb389</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> God having inspirited his people so far
as to display a banner; where, formerly, they were reduced to a state of
extremity, from which it seemed impossible to escape without a miracle. In the
previous verse he calls them <i>fearers </i>of the Lord, and now his <i>beloved;
</i>implying that, when God rewards such as fear and worship him, it is always
with a respect to his own free love. And prayer is subjoined: for however great
may be the favors which God has bestowed upon us, modesty and humility will
teach us always to pray that he would perfect what his goodness has
begun.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Hitherto he has adverted to the proofs which
had come under their own observation, and from which they might easily see that
God had manifested his favor in a manner new, and for many years unprecedented.
He had raised the nation from a state of deep distress to prosperity, and had
changed the aspect of affairs so far, that one victory was following another in
rapid succession. But now he calls their attention to a point of still greater
importance, the divine promise &#8212; the fact that God had previously declared
all this with his own mouth. However numerous and striking may be the practical
demonstrations we receive of the favor of God, we can never recognize them,
except in connection with his previously revealed promise. What follows,
although spoken by David as of himself individually, may be considered as the
language adopted by the people generally, of whom he was the political head.
Accordingly, he enjoins them, provided they were not satisfied with the sensible
proofs of divine favor, to reflect upon the oracle by which he had been made
king in terms the most distinct and
remarkable.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb390</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He says that God had spoken
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in his
holiness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>not <i>by his Holy Spirit,
</i>as some, with an over-refinement of interpretation, have rendered it, nor
<i>by</i> <i>his holy place, the
sanctuary;</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb391</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for we read of no response
having been given from it to the prophet Samuel. It is best to retain the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>holiness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>as he adverts to the fact of the truth of the oracle having been confirmed,
and the constancy and efficacy of the promise having been placed beyond all
doubt by numerous proof, of a practical kind. As no room had been left for
question upon the point, he employs this epithet to put honor upon the words
which had been spoken by Samuel. He immediately adds, that this word of God was
the chief ground upon which he placed his trust. It might be true that he had
gained many victories, and that these had tended to encourage his heart; but he
intimates, that no testimony which he had received of this kind gave him so much
satisfaction as the word. This accords with the general experience of the Lord's
people. Cheered, as they unquestionably are, by every expression of the divine
goodness, still faith must ever be considered as holding the highest place
&#8212; as being that which dissipates their worst sorrows, and quickens them
even when dead to a happiness which is not of this world. Nor does David mean
that he merely rejoiced himself. He includes, in general, all who feared the
Lord in that Kingdom. And now he proceeds to give the sum of the oracle, which
it is observable that he does in such a way as to show, in the very narration of
it, how firmly he believed in its truth: for he speaks of it as something which
admitted of no doubt whatsoever, and boasts that he would do what God had
promised. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will divide Shechem,
he says, and mete out the valley of
Succoth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb392</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The parts which he names are
those that were more late of coming into his possession, and which would appear
to have been yet in the hands of Saul's son, when this psalm was written. A
severe struggle being necessary for their acquisition, he asserts that, though
late of being subdued, they would certainly be brought under his subjection in
due time, as God had condescended to engage this by his word. So with
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Gilead and
Manasseh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb393</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ephraim</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>was the most populous of all the tribes, he appropriately terms it the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>strength of his
head</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, of his
dominions.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb394</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> To procure the greater credit to the
oracle, by showing that it derived a sanction from antiquity, he adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>would be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his
lawgiver</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or <i>chief; </i>which was
equivalent to saying, that the posterity of Abraham could never prosper unless,
in agreeableness to the prediction of the patriarch Jacob, they were brought
under the government of Judah, or of one who was sprung from that tribe. He
evidently alludes to what is narrated by Moses,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014910&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
49:10,) "The<i> </i>scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from
between his feet, until Shiloh come." The same word is there used,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qqwjm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>Mechokek, </i>or legislator. It followed, that no government could stand
which was not resident in the tribe of Judah, this being the decree and the good
pleasure of God. The words are more appropriate in the mouth of the people than
of David; and, as already remarked, he does not speak in his own name, but in
that of the Church at
large.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8<i>.</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>Moab is my wash-pot</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In
proceeding to speak of foreigners, he observes a wide distinction between them
and his own countrymen. The posterity of Abraham he would govern as brethren,
and not as slaves; but it was allowable for him to exercise greater severities
upon the profane and the uncircumcised, in order to their being brought under
forcible subjection. In this he affords no precedent to conquerors who would
inflict lawless oppression upon nations taken in war; for they want the divine
warrant and commission which David had, invested as he was not only with the
authority of a king, but with the character of an avenger of the Church,
especially of its more implacable enemies, such as had thrown off every feeling
of humanity, and persisted in harassing a people descended from the same stock
with themselves. He remarks, in contempt of the Moabites, that they would be a
vessel in which he should wash his feet, the washing of the feet being, as is
well known, a customary practice in Eastern
nations.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb395</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> With the same view he speaks of casting
his shoe over Edom. This is expressive of reproach, and intimates, that as it
had once insulted over the chosen people of God, so now it should be reduced to
servitude.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb396</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> What follows concerning Palestina is
ambiguous. By some the words are taken ironically, as if David would deride the
vain boastings of the Philistines, who were constantly assaulting him with all
the petulance which they could
command.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb397</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And the Hebrew verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[wr</font><font face="Palatino">,

also to make a tumult, as soldiers when they rush to battle. Others, without
supposing any ironical allusion, take the words as they stand, and interpret
them as meaning servile plaudits; that much and obstinately as they hated his
dominion, they would be forced to hail and applaud him as conqueror. Thus in

objection which might be alleged, he proceeds to state that he looked to God for
the accomplishment of what remained to be done in the capture of the fortified
places of his enemies, and the consolidation of his victories. It might be said,
that as a considerable number continued to resist his claims, the confident
terms which he had used were premature. God, however, had pledged his word that
every nation which set itself in opposition to him would be brought under his
power, and in the face of remaining difficulties and dangers he advances with
certainty of success. By the

capital of the Moabites. Others, with more probability, consider that the
singular is used for the plural number, and that David alludes in general to the
different cities under protection of which his enemies were determined to stand
out. He declares, that the same God who had crowned his arms with victory in the
open field would lead him on to the siege of these cities. With a view to prove
his legitimate call to the government, he amplifies a second time the marks of
the divine favor which it had received, by contrasting it with that which
preceded. "The<i> </i>God," he says, "who had formerly cast us off, and
abandoned us to unsuccessful warfare, will now lay open before me the gates of
hostile cities, and enable me to break through all their
fortifications."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11<i>.</i>

reverts to the exercise of prayer, or rather is led to it naturally by the very
confidence of hope, which we have seen that he entertained. He expresses his
conviction, that should God extend his help, it would be sufficient of itself,
although no assistance should be received from any other quarter. Literally it
reads, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Give us help from trouble,
and vain is the help of man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>"O God," as
if he had said, "when pleased to put forth thy might, thou needest none to help
thee; and when, therefore, once assured of an interest in thy favor, there is no
reason why we should desire the aid of man. All other resources of a worldly
nature vanish before the brightness of thy power." The copulative in the verse,
however, has been generally resolved into the causal particle, and I have not
scrupled to follow the common practice. It were well if the sentiment expressed
were effectually engraven upon our hearts. Why is it almost universally the case
with men that they are either staggered in their resolution, or buoy themselves
up with confidences, vain, because not derived from God, but just because they
have no apprehension of that salvation which he can extend, which is of itself
sufficient, and without which, any earthly succor is entirely ineffectual? In
contrasting the help of God with that of man, he employs language not strictly
correct, for, in reality, there is no such thing as a power in man to deliver at
all. But, in our ignorance, we conceive as if there were various kinds of help
in the world, and he uses the word in accommodation to our false ideas. God, in
accomplishing our preservation, may use the agency of man, but he reserves it to
himself, as his peculiar prerogative, to deliver, and will not suffer them to
rob him of his glory. The deliverance which comes to us in this manner through
human agency must properly be ascribed to God. All that David meant to assert
is, that such confidences as are not derived from God are worthless and vain.
And to confirm this position, he declares in the last verse of the psalm, that
as, on the one hand, we can do nothing without him, so, on the other, we can do
all things by his help. Two things are implied in the expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>through God we shall do
valiantly</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb401</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> first, that if God withdraw his favor,
any supposed strength which is in man will soon fail; and, on the other hand,
that those whose sufficiency is derived from God only are armed with courage to
overcome every difficulty. To show that it is no mere half credit which he gives
God, he adds, in words which ascribe the whole work to him, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it is he who shall tread down our
enemies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Thus, even in our controversy
with creatures like ourselves, we are not at liberty to share the honor of
success with God; and must it not be accounted greater sacrilege still when men
set free will in opposition to divine grace, and speak of their concurring
equally with God in the matter of procuring eternal salvation? Those who
arrogate the least fraction of strength to themselves apart from God, only ruin
themselves through their own pride.</font><br></div>

61</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This psalm begins with prayer, or, at any rate, with
the brief record of a prayer, which David had preferred to God in a season of
deep distress. It is chiefly occupied, however, with the praises of God,
expressing his thankfulness for a miraculous deliverance which he had
experienced from some imminent danger, and for his establishment upon the
throne.</font><br></div>

God!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is not exactly ascertained at
what time this psalm was composed; but there seems to be some probability in the
conjecture, that David had been for a considerable period in possession of the
throne before he fell into the circumstances of distress which are here
mentioned. I agree with those who refer it to the time of the conspiracy of
Absalom;</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb403</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for, had he not been an exile, he could
not speak, as in the second verse, of crying from the ends of the earth. By
using the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cry</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he would intimate the vehemency of his desire; and it is a word which
expresses inward fervency of spirit, without reference to the fact whether he
may have prayed aloud, or in a low and subdued tone. The repetition which is
employed denotes his diligence and perseverance in prayer, and teaches us that
we should not faint and become discouraged in this exercise, because God may not
have immediately and openly testified his acceptance of our petitions. There can
be no question that, by </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the ends
of the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he refers to the place of
his banishment, as being cut off from access to the temple and the royal city.
By some, indeed, the words have been understood figuratively, as meaning, that
he prayed from the lowest deeps of distress; but I can see no foundation for
this. In a subsequent part of the psalm, he calls himself King, a title never
assumed by him before the death of Saul, and from this circumstance we may at
once infer, that the time referred to was that when he fled in trepidation from
the fury of his son Absalom, and hid himself in the wilderness of Mahanaim, and
places of a similarly solitary description. Mount Zion was the place where the
ark of the covenant had been deposited, and it was the seat of royalty; and
David, when banished from this, which was the principal and most eligible
locality, speaks as if he had been driven to the uttermost parts of the earth.
Living, though he did, under the shadows of a legal dispensation, he did not
cease to pray, because removed to a distance from the temple; and how
inexcusable must our conduct be, privileged as we are of God, and called to draw
near by the way which has been opened through the blood of Christ, if we break
not through every hinderance which Satan presents to our communications with
heaven? Let those who may have been deprived of the hearing of the word, and the
dispensation of the sacraments, so as, in a manner, to be banished out of the
Church, learn from the example of David to persevere in crying to God, even
under these solitary circumstances. He adverts, in what follows, to his grief
and anguish. He adds the fact of his being shut up from every method of escape,
that the grace of God might be made more apparent in his deliverance. The Hebrew
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&atilde;f[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ataph, </i>which I have translated
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>vexed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>means occasionally <i>to cover, </i>or <i>involve, </i>which has led some to
render the clause, <i>while my heart is turned about; </i>that is, tossed hither
and thither, or agitated. This is a harsh translation. Others read with more
propriety, <i>while my heart is involved in cares and troubles, or
overwhelmed.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb404</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I have adopted a simpler
rendering, although I would not be understood as denying the metaphor, to which
they suppose that there is an allusion. The clause, there can be no question, is
inserted to intimate that he was not prevented by trouble from having recourse
to God. Notice was taken already of the outward trial to which he was subjected,
in distance from the sanctuary, and of his rising above this, so as to direct
his cry to God; and in the words before us, we have his confession that he was
far from being stoically insensible, being conscious of a severe inward struggle
with grief and perplexity of mind. It is the duty, then, of believers, when
oppressed with heaviness and spiritual distress, to make only the more strenuous
efforts for breaking through these obstacles in their approaches to God. His
prayer is, that God would bring him to that safety from which he seems to be
excluded. By a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rock</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>or <i>citadel, </i>he means, in general, secure protection, from which he
complains of being shut out, as it was impossible to reach it unless he were
raised by the hand of God. In looking round him, it seemed as if every place of
shelter and safety were lifted up above his head and rendered inaccessible. He
was cut off from all help, and yet, hopeless as deliverance appeared, he had no
doubt of his safety, should God only extend his hand for interposition. This is
the plain meaning of the passage, when divested of figure, that God was able to
rescue him from danger, though all other help should be withdrawn, and the whole
world should stand between him and deliverance; a truth which we would do well
to consider seriously. In looking for deliverance from God, we must beware of
yielding to the suggestions of sense; we should remember that he does not always
work by apparent means, but delivers us when he chooses by methods inscrutable
to reason. If we attempt to prescribe any one particular line of procedure, we
do no less than wilfully limit his almighty
power.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thou hast been my
hope</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here we may suppose, either that
he calls to his remembrance such benefits as he had formerly received, or that
he congratulates himself upon deliverance which he had presently experienced.
There is much probability in either supposition. Nothing animates our hopes more
than the recollection of the past goodness of God, and, in the midst of his
prayers, we frequently find David indulging in reflections of this kind. On the
other hand, the remainder of the psalm is occupied with returning praise to God
for his present goodness; and there is no reason why we should not suppose, that
these words before us form the commencement of the thanksgiving. In that case,
the Hebrew particle, which we have rendered <i>for </i>or <i>because, </i>may be
understood rather in an affirmative sense, <i>surely </i>or
<i>certainly.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino">In the verse which follows, he
expresses the confidence which he had that he would dwell from this time forth
in the sanctuary of the Lord. I cannot altogether agree with those who think
that David was still in his state of exile from his native country when this was
written, and is merely to be understood as promising to himself the certainty of
his return. He would seem rather to be rejoicing in restoration already
obtained, than assuaging his grief by anticipation of it in the future; and this
will be still more apparent, when we come to consider the immediate context. It
is noticeable, that now when he was returned from his banishment, and
established within his own palace, his heart was set more upon the worship of
God than all the wealth, splendor, and pleasures of royalty. We have his
testimony in other parts of his writings, that in the worst calamities which he
endured, he experienced nothing which could be compared to the bitterness of
being shut out from the ordinances of religion; and now he accounts it a higher
pleasure to lie as a suppliant before the altar, than to sit upon the throne of
a king. By the words which immediately follow, he shows that he did not, like
too many uninformed persons, attach a superstitious importance to the mere
externals of religion, adding, that he found his safety
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>under the shadow of God's
wings.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Ignorant persons might conceive
of God as necessarily confined to the outward tabernacle, but David only
improved this symbol of the Divine presence as a means of elevating the
spiritual exercises of his faith. I would not deny that there may be an allusion
to the cherubim when he speaks of the shadow of God's wings. Only we must
remember, that David did not rest in carnal ordinances, the elements of the
world,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb405</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but rose by them and above them to the
spiritual worship of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thou, O God! hast
heard my vows. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He here shows the grounds upon
which he had spoken of his abiding under the wings of God. The sudden joy which
he experienced arose from the circumstance of God's having heard his prayers,
and made light to spring out of darkness. By his <i>vows </i>we must understand
his prayers, according to a common figure of speech by which the part is taken
for the whole, having made vows when he prayed. In general, he would acknowledge
himself indebted for his restoration entirely to an interposition of Divine
power, and not to any dexterity which he had shown in gaining time for the
collection of his forces,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb407</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> nor to any assistance which he had
derived, either from the favor of the priests or the exertions of his soldiers.
Had the letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lamed, </i>been prefixed to the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yary</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
yirey, </i>which is rendered <i>fearing, </i>there would have been no reason
left to doubt that the words which follow were of the nature of a general
assertion, to the effect, that God has given the inheritance to those who fear
him. As it is, they may be construed to mean, that God had given David the
inheritance of those who fear him. Still I prefer attaching the more general
sense to the words, and understand them as intimating that God never disappoints
his servants, but crowns with everlasting happiness the struggles and the
distresses which may have exercised their faith. They convey an implied censure
of that unwarrantable confidence which is indulged in by the wicked, when
favored, through the divine forbearance, with any interval of prosperity. The
success which flatters them is merely imaginary, and speedily vanishes. But
<i>inheritance &#8212; </i>the<i> </i>word here employed by David &#8212;
suggests that the people of God enjoy a species of prosperity more solid and
enduring; their momentary and short-lived troubles having only the effect of
promoting their eternal welfare. He praises God that those who fear his name are
not left to the poor privilege of rejoicing for a few days, but secured in a
permanent heritage of happiness. The truth is one which cannot be questioned.
The wicked, having no possession by faith of the divine benefits which they may
happen to share, live on from day to day, as it were, upon plunder. It is only
such as fear the Lord who have the true and legitimate enjoyment of their
blessings.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>

fb408</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>David cannot be considered as
using these words of gratulation with an exclusive reference to himself. It is
true that he lived to an extreme old age, and died full of days, leaving the
kingdom in a settled condition, and in the hands of his son, who succeeded him;
but he did not exceed the period of one man's life, and the greater part of it
was spent in continued dangers and anxieties. There can be no doubt, therefore,
that the series of years, and even ages, of which he speaks, extends
prospectively to the coming of Christ, it being the very condition of the
kingdom, as I have often remarked, that God maintained them as one people under
one head, or, when scattered, united them again. The same succession still
subsists in reference to ourselves. Christ must be viewed as living in his
members to the end of the world. To this Isaiah alludes, when he says, "Who
shall declare his generation or age?" &#8212; words in which he predicts that
the Church would survive through all ages, notwithstanding the incessant danger
of destruction to which it is exposed through the attacks of its enemies, and
the many storms assailing it. So here David foretells the uninterrupted
succession of the kingdom down to the time of
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He shall abide before the
face of God for ever. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This is only a simpler
way of expressing what he had said before, <i>I</i> <i>will abide in thy
tabernacle for ever</i>. He refers to the security and peace which he would
enjoy under the protection of God, who would effectually preserve his life. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the face of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>must be meant the fatherly care and
providence which he extends to his people. So numerous are the dangers which
surround us, that we could not stand a single moment, if his eye did not watch
over our preservation. But the true security for a happy life lies in being
persuaded that we are under divine government. There follows a prayer that God
would <i>appoint mercy and truth </i>for preserving the king. And this admits of
two meanings. As clemency and truth are the best safeguards of a kingdom, it
would not be altogether unreasonable to suppose that David prays here to be
endued with these dispositions, as a means of establishing his throne. But the
other meaning is perhaps preferable, that God would gird himself with clemency
and truth in order to the preservation of the king. The Hebrew term
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>manah, </i>signifies not only <i>to
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prepare</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>but <i>to set over, </i>or <i>appoint; </i>and he speaks as if the true
defense of the kingdom was only to be found in the mercy and faithfulness of
God. He uses the expression
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prepare</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>or <i>command, </i>to intimate how easily God can provide the means
necessary for preserving his people. In the concluding words, he expresses his
resolution to persevere in the constant celebration of the praises of God, with
a view to fulfilling the vows which he had contracted &#8212; and this again may
lead us to remark the agreement which ought ever to subsist between the two
parts of invocation: for David, while he applied to God for help, under the
pressure of calamity, showed himself uniformly grateful when he had experienced
deliverance.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">PSALM
62</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The greater part of this psalm is occupied with
meditations, in which David encourages himself and others to hope in God, and
fortifies his mind against the assaults of temptation. And as we are ever prone
to be drawn away from God by the influence which worldly objects exert over our
senses, perishing and evanescent as these are, occasion is taken to show the
folly of this, and bring us to a single and entire dependence upon
God.</font><br></div>

sufficiently probable that the allusion is to some musician of that family. But
this would not seem to be the case here; for the psalm is not said to be given
<i>to, </i>but <i>upon </i>Jeduthun. This has led to the opinion that it formed
the beginning of some song commonly known at that time. Still the Hebrew
particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>al, </i>which we have rendered <i>upon, </i>means frequently <i>for, to,

translation I have followed be adopted, the psalm is to be considered as
beginning abruptly, in the usual style of compositions of an impassioned
kind.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb410</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Of this we have an instance in Psalm
73, where the prophet, who had been agitated with doubts, as we shall see more
particularly afterwards, suddenly brings his mind to a fixed decision, and, in
the way of cutting off all further subject of debate, exclaims, "Yet<i> </i>God
is good to Israel." And so it is, I conceive, in the psalm before us. We know
that the Lord's people cannot always reach such a measure of composure as to be
wholly exempt from distraction. They would wish to receive the word of the Lord
with submission, and to be dumb under his correcting hand; but inordinate
affections will take possession of their minds, and break in upon that peace
which they might otherwise attain to in the exercise of faith and resignation.
Hence the impatience we find in many; an impatience which they give vent to in
the presence of God, and which is an occasion to themselves of much trouble and
disquietude. The Hebrew particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#176;a</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
ach, </i>is often used in an exclusive sense, and has been rendered by some,
<i>only; </i>it is also employed in an affirmative sense, and has been rendered
<i>truly, </i>or <i>certainly. </i>But in order to arrive at its full meaning,
we must suppose that David felt an inward struggle and opposition, which he
found it necessary to check. Satan had raised a tumult in his affections, and
wrought a degree of impatience in his mind, which he now curbs; and he expresses
his resolution <i>to be silent.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb411</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The word implies a meek and
submissive endurance of the cross. It expresses the opposite of that heat of
spirit which would put us into a posture of resistance to God. The silence
intended is, in short, that composed submission of the believer, in the exercise
of which he acquiesces in the promises of God, gives place to his word, bows to
his sovereignty, and suppresses every inward murmur of dissatisfaction. The
Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hymwd</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
dumiyah, </i>which I have rendered <i>is silent, </i>some consider to be the
noun; and it is of little consequence which translation we
adopt.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#176;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ach, </i>in the second verse, I would render in the same way as in the first.
The believer triumphs in one encounter with temptation only to enter upon
another; and here David, who appeared to have emerged from his distress, shows
that he had still to struggle with remaining difficulties. We meet with the same
particle no fewer than six times throughout the psalm. This, too, may explain
the many titles which he applies to God, each of which is to be considered as a
foil by which he would ward off the attacks of the tempter. The expression in
the close of the verse, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I shall
not be greatly moved</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>implies his
persuasion that he might be overtaken with afflictions, (for he was well aware
that he could claim no exemption from the common lot of humanity,) but his
conviction, at the same time, that these would not overwhelm him, through the
good help of God. We shall find him saying afterwards, in so many words,
<i>I</i> <i>shall not fall; </i>perhaps because he felt, as he advanced in
prayer, that he had greater boldness in despising affliction. Or the expressions
may be taken as synonymous in the two places. The truth itself is
unquestionable. The believer may be overthrown for a time; but as he is no
sooner cast down than he is raised up again by God, he cannot properly be said
to fall. He is supported by the Spirit of God, and is not therefore really
prostrated and overcome.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

ye meditate evil against a man, and persist in mischievous devices for
accomplishing his ruin? He has in view the obstinate malice of his enemies,
moving every stone for his destruction, and forming new plans daily for
effecting it. The instruction to be learned from his experience is, that we
should exercise patience, even when our enemies show unwearied cruelty in their
attempts to destroy us, and are instigated by the devil to incessant artifices
for our persecution. We may just advert to the meaning of the figure which is
subjoined. Some think that the wicked are compared to a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bowing

to fall to the ground, and they, upon every sin which they commit, tend more and
more downwards, till they are precipitated into destruction. But it would seem
as if the allusion were somewhat different. A wall, when ill built, bulges out
in the center, presenting the appearance of nearly twice its actual breadth;
but, as it is hollow within, it soon falls to ruins. The wicked, in like manner,
are dilated with pride, and assume, in their consultations, a most formidable
appearance; but David predicts that they would be brought to unexpected and
utter destruction, like a wall badly constructed, and hollow in the interior,
which falls with a sudden crash, and is broken by its own weight into a thousand
pieces.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

determining to rest steadfastly upon the promise of divine favor; but, upon the
other, he had before him the machinations of his enemies, characterised by
cruelty, audacity, pride, and deceit. By all their attempts, as if he had said,
they do nothing but precipitate their own fall; still such are the frenzy and
the fury by which they are actuated, that they persist in their intrigues
against me. He insinuates that their attacks were directed, not so much against
himself as against God &#8212; agreeably to the picture which is given us of
impiety by the poets in their fable of the

speaking here of himself in the third person, but of himself as elevated

the party directly intended, the scope of the words rather intimates that they
aimed at the overthrow of one whom God had exalted, and desired to establish in
honor. In thus attempting to thwart his purpose, they were really fighting
against God. The clause which follows,

Refusing to acknowledge his divine vocation, they persevered in following such

to be a slight inconsistency, inasmuch as he encourages himself to do what he
had already declared himself to have done. His soul was silent before God; and
where the necessity of this new silence, as if still under agitation of spirit?
Here it is to be remembered, that our minds can never be expected to reach such
perfect composure as shall preclude every inward feeling of disquietude, but
are, at the best, as the sea before a light breeze, fluctuating sensibly, though
not swollen into billows. It is not without a struggle that the saint can
compose his mind; and we can very well understand how David should enjoin more
perfect submission upon a spirit which was already submissive, urging upon
himself farther advancement in this grace of silence, till he had mortified
every carnal inclination, and thoroughly subjected himself to the will of God.
How often, besides, will Satan renew the disquietudes which seemed to be
effectually expelled? Creatures of such instability, and liable to be borne away
by a thousand different influences, we need to be confirmed again and again. I
repeat, that there is no reason to be surprised though David here calls upon
himself a second time to preserve that silence before God, which he might
already appear to have attained; for, amidst the disturbing motions of the
flesh, perfect composure is what we never reach. The danger is, that when new
winds of troubles spring up, we lose that inward tranquillity which we enjoyed,
and hence the necessity of improving the example of David, by establishing
ourselves in it more and more. He adds the ground of his silence. He had no
immediate response from God, but he confidently hoped in him. <i>My expectation,
</i>he says, <i>is from God. </i>Never, as if he had said, will he frustrate the
patient waiting of his saints; doubtless my silence shall meet with its reward;
I shall restrain myself, and not make that false haste which will only retard my

expression is here heaped upon another and this apparently because he wished to
rein that infirmity of disposition which makes us so prone to slide into wrong
exercise. We may throw out a passing and occasional acknowledgement, that our
only help is to be found in God, and yet shortly display our distrust in him by
busying ourselves in all directions to supplement what we consider defective in
his aid. The various terms which he employs to express the sufficiency of God as
a deliverer, may thus be considered as so many arguments to constancy, or so
many checks which he would apply to the waywardness of the carnal heart, ever
disposed to depend for support upon others rather than God. Such is the manner
in which he animates his own spirit; and next, we find him addressing himself to
others, calling upon them to enter upon the same conflict, and reap the same
victory and triumph. By the <i>people, </i>there seems little doubt that he
means the Jews. The Gentiles being yet unvisited by the true religion and divine
revelation, it was only in Judea that God could be the object of trust and
religious invocation; and it would appear, that by distinguishing the chosen
people of the Lord from the surrounding heathen, he insinuates how disgraceful
it would be in them not to devote themselves entirely to God, being, as they
were, the children of Abraham, favored with the discovery of his grace, and
specially taken under his divine protection. The expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>at all
times</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>means both in prosperity and
adversity, intimating the blameworthiness of those who waver and succumb under
every variation in their outward circumstances. God tries his children with
afflictions, but here they are taught by David to abide them with constancy and
courage. The hypocrites, who are loud in their praises of God so long as
prosperity shines upon their head, while their heart fails them upon the first
approach of trial, dishonor his name by placing a most injurious limitation to
his power. We are bound to put honor upon his name by remembering, in our
greatest extremities, that to Him belong the issues of death. And as we are all
too apt at such times to shut up our affliction in our own breast &#8212; a
circumstance which can only aggravate the trouble and imbitter the mind against
God, David could not have suggested a better expedient than that of disburdening
our cares to him, and thus, as it were,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pouring out our hearts before
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is always found, that when the
heart is pressed under a load of distress, there is no freedom in
prayer.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb420</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Under trying circumstances, we must
comfort ourselves by reflecting that God will extend relief, provided we just
freely roll them over upon his consideration. What the Psalmist advises is all
the more necessary, considering the mischievous tendency which we have naturally
to keep our troubles pent up in our breasts till they drive us to despair.
Usually, indeed, men show much anxiety and ingenuity in seeking to escape from
the troubles which may happen to press upon them; but so long as they shun
coming into the presence of God, they only involve themselves in a labyrinth of
difficulties. Not to insist farther upon the words, David is here to be
considered as exposing that diseased but deeply-rooted principle in our nature,
which leads us to hide our griefs, and ruminate upon them, instead of relieving
ourselves at once by pouring out our prayers and complaints before God. The
consequence is, that we are distracted more and more with our distresses, and
merge into a state of hopeless despondency. In the close of the verse, he says,
in reference to the people generally, what he had said of himself individually,
that their safety was to be found only under the divine
protection.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.<i>

<i>ach, </i>affirmatively, as meaning <i>surely </i>or <i>certainly, </i>then
this verse contains a confirmation of the truth expressed in the preceding
verse; and David argues by contrast,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb421</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that as men are lighter than vanity, we
are shut up to the necessity of placing all our expectation upon God. It would
agree well, however, with the contrast to suppose, that, under an impression of
the little effect which the truth he had announced was calculated to have upon
the people, (ever disposed to build upon fallacious hopes,) he exclaims, with a
degree of holy fervor, <i>Nevertheless, etc. </i>According to this view, he is
here administering a reproof to the blind infidelity so prevalent amongst men,
and which leads them to deceive themselves with lying vanities rather than trust
in the infallible promises of Jehovah. Having had occasion to discover such a
large amount of vanity in the chosen seed of Abraham, he does not scruple to
speak of the whole human family in general as being abandoned to lying
delusions. The adverb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">djy</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
yachad, together, </i>intimates that all, without exception, are ready to find
an occasion of turning aside. Such is the sweeping condemnation passed, not upon
a few individuals, but upon human nature, declaring men to be lighter than
vanity; and may we not ask what in this case becomes of boasted reason, wisdom,
and free-will? It is of no avail to object, that believers are delivered from
the deceit which is here condemned. If they owe their exemption from lying and
vanity to the regeneration of the Spirit, this is to grant that they were
subject to these in their natural state. The first man was created by God
upright, but drew us by his fall into such a depth of corruption, that any light
which was originally bestowed has been totally obscured. Is it alleged that
there still remain in man such gifts of God as are not to be despised, and as
distinguish him from all the other creatures, this is easily answered, by
remembering, that however great these may be, he is tainted by sin, and
therefore nothing to be accounted of. It is only when allied with the knowledge
of God that any of the endowments conferred upon us from above can be said to
have a real excellency; &#8212; apart from this, they are vitiated by that
contagion of sin which has not left a vestige in man of his original integrity.
With too much justice, then, might David say that all men are vanity and
nothingness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10<i>.</i>
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Trust not in oppression and
robbery</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We are here taught that there
can be no real trusting in God until we put away all those vain confidences
which prove so many means of turning us away from him. The Psalmist bids us
remove whatsoever would have this tendency, and purge ourselves of every vicious
desire that would usurp the place of God in our hearts. One or two kinds of sin
only are mentioned, but these are to be understood as representing a part for
the whole, all those vain and rival confidences of which we must be divested
before we can cleave to God with true purpose and sincerity of heart. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>oppression and
robbery</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>may be understood the act itself
of abstracting by violence, and the thing which has been abstracted. It is
obviously the design of the passage to warn us against the presumption and
hardihood of sin, which is so apt to blind the hearts of men, and deceive them
into the belief that their evil courses are sanctioned by the impunity which is
extended to them. Interpreters have differed in their construction of the words
of this verse. Some join to each of the nouns its own verb, reading, <i>Trust
not in oppression, and be not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your
heart upon them.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb422</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Others connect the words
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>oppression and
robbery</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>with the first verb, and make
the second to stand apart by itself in an indefinite sense. It is of very little
consequence which of the constructions we adopt, since both express the main
sentiment; and it is evident that the Psalmist, in condemning the infatuated
confidence of those who boast in robbery, appropriately terms it a mere illusion
of the mind, with which they deceive or amuse themselves. Having denounced, in
the first place, those desires which are plainly evil and positively wicked, he
proceeds immediately afterwards to guard against an inordinate attachment even
to such riches as may have been honestly acquired. To
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>set the
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>upon riches, means more than
simply to covet the possession of them. It implies being carried away by them
into a false confidence, or, to use an expression of Paul, "Being high-minded."
The admonition here given is one which daily observation teaches us to be
necessary. It is uniformly seen that prosperity and abundance engender a haughty
spirit, leading men at once to be presumptuous in their carriage before God, and
reckless in inflicting injury upon their fellow-creatures. But, indeed, the
worst effect to be feared from a blind and ungoverned spirit of this kind is,
that, in the intoxication of outward greatness, we be left to forget how frail
we are, and proudly and contumeliously to exalt ourselves against
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

only effectual method of abstracting the minds of men from the vain delusions in
which they are disposed to trust, was bringing them to acquiesce implicitly and

surer principle for the regulation of their conduct, when he recommends a

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;540616&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 6:16;) and as none can come to him except by faith, the Psalmist calls
our attention to his word, in which he testifies the truth of his divine and
righteous government of the world. It is of great consequence that we be
established in the belief of God's Word, and we are here directed to the
unerring certainty which belongs to it. The passage admits of two
interpretations; but the scope of it is plainly this, that God acts consistently
with himself, and can never swerve from what he has said. Many understand David
to say that God had spoken once and a second time; and that by this explicit and
repeated assertion of his power and mercy, he had confirmed the truth beyond all
possibility of contradiction. There is a passage much to the same effect in the
thirty-third chapter of the book of Job, and fourteenth verse, where the same
words are used, only the copulative is interposed. If any should prefer it,
however, I have no objections to the other meaning &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God has spoken once; twice have I
heard this.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It agrees with the context,
and suggests a practical lesson of great importance; for when God has once
issued his word he never retracts: on the other hand, it is our duty to ponder
on what he has said, long and deliberately; and the meaning of David will then
be, that he considered the Word of God in the light of a decree, steadfast and
irreversible, but that, as regarded his exercise in reference to it, he
meditated upon it again and again, lest the lapse of time might obliterate it
from his memory. But the simpler and preferable reading would seem to be, that
God had spoken once and again. There is no force in the ingenious conjecture,
that allusion may be made to God's having spoken once in the Law, and a second
time in the Prophets. Nothing more is meant than that the truth referred to had
been amply confirmed, it being usual to reckon anything certain and fixed which
has been repeatedly announced. Here, however, it must be remembered, that every
word which may have issued forth from God is to be received with implicit
authority, and no countenance given to the abominable practice of refusing to
receive a doctrine, unless it can be supported by two or three texts of
Scripture. This has been defended by an unprincipled heretic among ourselves,
who has attempted to subvert the doctrine of a free election, and of a secret
providence. It was not the intention of David to say that God was tied down to
the necessity of repeating what he might choose to announce, but simply to
assert the certainty of a truth which had been declared in clear and unambiguous
terms. In the context which follows, he exemplifies himself that deferential
reverence and regard for the word of God which all should, but which so few
actually do, extend to it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We might just put
together, in a connected form, the particular doctrines which he has singled out
for special notice. It is essentially necessary, if we would fortify our minds
against temptation, to have suitably exalted views of the power and mercy of
God, since nothing will more effectually preserve us in a straight and
undeviating course, than a firm persuasion that all events are in the hand of
God, and that he is as merciful as he is mighty. Accordingly, David follows up
what he had said on the subject of the deference to be yielded to the word, by
declaring that he had been instructed by it in the power and goodness of God.
Some understand him to say, that God is possessed of power to deliver his
people, and of clemency imbuing him to exercise it. But he would rather appear
to mean, that God is strong to put a restraint upon the wicked, and crush their
proud and nefarious designs, but ever mindful of his goodness in protecting and
defending his own children. The man who disciplines himself to the contemplation
of these two attributes, which ought never to be dissociated in our minds from
the idea of God, is certain to stand erect and immovable under the fiercest
assaults of temptation; while, on the other hand, by losing sight of the
all-sufficiency of God, (which we are too apt to do,) we lay ourselves open to
be overwhelmed in the first encounter. The world's opinion of God is, that he
sits in heaven an idle and unconcerned spectator of events which are passing.
Need we wonder, that men tremble under every casualty, when they thus believe
themselves to be the sport of blind chance? There can be no security felt unless
we satisfy ourselves of the truth of a divine superintendence, and can commit
our lives and all that we have to the hands of God. The first thing which we
must look to is his power, that we may have a thorough conviction of his being a
sure refuge to such as cast themselves upon his care. With this there must be
conjoined confidence in his mercy, to prevent those anxious thoughts which might
otherwise rise in our minds. These may suggest the doubt &#8212; What though God
govern the world? does it follow that he will concern himself about such
unworthy objects as ourselves?</font><br><font face="Palatino">There is an
obvious reason, then, for the Psalmist coupling these two things together, his
power and his clemency. They are the two wings wherewith we fly upwards to
heaven; the two pillars on which we rest, and may defy the surges of temptation.
Does danger, in short, spring up from any quarter, then just let us call to
remembrance that divine power which can bid away all harms, and as this
sentiment prevails in our minds, our troubles cannot fail to fall prostrate
before it. Why should we fear &#8212; how can we be afraid, when the God who
covers us with the shadow of his wings, is the same who rules the universe with
his nod, holds in secret chains the devil and all the wicked, and effectually
overrules their designs and intrigues?</font><br><font face="Palatino">The
Psalmist adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou wilt
certainly render to every man according to his
work.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>And here he brings what he said to
bear still more closely upon the point which he would establish, declaring that
the God who governs the world by his providence will judge it in righteousness.
The expectation of this, duly cherished, will have a happy effect in composing
our minds, allaying impatience, and checking any disposition to resent and
retaliate under our injuries. In resting himself and others before the great bar
of God, he would both encourage his heart in the hope of that deliverance which
was coming, and teach himself to despise the insolent persecution of his
enemies, when he considered that every man's work was to come into judgment
before Him, who can no more cease to be Judge than deny himself. We can
therefore rest assured, however severe our wrongs may be, though wicked men
should account us the filth and the off-scourings of all things, that God is
witness to what we suffer, will interpose in due time, and will not disappoint
our patient expectation. From this, and passages of a similar kind, the Papists
have argued, in defense of their doctrine, that justification and salvation
depend upon good works; but I have already exposed the fallacy of their
reasoning. No sooner is mention made of works, than they catch at the
expression, as amounting to a statement that God rewards men upon the ground of
merit. It is with a very different design than to encourage any such opinion,
that the Spirit promises a reward to our works &#8212; it is to animate us in
the ways of obedience, and not to inflame that impious self-confidence which
cuts up salvation by the very roots. According to the judgment which God forms
of the works of the believer, their worth and valuation depend, first, upon the
free pardon extended to him as a sinner, and by which he becomes reconciled to
God; and, next, upon the divine condescension and indulgence which accepts his
services,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb424</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> notwithstanding all their
imperfections. We know that there is none of our works which, in the sight of
God, can be accounted perfect or pure, and without taint of sin. Any recompense
they meet with must therefore be traced entirely to his goodness. Since the
Scriptures promise a reward to the saints, with the sole intention of
stimulating their minds, and encouraging them in the divine warfare, and not
with the remotest design of derogating from the mercy of God, it is absurd in
the Papists to allege that they, in any sense, merit what is bestowed upon them.
As regards the wicked, none will dispute that the punishment awarded to them, as
violators of the law, is strictly deserved.</font><br></div>

title, can be no other than that of Ziph, where David wandered so long in a
state of concealment. We may rely upon the truth of the record he gives us of
his exercise when under his trials; and it is apparent that he never allowed
himself to be so far overcome by them, as to cease lifting up his prayers to
heaven, and even resting, with a firm and constant faith, upon the divine
promises. Apt as we are, when assaulted by the very slightest trials, to lose
the comfort of any knowledge of God we may previously have possessed, it is
necessary that we should notice this, and learn, by his example, to struggle to
maintain our confidence under the worst troubles that can befall us. He does
more than simply pray; he sets the Lord before him as his God, that he may throw
all his cares unhesitatingly upon him, deserted as he was of man, and a poor
outcast in the waste and howling wilderness. His faith, shown in this persuasion
of the favor and help of God, had the effect of exciting him to constant and
vehement prayer for the grace which he expected. In saying that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his soul thirsted, and his flesh
longed,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he alludes to the destitution
and poverty which he lay under in the wilderness, and intimates, that though
deprived of the ordinary means of subsistence, he looked to God as his meat and
his drink, directing all his desires to him. When he represents his soul as
thirsting, and his flesh as hungering, we are not to seek for any nice or
subtile design in the distinction. He means simply that he desired God, both
with soul and body. For although the body, strictly speaking, is not of itself
influenced by desire, we know that the feelings of the soul intimately and
extensively affect it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.<i>

as already hinted, that God was ever in his thoughts, though wandering in the
wilderness under such circumstances of destitution. The particle
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is emphatic. Even when so situated, in a wild and hideous solitude, where
the very horrors of the place were enough to have distracted his meditations, he
exercised himself in beholding the power and glory of God, just as if he had
been in the sanctuary. Formerly, when it was in his power to wait upon the
tabernacle, he was far from neglecting that part of the instituted worship of
God. He was well aware that he needed such helps to devotion. But now, when shut
out, in the providence of God, from any such privilege, he shows, by the delight
which he took in spiritual views of God, that his was not a mind engrossed with
the symbols, or mere outward ceremonial of religion. He gives evidence how much
he had profited by the devotional exercises enjoined under that dispensation. It
is noticeable of ignorant and superstitious persons, that they seem full of zeal
and fervor so long as they come in contact with the ceremonies of religion,
while their seriousness evaporates immediately upon these being withdrawn.
David, on the contrary, when these were removed, continued to retain them in his
recollection, and rise, through their assistance, to fervent aspirations after
God. We may learn by this, when deprived at any time of the outward means of
grace, to direct the eye of our faith to God in the worst circumstances, and not
to forget him whenever the symbols of holy things are taken out of our sight.
The great truth, for example, of our spiritual regeneration, though but once
represented to us in baptism, should remain fixed in our minds through our whole
life,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

matter of reflection, not only when we sit at the Lord's table, but at all other
times. Or suppose that the Lord's Supper, and other means of advancing our
spiritual welfare, were taken from us by an exercise of tyrannical power, it
does not follow that our minds should ever cease to be occupied with the
contemplation of God. The expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So have I beheld thee to
see</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc., indicates the earnestness
with which he was intent upon the object, directing his whole meditation to
this, that he might see the power and glory of God, of which there was a
reflection in the sanctuary.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because thy mercy is
better than life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc.</i> I have no
objections to read the verse in this connected form, though I think that the
first clause would be better separated, and taken in with the verse preceding.
David would appear to be giving the reason of his earnestness in desiring God.
By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is to be understood, in general, everything which men use for their own
maintenance and defense. When we think ourselves well provided otherwise, we
feel no disposition to have recourse to the mercy of God. That <i>being </i>(to
speak so) which we have of our own, prevents us from seeing that we live through
the mere grace of God.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb429</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> As we are too much disposed to trust in
aids of a carnal kind, and to forget God, the Psalmist here affirms that we
should have more reliance upon the divine mercy in the midst of death, than upon
what we are disposed to call, or what may appear to be, life. Another
interpretation has been given of the words of this verse, but a very meagre and
feeble one, &#8212; That the mercy of God is better than life itself; or, in
other words, that the divine favor is preferable to every other possession. But
the opposition is evidently between that state of secure prosperity, in which
men are so apt to rest with complacency, and the mercy of God, which is the stay
of such as are ready to sink and perish, and which is the one effectual remedy
for supplying (if one might use that expression) all
defects.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The word which I have rendered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>being in the plural number in the Hebrew, has led Augustine to assign a
meaning to the sentence which is philosophical and ingenious, but without
foundation, as the plural of the word is quite commonly used in the singular
signification. He considered that the term <i>lives </i>was here used in
reference to the truth, That different men affect different modes of life, some
seeking riches, and others pleasure; some desiring the luxuries, and some the
honors of this world, while others are given to their sensual appetites. He
conceived that there was an opposition stated in the verse between these various
kinds of life and eternal life, here by a common figure of speech called
<i>mercy, </i>because it is of grace, and not of merit. But it is much more
natural to understand the Psalmist as meaning, that it was of no consequence how
large a share men possess of prosperity, and of the means which are generally
thought to make life secure, the divine mercy being a better foundation of trust
than any life fashioned out to ourselves, and than all other supports taken
together.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb430</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> On this account the Lord's people,
however severely they may suffer from poverty, or the violence of human wrongs,
or the languor of desire, or hunger and thirst, or the many troubles and
anxieties of life, may be happy notwithstanding; for it is well with them, in
the best sense of the term, when God is their friend. Unbelievers, on the other
hand, must be miserable, even when all the world smiles upon them; for God is
their enemy, and a curse necessarily attaches to their
lot.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the words which follow, David expresses
his consequent resolution to praise God. When we experience his goodness, we are
led to open our lips in thanksgiving. His intention is intimated still more
clearly in the succeeding verse, where he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he will bless God in his
life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There is some difficulty, however,
in ascertaining the exact sense of the words. When it is said, So <i>will I
bless thee, </i>etc., the <i>so </i>may refer to the good reason which he had,
as just stated, to praise God, from having felt how much better it is to live by
life communicated from God, than to live of and from
ourselves.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon"> fb431
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Or the sense may be, <i>so, </i>that is,
<i>even in this calamitous and afflicted condition: </i>for he had already
intimated that, amidst the solitude of the wilderness, where he wandered, he
would still direct his eye to God. The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>again, may refer to his life as having been preserved by divine
interposition; or the sense of the passage may be, that he would bless God
<i>through the course of his life. </i>The former meaning conveys the fullest
matter of instruction, and agrees with the context; he would bless God, because,
by his goodness, he had been kept alive and in safety. The sentiment is similar
to that which we find elsewhere,</font><br></div>

goodness, while it stirs us up to gratitude, should, at the same time,
strengthen our hopes of the future, and lead us confidently to expect that God
will perfect the grace which he has begun. Some understand by the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lifting up of his
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that he refers to praising the
Lord. Others, that he speaks of encouraging himself from the divine assistance,
and boldly encountering his enemies. But I prefer the interpretation which has
been already given.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i></b><i>My soul shall be satisfied as with
marrow</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc. </i>In accordance with what was
said in the foregoing verse, David expresses his assured persuasion of obtaining
a rich and abundant measure of every blessing that could call for thanksgiving
and praise. At the period of composing this psalm, he may have been already in
the enjoyment of ease and plenty; but there is reason to believe that he
cherished the persuasion referred to, even when wandering in the wilderness in a
state of poverty and destitution. If we would evidence a strong faith, we must
anticipate the divine favor before it has been actually manifested, and when
there is no present appearance of its forthcoming. From the instance here set
before us, we must learn to be on our guard against despondency, in
circumstances when we may see the wicked wallowing and rioting in the abundance
of the things of this world, while we ourselves are left to pine under the want
of them. David, in the present pressure to which he was exposed, might have
given way to despair, but he knew that God was able to fill the hungry soul, and
that he could want for nothing so long as he possessed an interest in his favor.
It is God's will to try our patience in this life, by afflictions of various
kinds. Let us bear the wrongs which may be done us with meekness, till the time
come when all our desires shall be abundantly satisfied. It may be proper to
observe, that David, when he speaks in figurative language of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>being filled with marrow and
fatness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>does not contemplate that
intemperate and excessive indulgence to which ungodly men surrender themselves,
and by which they brutify their minds. He looks forward to that moderate measure
of enjoyment which would only quicken him to more alacrity in the praises of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I shall surely remember
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc. </i>It may be read also, when,
or, as often as </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I remember thee,
I will pray in the night watches.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>But as
the Hebrew particle here used is occasionally taken for an adverb of
affirmation, as well as of time, I have adhered to the commonly received
translation, In this case, his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>remembering</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>God is to be understood as the same thing with his meditating upon him; and
the one clause contains just a repetition of the sentiment expressed in the
other. If the particle be taken in the different sense formerly mentioned, the
words intimate, that as often as the name of God recurred to his mind, he would
dwell upon it with pleasure, and speak of his goodness. He particularly mentions
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the night
watches</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as, when retired from the sight
of our fellow-creatures, we not only revert to what may have given us anxiety,
but feel our thoughts drawn out more freely to different subjects. We have next
the reason assigned for the engagement or declaration he has just made, which
is, that he owed to God his preservation. The experience of the divine goodness
should dispose us to prayer as well as praise. "I will come into thy house,"
says the Psalmist in another place, "in the multitude of thy mercy,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;190507&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
5:7.) The second part of the seventh verse is expressive of the lively hope with
which he was animated. He was resolved to rejoice and triumph under the shadow
of God's wings, as feeling the same peace and satisfaction in reliance upon his
protection as he could have done had no danger
existed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My soul has cleaved hard
after thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Hebrew verb means also
<i>to apprehend, </i>or <i>follow, </i>especially when in construction with the
preposition which is here joined to it, and therefore we might very properly
render the words, &#8212; <i>My soul shall press or follow after
thee.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb435</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>But even should the other
translation be retained, the sense is, that David's heart was devoted to God
with steadfast perseverance. The phrase,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>after
thee,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is emphatical, and denotes that he
would follow with unwearied constancy, long as the way might be, and full of
hardships, and beset with obstacles, and however sovereignly God might himself
seem to withdraw his presence. The latter clause of the verse may be taken as
referring simply to the deliverance which he had previously mentioned as having
been received. He had good reason to persevere, without fainting, in following
after God, when he considered that he had been preserved in safety, up to this
time, by the divine hand. But I would understand the words as having a more
extensive application, and consider that David here speaks of the grace of
perseverance, which would be bestowed upon him by the Spirit. To say that he
would cleave to God, with an unwavering purpose, at all hazards, might have
sounded like the language of vain boasting, had he not qualified the assertion
by adding, that he would do this in so far as he was sustained by the hand of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

</i>Here we find David rising to a more assured confidence, and triumphing as if
he had already obtained the victory. And there is every reason to believe, that
though he had escaped his difficulties, and was in circumstances of peace and
prosperity when he wrote this psalm, yet he only expresses what he actually felt
at the critical period when his life was in such imminent danger. He declares
his conviction that the enemies who eagerly sought his life would be cut off;
that God would cast them headlong into destruction; and that their very bodies
should be left without burial. To be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the portion of
foxes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb438</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is the same thing with being
left to be torn and devoured by the <i>beasts of the field. </i>It is often
denounced as one judgment which should befall the wicked, that they would perish
by the sword, and become the prey of wolves and of dogs, without privilege of
sepulture. This is a fate which the best of men have met with in the world,
&#8212; for good as well as bad are exposed to the stroke of temporal evil;
&#8212; but there is this distinction, that God watches over the scattered dust
of his own children, gathers it again, and will suffer nothing of them to
perish, whereas, when the wicked are slain, and their bones spread on the field,
this is only preparatory to their everlasting
destruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the king will rejoice in
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The deliverance which David
received had not been extended to him as a private person, but the welfare of
the whole Church was concerned in it, as that of the body in the safety of the
head, and there is therefore a propriety in his representing all the people of
God as rejoicing with him. Nor can we fail to admire his holy magnanimity in not
scrupling to call himself king, overwhelming as the dangers were by which he was
surrounded, because he laid claim to that honor by faith, though yet denied him
in actual possession. In saying that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he would rejoice in
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he refers to the gratitude which he
would feel; at the same time, in extolling the divine goodness shown to him, he
views it as it affected the common body of the
faithful.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb439</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> As was already remarked, the safety of
God's chosen people, at that time, was inseparably connected with the reign of
David and its prosperity &#8212; a figure by which it was the divine intention
to teach us, that our happiness and glory depend entirely upon Christ. By those
who <i>swear in the name of the Lord, </i>he means in general all his genuine
servants. The act of solemnly calling upon God to witness and judge what we say,
is one part of divine worship: hence an oath, by the figure of speech called
synecdoche, is made to signify the profession of religion in general. We are not
to imagine from this that God reckons all those to be his servants who make
mention of his name. Many take it into their lips only to profane it by the
grossest perjury; others outrage or slight it by entering into trifling and
unnecessary oaths; and hypocrites are chargeable with wickedly abusing it. But
those whom David refers to are such as swear by the Lord, considerately and with
reverence, and whose hearts respond to what they declare. This appears more
clearly from the contrast which follows in the verse, where he opposes those who
swear by the name of God to those <i>who speak lies, </i>understanding by that
term, not only treacherous and deceitful men, but men who profane the name of
God by falsehoods of a sacrilegious kind.</font><br></div>

earnestly, and with vehemence, stating, at the same time, what rendered this
necessary. The voice is heard in prayer, proportionally to the earnestness and
ardor which we feel. He condescends upon the circumstances of distress in which
he was presently placed, and takes notice of the dangers to which his life was
exposed from enemies, with other points fitted to excite the favorable
consideration of God. His praying that God would protect his life, proves that
it must have been in danger at this time. In the second verse, he intimates that
his enemies were numerous; and that, without divine assistance, he would be
unable to sustain their attacks. Some difficulty attaches to the words, from
their being susceptible of two meanings. The Hebrew term
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dws</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
sod, </i>which signifies <i>a secret, </i>is understood by some to refer here to
the secret plots of the wicked, and by others, to denote their meeting together
for consultation. In translating it, I have employed a word which admits of
either interpretation. The term
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">t&ccedil;gr</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
rigshath, </i>used in the second part of the verse, may also be rendered in two
ways, as meaning either an <i>assembly </i>of men, or <i>noise </i>and
<i>uproar. </i>It comes from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;gr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ragash, </i>a root signifying <i>to make a tumult. </i>This would suggest
that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dws</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
sod, </i>in the former clause, might refer to the clandestine plots of the
wicked, and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">t&ccedil;gr</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rigshath, </i>in the latter, to their open violence; and that David prayed to
be protected, on the one hand, from the malicious purposes of his enemies, and,
on the other, from the forcible measures by which they proceeded to put them
into execution. But the meaning first given, and which I have adopted, seems the
most simple and natural, That he solicits the compassion of God, by complaining
of the number that were banded against him. Still his language implies that he
looked upon the protection of heaven as amply sufficient against the greatest
combination of adversaries. I may add, that there is an implied plea for
strengthening his cause in prayer, in what he says of the malice and wickedness
of those who were opposed to him; for the more cruel and unjust the conduct of
our enemies may be, we have proportionally the better ground to believe that God
will interpose in our
behalf.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3<i>.</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>For they have whetted their tongue like a
sword</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>His enemies, in their rage, aimed
at nothing less than his life, and yet what he complains of, more than all
beside, is the poison with which their words were imbued. It is probable that he
refers to the calumnious reports which he knew to be falsely spread to his
discredit, and with a view of damaging his reputation with the people.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shoot against the upright
and innocent</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he is to be considered as
contrasting his integrity with their unprincipled conduct. It inspired him with
confidence in his religious addresses, to know that he could exonerate his own
conscience from guilt, and that he was the object of undeserved attack by
worthless and abandoned men. In mentioning that <i>they shoot secretly </i>and
<i>suddenly, </i>he refers to the craft which characterised them. They were not
only eagerly bent upon mischief, and intent in watching their opportunities, but
so expert and quick in their movements, as to smite their victim before he could
suspect danger. When we hear that David, who was a man in every respect so much
more holy and upright in his conduct than ourselves, suffered from groundless
aspersions upon his character, we have no reason to be surprised that we should
be exposed to a similar trial. This comfort, at least, we always have, that we
can betake ourselves to God, and obtain his defense of the upright cause. He
takes particular notice of another circumstance, that they shot their empoisoned
arrows from their lips <i>without fear, </i>or shame. This self-secure spirit
argued a degree of abandoned presumption, in so far as they could persist in
obstinately pursuing the conduct in which they had been repeatedly detected, and
renew their desperate attempts, to the disregard of all fear of God or worldly
shame.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5<i>.</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>

perverse determination with which they pursued their wickedness, and of their
combinations amongst themselves; remarking, at the same time, upon the
confidence with which they stirred one another up to the most daring acts of
iniquity. In this there can be little doubt that they were encouraged by the
present state of weakness to which David was reduced in his circumstances,
taking occasion, when they found him in poverty and exile, and without means of
resistance, to persecute him with the greater freedom. Having adverted to them
as being beyond hope of amendment, and incapable of any impressions of humanity,
he speaks of their meeting together to plot his destruction; and, in connection
with this, of the unbounded confidence which they were led to display, from a
belief that their designs were not seen. It is well known that one circumstance
which strengthens the false security of the wicked, and encourages them to
triumph in their crafty policy towards the simple and upright in heart, is their
thinking that they can cover their crimes by such pretexts as they have always
at hand. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They say, Who shall see

run recklessly, and without restraint, in the ways of sin, blinded by their
pride, and influenced neither by the fear of God nor a sense of
shame.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the verse which follows, he
animadverts severely upon the deceit which they practiced. He speaks of their

secret methods of doing evil. He adds, that their malice was deep. By the

himself in the confident persuasion that his prayers have not been without
effect, but already answered. Though there was no appearance of God's
approaching judgment, he declares that it would suddenly be executed; and in
this he affords a remarkable proof of his faith. He saw the wicked hardening
themselves in their prosperity, and presuming upon impunity from the divine
connivance and forbearance; but instead of yielding to discouragement, he was
borne up by the belief that God, according to his usual mode of procedure with
the wicked, would visit them at an unexpected moment, when they were flattering
themselves with having escaped, and indulging in extravagant confidence. It is a
consideration which should comfort us, when subjected to long-continued trial,
that God, in delaying to punish the ungodly, does so with the express design of
afterwards inflicting judgments of a more condign description upon them, and
when they shall say, "Peace<i> </i>and safety," overwhelming them with sudden
destruction,

</i>Pursuing the same subject, he remarks, that the poison concocted in their
secret counsels, and which they revealed with their tongues, would prove to have
a deadly effect upon themselves. The sentiment is the same with that expressed
elsewhere by another figure, when they are said to be caught in their own
snares, and to fall into the pit which they have digged themselves,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;195706&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
57:6.) It is just that Heaven should make the mischiefs which they had devised
against innocent and upright men to recoil upon their own heads. The judgment is
one which we see repeatedly and daily exemplified before our eyes, and yet we
find much difficulty in believing that it can take place. We should feel
ourselves bound the more to impress the truth upon our hearts, that God is ever
watching, as it were, his opportunity of converting the stratagems of the wicked
into means just as completely effective of their destruction, as if they had
intentionally employed them for that end. In the close of the verse, to point
out the striking severity of their punishment, it is said that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all who saw them should flee
away</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The judgments of God are lifted
above out of the sight of an ignorant world, and ere it can be roused to fear
and dismay, these must be such as to bear signal marks indeed of a divine
hand.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9<i>.

more fully upon the good effects which would result from the judgment executed
in leading such as had formerly overlooked a Divine Providence altogether, to
catch a spirit of inquiry from the singularity of the spectacle; and acquaint
themselves with, and speak one to another of a subject hitherto entirely new to
them. He intimates, that the knowledge of what God had so signally wrought would
extend far and wide &#8212; for he says, <i>all men, </i>etc. The Hebrew verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lk&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

shall cause others to understand. </i>But as it is usual with David to repeat
the same thing twice, perhaps the latter or transitive sense is preferable.
Another desirable consequence which would flow from the deliverance granted is
mentioned in the last verse, that it would afford matter of joy, hope, and holy
triumph to the saints, who would be confirmed in expecting the same help from
God which he had extended to his servant David. Those formerly called the
<i>righteous </i>are now styled <i>the upright in heart, </i>to teach us, that
the only righteousness which proves acceptable is that which proceeds from
inward sincerity. This truth I have insisted upon at large
elsewhere.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This psalm is composed both of petition and
thanksgiving. It contains a prediction of the Gentiles being called to the
common faith, but is principally occupied with praising God for the fatherly
care which he exercises over his Church, and the benefits which flow from it.
The Psalmist prays particularly that God would continue his former kindness to
the Jewish people. Two instances of the Divine goodness are specified, &#8212;
the powerful defense extended to their land, and the enriching of it with so
many blessings.</font><br></div>

<i>dumiyah, </i>has been metaphorically rendered first, <i>to be at rest,
</i>then <i>to wait. </i>The meaning of the expression is, that God's goodness
to his people is such as to afford constantly new matter of praise. It is
diffused over the whole world, but specially shown to the Church. Besides,
others who do not belong to the Church of God, however abundantly benefits may
be showered upon them, see not whence they come, and riot in the blessings which
they have received without any acknowledgement of them. But the main thing meant
to be conveyed by the Psalmist is, that thanksgiving is due to the Lord for his
goodness shown to his Church and people. The second clause of the verse is to
the same effect, where he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unto thee shall the vow be
performed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for while he engages on the
part of the people to render due acknowledgement, his language implies that
there would be ever remaining and new grounds of
praise.</font><br><font face="Palatino">With the verse which we have been now
considering, that which follows stands closely connected, asserting that God
hears the prayers of his people. This forms a reason why the vow should be paid
to him, since God never disappoints his worshippers, but crowns their prayers
with a favorable answer. Thus, what is stated last, is first in the natural
order of consideration. The title here given to God carries with it a truth of
great importance, That the answer of our prayers is secured by the fact, that in
rejecting them he would in a certain sense deny his own nature. The Psalmist
does not say, that God has heard prayer in this or that instance, but gives him
the name of the hearer of prayer, as what constitutes an abiding part of his
glory, so that he might as soon deny himself as shut his ear to our petitions.
Could we only impress this upon our minds, that it is something peculiar to
<i>God, </i>and inseparable from him, to hear prayer, it would inspire us with
unfailing confidence. The power of helping us he can never want, so that nothing
can stand in the way of a successful issue of our supplications. What follows in
the verse is also well worthy of our attention, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all flesh shall
come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>unto God. None could venture into
his presence without a persuasion of his being open to entreaty; but when he
anticipates our fears, and comes forward declaring that prayer is never offered
to him in vain, the door is thrown wide for the admission of all. The hypocrite
and the ungodly, who pray under the constraint of present necessity, are not
heard; for they cannot be said to come to God, when they have no faith founded
upon his word, but a mere vague expectation of a chance issue. Before we can
approach God acceptably in prayer, it is necessary that his promises should be
made known to us, without which we can have no access to him, as is evident from
the words of the apostle Paul,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
3:12,) where he tells us, that all who would come to God must first be endued
with such a faith in Christ as may animate them wig confidence. From this we may
infer, that no right rule of prayer is observed in the Papacy, when they pray to
God in a state of suspense and doubt. Invaluable is the privilege which we enjoy
by the Gospel, of free access unto God. When the Psalmist uses the expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he intimates by these few words
that the privilege which was now peculiar to the Jews, would be extended to all
nations. It is a prediction of Christ's future
kingdom.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3<i>.

fb448</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He does not complain of the
people being assailed with calumny, but is to be understood as confessing that
their sins were the cause of any interruption which had taken place in the
communication of the divine favor to the Jews. The passage is parallel with
that,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The ear of the Lord is not
heavy that it cannot hear, but our iniquities have separated betwixt us and
him." &#8212; Isaiah 59:1</font><br><font face="Palatino">David imputes it to
his own sins and those of the people, that God, who was wont to be liberal in
his help, and so gracious and kind in inviting their dependence upon him, had
withdrawn for a time his divine countenance. First, he acknowledges his own
personal guilt; afterwards, like
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;270905&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
9:5, he joins the whole nation with himself. And this truth is introduced by the
Psalmist with no design to damp confidence in prayer, but rather to remove an
obstacle standing in the way of it, as none could draw near to God unless
convinced that he would hear the unworthy. It is probable that the Lord's people
were at theft time suffering under some token of the divine displeasure, since
David seems here to struggle with some temptation of this kind. He evidently
felt that there was a sure remedy at hand, for no sooner has he referred to the
subject of guilt, than he recognises the prerogative of God to pardon and
expiate it. The verse before us must be viewed in connection with the preceding,
and as meaning, that though their iniquities merited their being cast out of
God's sight, yet they would continue to pray, encouraged by his readiness to be
reconciled to them. We learn from the passage that God will not be entreated of
us, unless we humbly supplicate the pardon of our sins. On the other hand, we
are to believe firmly in reconciliation with God being procured through
gratuitous remission. Should he at any time withdraw his favor, and frown upon
us, we must learn by David's example to rise to the hope of the expiation of our
sins. The reason of his using the singular number, in the confession which he
makes of sin, may be, that as king he represented the whole people, or that he
intended, like Daniel, to exhort them each to an individual and particular
examination and confession of his own guilt. We know how apt hypocrites are to
hide their personal sin, under a formal acknowledgement of their share in the
general transgression. But David, from no affectation of humility, but from deep
inward conviction, begins with himself, and afterwards includes others in the
same charge.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm
65:4-8	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4</b>. Blessed is the man whom

</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Blessed is the man whom
thou hast chosen</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Having already
acknowledged that the people had separated themselves from God by their sins,
and forfeited all right to be heard, he now takes refuge in the free grace of
God, which secures the remission of sin amongst other blessings. He thus casts
an additional light upon what he had said on the point of guilt being purged
away, by pointing to the cause of God, as being favorable to poor sinners, which
can only be found in his fatherly love leading him to welcome them into his
presence, however undeserving. That pardon which we daily receive flows from our
adoption, and on it also are all our prayers founded. How could the sinner
venture into the sight of God, to obtain reconciliation with him, were he not
persuaded of his being a Father? In the words before us, David does not speak of
the grace of God as reaching to the Gentiles, (which he had done in a preceding
part of the psalm,) but in terms which apply only to the times in which he
wrote. The Church of God was confined to the Jews, and they only were admitted
into the sanctuary; whereas now, when the distinction has been abolished, and
other nations called to the same privilege, we are all at liberty to approach
him with familiarity. Christ is our peace,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:14,) who has united in one those who were far off, and those who were
nigh.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What has been now said may show at once
the scope of the Psalmist. The Church and chosen people of God being in
possession of the promise of the remission of sin, he calls those blessed whom
God has included within that number, and introduced into the enjoyment of such a
distinguished privilege. His language intimates, that the election did not at
that time terminate upon all; for he insists upon it as the special prerogative
of the Jews, that they had been chosen by God in preference to the other
nations. Were it supposed that man could do anything to anticipate the grace of
God, the election would cease to be with God himself, although the right and
power of it are expressly ascribed to
him.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb451</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But the Jews had no excellency above
others, except in the one point of having enjoyed the distinguishing favor of
God. The middle wall of partition is now broken down, that the Gentiles might be
called in. It is evident, however, that all are not alike called; and
observation proves the ignorance of those who will assert that the grace of God
is extended to all in common, without any choice exerted on his part. Can any
reason be imagined why God should not call all alike, except it be that his
sovereign election distinguishes some from others? Faith and prayer may be means
for procuring us an interest in the grace of God; but the source whence it flows
is not within but without us.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb452</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There is a blessedness in exercising
trust upon God, and embracing his promises &#8212; a blessedness experienced
when, through faith in Christ the Mediator, we apprehend him as our Father, and
direct our prayers to him in that character; &#8212; but ere this faith and
prayer can have any existence, it must be supposed that we who are estranged
from God by nature have been brought near by an exercise of his favor. We are
near him, not as having anticipated his grace, and come to him of ourselves, but
because, in his condescension, he has stretched out his hand as far as hell
itself to reach us. To speak more properly, he first elects us, and then
testifies his love by calling us. It is noticeable, also, that though God
separated the seed of Abraham to be a peculiar people, entitled as the
circumcision to a place in his temple, there can be no question that David
recognised a distinction even amongst those who were Jews, all not having been
the subjects of God's effectual calling, nor yet properly entitled to a place in
his temple. The Psalmist alludes, indeed, to the outward sanctuary, when he
speaks of the Jews as chosen to approach God; but we must remember (what was
brought under our attention,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
15:1 and
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;192403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
24:3) that all were not real members of the Church who trod the court of the
temple, but that the great qualifications necessary were the pure heart and the
clean hands. Accordingly, we must understand by those brought near to God, such
as present themselves before him in the exercise of genuine faith, and not such
as merely occupy a place in his temple as to outward appearance. But, again, the
being chosen, and the being called to approach God, are two things mentioned
here together, to correct any such vain idea as that the sheep of God's flock
are allowed to wander at will for any length of time, and not brought into the
fold.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb453</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This is one way by which our gratuitous
adoption is evidenced, that we come to the sanctuary under the leading of the
Holy Spirit.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Psalmist insists upon the fruit
springing out of the blessed privilege of which he had spoken, when he adds,
that believers </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>would be
satisfied</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>with the fullness of his
temple. Hypocrites may go there, but they return empty and unsatisfied as to any
spiritual blessing enjoyed. It is noticeable, that the person is changed in this
part of the verse, and that David associates himself with other believers,
preferring to speak upon this subject from personal experience. We are not to
understand that believers are fully replenished with the goodness of God at any
one moment; it is conveyed to them gradually; but while the influences of the
Spirit are thus imparted in successive measures, each of them is enriched with a
present sufficiency, till all be in due time advanced to perfection. I might
remark here, that while it is true, as stated,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
103:5,) that "God satisfieth our mouth with good things," at the same time it is
necessary to remember what is said elsewhere, "Open thy mouth, and I will fill
it." Our contracted desires is the reason why we do not receive a more copious
supply of blessings from God; he sees that we are straitened in ourselves, and
accommodates the communications of his goodness to the measure of our
expectations. By specifying particularly the <i>goodness of the sanctuary,
</i>the Psalmist passes an implied commendation upon the outward helps which God
has appointed for leading us into the enjoyment of heavenly blessings. In these
former times God could have directly stretched out his hand from heaven to
supply the wants of his worshippers, but saw fit to satisfy their souls by means
of the doctrine of the law, sacrifices, and other rites and external aids to
piety. Similar are the means which he employs in the Church still; and though we
are not to rest in these, neither must we neglect
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Terrible
things</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb454</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> in righteousness wilt
thou answer to us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He proceeds to
illustrate, although in a somewhat different form, the same point of the
blessedness of those who are admitted into the temple of God, and nourished in
his house. He declares that God would answer his people by miracles or fearful
signs, displaying his power; as if he had said, in deliverances as wonderful as
those which he wrought for their fathers when they went out of Egypt. It is in
no common or ordinary manner that God has preserved his Church, but with
terrible majesty. It is well that this should be known, and the people of God
taught to sustain their hopes in the most apparently desperate exigencies. The
Psalmist speaks of the deliverances of God as specially enjoyed by the Jewish
nation, but adds, that he was </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
hope of the ends of the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>even to
the world's remotest extremities. Hence it follows, that the grace of God was to
be extended to the Gentiles.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By his strength setting
fast the mountains</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For the sake of
illustration, he instances the power of God seen in the general fabric of the
world. In these times it sounded as a new and strange truth to say that the
Gentiles should be called to the same hope with the Jews. To prove that it was
not so incredible as they were apt to conceive, the Psalmist very properly
adverts to the Divine power apparent in all parts of the world. He instances the
mountains rather than the plains, because the immense masses of earth, and the
lofty rocks which they present, convey a more impressive idea of the Godhead.
Interpreters are not agreed as to the exact meaning of the verse which follows.
Some think that the mark of similitude must be supplied before the first word of
the sentence, and that it is meant to be said that God stills the tumults of men
when raging in their insolent attempts, as he stills the agitations of the sea.
Others understand the first part of the verse to be a metaphorical declaration
of what is plainly stated in the close. I would take the words simply as they
stand, and consider that in the first member of the verse, David adverts to the
illustration of the divine power which we have in the sea, and in the second to
that which we have in his operations amongst men. His strength is shown in
calming the waves and tempestuous swellings of the ocean. It is put forth also
in quelling tumults which may have been raised by the
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They also that
dwell</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc. </i>By the <i>signs </i>referred
to, we must evidently understand those signal and memorable works of the Lord
which bear the impress of his glorious hand. It is true, that the minutest and
meanest objects, whether in the heavens or upon the earth, reflect to some
extent the glory of God; but the name mentioned emphatically applies to
miracles, as affording a better display of the divine majesty. So striking would
be the proofs of God's favor to his Church, that, as the Psalmist here intimates
to us, they would constrain the homage and wonder of the most distant and
barbarous nations. In the latter part of the verse, if we take the
interpretation suggested by some, nothing more is meant, than that when the sun
rises in the morning, men are refreshed by its light; and again, that when the
moon and stars appear at night, they are relieved from the gloom into which they
must otherwise have been sunk. Were this interpretation adopted, a preposition
must be understood; as if it had been said, Thou makest men to rejoice <i>on
account of, </i>or <i>by </i>the rising of the sun, of the moon, and of the
stars. But the words, as they stand, convey a sense which is sufficiently
appropriate without having recourse to any addition. It was said, that in
consequence of the wonders done by the Lord, fear would spread itself over the
uttermost parts of the earth; and the same thing is now asserted of the joy
which they would shed abroad: from the rising to the setting sun, men would
rejoice in the Lord, as well as fear
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

applies to the earth generally, he refers more particularly to Judea, as the
former part of the psalm has been occupied with recounting the kindness of God
to his own Church and people more especially. This view is confirmed by what is
added, <i>the stream </i>or </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>river
of God is full of water</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some take the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>river of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to mean a great or mighty
river,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb458</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but such a rendering is harsh and
overstrained, and on that supposition, <i>rivers, </i>in the plural number,
would have been the form of expression used. I consider that he singles out the
small rivulet of Siloah,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb459</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and sets it in opposition to the
natural rivers which enrich other countries, intending an allusion to the word
of Moses,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
11:10,) that the land which the Lord their God should give unto his people would
not be as the land of Egypt, fertilized by the overflowings of the Nile, but a
land drinking water of the rain of heaven. Or we may suppose that he calls the
rain itself metaphorically </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
river of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb460</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The words must, at any rate, be
restricted to Judea, as by <i>the pastures </i>or <i>dwellings of the
wilderness, </i>we are also to understand the more dry and uncultivated
districts, called in Scripture "the hill country." But while it is the kindness
of God to his own people which is here more particularly celebrated as being
better known, we are bound, in whatever part of the world we live, to
acknowledge the riches of the Divine goodness seen in the earth's fertility and
increase. It is not of itself that it brings forth such an inexhaustible variety
of fruits, but only in so far as it has been fitted by God for producing the
food of man. Accordingly, there is a propriety and force in the form of
expression used by the Psalmist when he adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>corn is provided for man, because
the earth has been so prepared by
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb461</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which means, that the reason of
that abundance with which the earth teems, is its having been expressly formed
by God in his fatherly care of the great household of mankind, to supply the
wants of his children.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou dost saturate its
furrows</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some take the verbs as being in
the optative mood, and construe the words as a prayer. But there can be little
doubt that David still continues the strain of thanksgiving, and praises God for
moistening and saturating the earth with rains that it may be fitted for
producing fruit. By this he would signify to us, that the whole order of things
in nature shows the fatherly love of God, in condescending to care for our daily
sustenance. He multiplies his expressions when speaking of a part of the divine
goodness, which many have wickedly and impiously disparaged. It would seem as if
the more perspicacity men have in observing second causes in nature, they will
rest in them the more determinedly, instead of ascending by them to God.
Philosophy ought to lead us upwards to him, the more that it penetrates into the
mystery of his works; but this is prevented by the corruption and ingratitude of
our hearts; and as those who pride themselves in their acuteness, avert their
eye from God to find the origin of rain in the air and the elements, it was the
more necessary to awaken us out of such a
spirit.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11<i>.</i>

crownest the year </i>of <i>thy goodness; </i>as if the Psalmist meant that the
fertile year had a peculiar glory attached to it, and were crowned, so to speak,
by God. Thus, if there was a more abundant crop or vintage than usual, this
would be the crown of the year. And it must be granted that God does not bless
every year alike. Still there is none but what is crowned with some measure of
excellency; and for that reason it would seem best to retain the simpler
rendering of the words, and view them as meaning that the Divine goodness is
apparent in the annual returns of the season. The Psalmist further explains what
he intended, when he adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the paths of God dropped
fatness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> &#8212; using this as a
metaphorical term for <i>the clouds, </i>upon which God rideth, as upon
chariots, as we read in

fb463</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The earth derives its fruitfulness from
the sap or moisture; this comes from the rain, and the rain from the clouds.
With a singular gracefulness of expression, these are therefore represented as
dropping fatness, and this because they are the paths or vehicles of God; as if
he had said, that, wherever the Deity walked there flowed down from his feet
fruits in endless variety and abundance. He amplifies this goodness of God, by
adding, that his fatness drops even upon the wilder and more uncultivated
districts. The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wilderness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is not to be taken here for the absolute waste where nothing grows, but for
such places as are not so well cultivated, where there are few inhabitants, and
where, notwithstanding, the Divine goodness is even more illustrated than
elsewhere in dropping down fatness upon the tops of the
mountains.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

</i>and lower grounds <i>are clothed with
flocks,</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb465</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as well as with corn. He
represents inanimate things as rejoicing, which may be said of them in a certain
sense, as when we speak of the fields smiling, when they refresh our eye with
their beauty. It may seem strange, that he should first tell us, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shout for
joy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and then add the feebler
expression, that <i>they sing; </i>interposing, too, the intensative particle,

taken in the future tense, <i>they shall sing, </i>and this denotes a
continuation of joy, that they would rejoice, not only one year, but through the
endless succession of the seasons. I may add, what is well known, that in Hebrew
the order of expression is frequently inverted in this way.</font><br></div>

which the Psalmist celebrates here in the name of the Church, but he includes
the many and various mercies which God had all along conferred upon his chosen

crisis of great mercy and distress, he suggests it as matter of comfort under
trial, that their subjection to the tyranny of their enemies had been designed
to prove them as silver in the furnace. At the close, he would appear to speak

such as might otherwise be remiss in the service.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To sing the honor of his name,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">is an expression sufficiently obvious; meaning,
that we should extol his sacred name in a manner suitable to its dignity, so
that it may obtain its due and deserved adoration. But the clause which follows
is rather ambiguous. Some think that it conveys a repetition of the same idea
contained in other words, and read, <i>set forth the glory of his
praise.</i></font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb469</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I prefer taking the Hebrew word
signifying<i> praise </i>to be in the accusative case; rendering the words

excellence.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Say unto God, How

proceeds to state the grounds why he would have us to praise God. Many content
themselves with coldly descanting to others of his praises, but with the view of
awakening and more deeply impressing our hearts, he directs us to address
ourselves immediately to God. It is when we hold converse with him apart, and
with no human eye to witness us, that we feel the vanity of hypocrisy, and will
be likely to utter only what we have well and seriously meditated in our hearts.
Nothing tends more to beget a reverential awe of God upon our spirits than
sisting ourselves in his presence. What the Psalmist adds is fitted and designed
to produce the same feeling, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that
through the greatness of God's power, his enemies feign submission to
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Are they who would perversely and
obstinately revolt from his service, forced to humble themselves before him,
whether they will it or not, how much more, then, ought his own children to
serve him, who are invited into his presence, by the accents of tenderness,
instead of being reduced to subjection by terror? There is an implied contrast
drawn between the voluntary homage which they yield, as attracted by the sweet
influences of grace, and that slavish obedience which is wrung reluctantly from
the unbeliever. The Hebrew word here used for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
lie</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>signifies to yield such a
submission as is constrained, and not free or cordial, as
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191845&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
18:45. Neither the words nor the scope favor the other senses which have been
suggested, as, that his enemies would acknowledge themselves to have been
deceived in their hopes, or that they would deny having ever intended
hostilities against him. There are many ways in which hypocrites may
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lie</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

the perversity of men, that they will scarcely lift one feeble note in
celebration of a theme which should command their united strength and might. We
have another prediction here, of a time being to come when God would be
worshipped, not only by the Jews, a small section of the human family, but by
all the nations which would be eventually brought under his government. And we
are not to consider that he refers to such a worship as would be constrained,
and only not withheld, because resistance might be dangerous, but to the sincere

upon that almost universal thoughtlessness which leads men to neglect the
praises of God. Why is it that they so blindly overlook the operations of his
hand, but just because they never direct their attention seriously to them? We
need to be aroused upon this subject. The words before us may receive some
explanation by referring to a parallel passage,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;194608&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
46:8. But the great scope of them is this, that the Psalmist would withdraw men
from the vain or positively sinful and pernicious pursuits in which they are
engaged, and direct their thoughts to the works of God. To this he exhorts them,
chiding their backwardness and negligence. The expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come and
see</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>intimates that what they blindly
overlooked was open to observation; for were it otherwise with the works of God,
this language would be inappropriate. He next points out what those works of God
are to which he would have our attention directed; in general he would have us
look to the method in which God governs the human family. This experimental or
practical kind of knowledge, if I might so call it, is that which makes the
deepest impression.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;441727&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts

upon this one particular point, and calls upon us to descend into ourselves if
we would discover the proofs of a present God. The last clause of the fifth
verse I would not interpret with some as meaning that God was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>terrible above the children of
men</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; superior to them in majesty &#8212;

40:5. Men need look no further, therefore, than themselves, in order to discover
the best grounds for reverencing and fearing God. The Psalmist passes next from
the more general point of his providence towards mankind at large, to his
special care over his own Church, adverting to what he had done for the
redemption of his chosen people. What he states here must be considered as only
one illustration of many which he might have touched upon, and as intended to
remind God's people of the infinite variety of benefits with which their first
and great deliverance had been followed up and confirmed. This appears obvious
from what he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there we
rejoiced in him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is impossible that
the joy of that deliverance could have extended to him or any of the descendants
of the ancient Israelites, unless it had partaken the nature of a pledge and
illustration of the love of God to the Church generally. Upon that event he
showed himself to be the everlasting Savior of his people; so that it proved a
common source of joy to all the righteous.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.

was the proper seat of his kingdom; but his providence always extended to the
world at large; and the special favor shown to the posterity of Abraham, in
consideration of the covenant, did not prevent him from extending an eye of
providential consideration to the surrounding nations. As an evidence of his
care reaching to the different countries round, he takes notice of the judgments
which God executed upon the wicked and the ungodly. He proves that there was no
part of the human family which God overlooked, by referring to the fact of the
punishment of evil-doers. There may be much in the Divine administration of the
world calculated to perplex our conclusions; but there are always some tokens to
be seen of his judgments, and these sufficiently clear to strike the eye of an
acute and attentive
observer.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8<i>.</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>

</i>Although calling upon all, without exception, to praise God, he refers
particularly to some Divine interposition in behalf of the Church. He would seem
to hint that the Gentiles were destined, at a future period, to share the favor
now exclusively enjoyed by God's chosen people. In the meantime, he reminds them
of the signal and memorable nature of the deliverance granted, by calling upon
them to spread abroad the fame of it. Though he speaks of the Jewish people as
having been <i>brought unto life, </i>(an expression intended to denote
deliverance of a more than ordinary kind,) this means that they had been
preserved from approaching danger rather than recovered from a calamity which
had actually overtaken them, It is said that <i>their feet had not been suffered
to fall, </i>which implies, that, through seasonable help which they had
received, they had not fallen, but stood firm. The Psalmist, however, does not
take occasion, from the evil having been anticipated and averted, to undervalue
it. As they had been preserved safe by an interposition of Divine goodness, he
speaks of this as tantamount to having been brought or restored to
life.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

and is brought forward by the Psalmist to enhance the goodness of God, who had
delivered them from such severe calamities. But there is another object which I
consider him to have in view, and this is the alleviation of the grief of God's
people, by setting before them the comfort suggested by the words which follow.
When visited with affliction, it is of great importance that we should consider
it as coming from God, and as expressly intended for our good. It is in
reference to this that the Psalmist speaks of their having been <i>proved and
tried.</i> At the same time, while he adverts to God's trying his children with
the view of purging away their sin, as dross is expelled from the silver by
fire, he would intimate, also, that trial had been made of their patience. The
figure implies that their probation had been severe; for silver is cast
repeatedly into the furnace. They express themselves thankful to God, that,
while proved with affliction, they had not been destroyed by it; but that their
affliction was both varied and very severe, appears not only from the metaphor,
but from the whole context, where they speak of having been cast into the net,
being reduced to straits, men riding over their heads, and of being brought
through shipwreck and conflagration.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">fb478</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The expression, <i>laying a restraint </i>[or <i>chain</i>]<i> upon their loins,
</i>is introduced as being stronger than the one which goes before. It was not a
net of thread which had been thrown over them, but rather they had been bound
down with hard and insolvable fetters. The expression which follows refers to
men who had shamefully tyrannised over them, and ridden them down as cattle. By
<i>fire </i>and <i>water </i>are evidently meant complicated afflictions; and it
is intimated that God had exercised his people with every form of calamity. They
are the two elements which contribute more than any other to sustain human life,
but are equally powerful for the destruction of it. It is noticeable, that the
Psalmist speaks of all the cruelties which they had most unjustly suffered from
the hands of their enemies, as an infliction of Divine punishment; and would
guard the Lord's people against imagining that God was ignorant of what they had
endured, or distracted by other things from giving attention to it. In their
condition, as here described, we have that of the Church generally represented
to us; and this, that when subjected to vicissitudes, and cast out of the fire
into the water, by a succession of trials, there may at last be felt to be
nothing new or strange in the event to strike us with alarm. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hywr</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
revayah, </i>which I have rendered <i>fruitful place, </i>means literally <i>a
well-watered land. </i>Here it is taken metaphorically for a condition of
prosperity, the people of God being represented as brought into a pleasant and
fertile place, where there is abundance of pasturage. The truth conveyed is,
that God, although he visit his children with temporary chastisements of a
severe description, will ultimately crown them with joy and prosperity. It is a
mistake to suppose that the allusion is entirely to their being settled in the
land of Canaan,</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb479</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for the psalm has not merely reference
to the troubles which they underwent in the wilderness, but to the whole series

gives expression to his own private feelings, and calls upon them, by his
example, to engage individually in the exercises of religion, it being
impossible that there should be any hearty common consent unless each entered
seriously upon the service of thanksgiving for himself and apart. We are taught
that when God at any time succours us in our adversity, we do an injustice to
his name if we forget to celebrate our deliverances with solemn
acknowledgements. More is spoken of in this passage than thanksgiving. He speaks
of vows having been contracted by him in his affliction, and these evidenced the
constancy of his faith. The exhortation of the Apostle James is worthy of our
special notice &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">How many are there who lavish their hypocritical
praises upon God in the career of their good fortune, while they are no sooner
reduced to straits than the fervor of their love is damped, or gives place to
the violence of fretfulness and impatience. The best evidence of true piety is
when we sigh to God under the pressure of our afflictions, and show, by our
prayers, a holy perseverance in faith and patience; while afterwards we come
forward with the expression of our gratitude. The words, <i>which my lips have
uttered, </i>are not an unmeaning addition, but imply that he had never allowed
himself to be so far overcome by grief as not to throw his desires into the
express form of petition, declaring that he cast himself for safety into the
hands of God. On the subject of vows, I may just shortly repeat the remarks
which have been given at greater length elsewhere. First, the holy fathers never
vowed anything to God but what they knew to be sanctioned by his approval.
Secondly, their sole end in vowing was to evidence their gratitude. The Papists,
therefore, can find no warrant, from their example, for the rash and impious
vows which they practice. They obtrude upon God whatever chances to come first
into their lips; the end which they propose to themselves is the farthest
removed from the right one; and with devilish presumption they engage themselves
to things which are not allowed
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15<i>.</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>I will offer unto thee burnt-sacrifices of fatlings.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">We must suppose the speaker to be either David
or one of the more considerable men of the nation, for none in humbler
circumstances could have offered rich sacrifices of this kind. It is probable
that David was the author of the psalm, and here he signifies his intention to
show a kingly liberality in his offerings. The reason why God ordered victims to
be offered as an expression of thanksgiving was, as is well known, to teach the
people that their praises were polluted by sin, and needed to be sanctified from
without. However we might propose to ourselves to praise the name of God, we
could only profane it with our impure lips, had not Christ once offered himself
up a sacrifice, to sanctify both us and our services. (Hebrews 10:7) It is
through him, as we learn from the apostle, that our praises are accepted. The
Psalmist, by way of commendation of his burnt-offering, speaks of its incense or
sweet savor; for although in themselves vile and loathsome, yet the rams and
other victims, so far as they were figures of Christ, sent up a sweet savor unto
God.</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">
fb481</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Now that the shadows of the Law have
been abolished, attentionis called to the true spiritual service. What this
consists in, is more clearly brought under our notice in the verse which
follows, where the Psalmist tells us, that he would spread abroad the fame of
the benefits which he had received from God. Such was the end designed, even in
the outward ceremonies under the Law, apart from which they could only be
considered as an empty show. It was this &#8212; the fact, that they set forth
the praises of the divine goodness &#8212; which formed the very season of the
sacrifices, preserving them from insipidity. In calling, as he does, upon all
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the fearers of the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the Psalmist teaches us, that if
we duly feel the goodness of God, we will be inflamed with a desire to publish
it abroad, that others may have their faith and hope confirmed, by what they
hear of it, as well as join with us in a united song of praise. He addresses
himself to none but such as feared the Lord, for they only could appreciate what
he had to say, and it would have been lost labor to communicate it to the
hypocritical and ungodly.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="4"><b>Psalm

to Divine interposition, from the circumstance of his having prayed, and in
consequence, having sensibly experienced his kindness. Answers to prayer serve
in no small degree to illustrate the goodness of God; and confirm our faith in
it. In saying that he cried to God with his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tongue</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>these are terms denoting, as we have seen in a previous part of the psalm,
the vehemency and earnestness with which he prayed. Had he not prayed from the
heart, he would have been rejected, but he makes mention of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tongue</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>also, in token of the ardor of his supplications. Some absurdly imagine,
that because the expression <i>under the tongue </i>is used, the meaning is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with the
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Words are said to come from under
the tongue, because they are formed by the flexion of the tongue, as in that
passage,</font><br></div>

140:3)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The term <i>extol </i>intimates, that we cannot honor
God more in our worship, than by looking upwards to him for deliverance. The
Papists rob him of a chief part of his glory, when they direct their prayers to
the dead or to images, and make such little account of calling upon the name of
the Lord.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Psalmist next lays down the rule,
which must be attended to, if we would pray properly and acceptably; guarding
against that presumptuous exercise which overlooks the necessity of faith and
penitence. We see with what audacity hypocrites and ungodly men associate
themselves with the Lord's people, in compliance with the general calls of the
word to engage in prayer. To check this solemn mockery, the Psalmist mentions
integrity of heart as indispensable. I am aware that the words may be considered
as an assertion of his own personal uprightness of conduct, as we find him
frequently vindicating this, by an appeal to the visible and practical proofs
which God had shown of his favor to him; but his main object is evidently to
enforce by the example of his own exercise the common propriety of drawing near
to God with a pure heart. We have a parallel scripture in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430931&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
9:31, "We know that God heareth not sinners." In one sense, he hears none but
sinners; for we must all conform to the great rule of applying to him for the
remission of our sins. But while believers make an unreserved confession of
guilt before God, by this very thing they cease to be sinners, for God pardons
them in answer to their supplications. We are not to forget the words of
Paul,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Let every one that
nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity," &#8212;
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;550219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Timothy 2:19)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, to <i>regard iniquity in the heart </i>does
not mean to be conscious of sin &#8212; for all the Lord's people must see their
sins and be grieved for them, and this is rather praiseworthy than condemnable;
&#8212; but to be bent upon the practice of iniquity. He particularly refers to
the <i>heart, </i>intimating that not only were his hands clean, in the sense of
his being innocent before men, but that he could appeal to God in proof of his
inward integrity. When the heart does not correspond to the outward conduct, and
harbours any secret evil intent, the fair exterior appearance may deceive men;
but it is an abomination in the sight of God, The Psalmist affirms with
emphasis, that his prayers had been answered, and we ought to draw the inference
that we shall never be disappointed, if we seek God in
sincerity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20<i>.

the psalm, as he began it, with thanksgiving, and gives the reason of his not

employs, of God's not having

and means here, that the wicked man described endeavors by plausible arguments
to put a soft, smooth, and fair gloss on his wickedness, as if there were
nothing repulsive and hateful about it, nothing amiss or blame-worthy in it; and
in this way he deceives himself. This is the sense expressed in the literal
translation of Montanus, which seems very forcible: "Quoniam lenivit ad se in
oculis ipsius, ad inveniendum iniquitatem suam ad odiendam." &#8212; "For he has
smoothed over [or set a polish] to himself in his own eyes, with respect to the
finding out of his iniquity, [that is, so as not to find it out,] to hate it."

<div><font face="Palatino">"He sets such a false gloss, " says this critic, "in

his iniquity, which, were it perceived by him, would be hateful even to

upon the most unprincipled maxims and pernicious practices. It will be seen that
Montanus' and Horsley's translation of the last clause of the verse gives a
different meaning from that given by Calvin. The original text is somewhat
obscure and ambiguous from its brevity; but it seems to support the sense given
by these critics. The Hebrew is,

It is generally supposed that there is here an allusion to the sacrificial

wholly and rapidly consumed by the fire of the altar of burnt-offering, so the
wicked shall melt away and be quickly consumed in the fire of Jehovah's wrath.

The proper signification of the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jrza</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>azrach</i>, has been controverted among interpreters, and it has been
variously rendered. Most of the Rabbins, and many modern commentators, as Mudge,
Waterland, Gesenius, and others, are of opinion, that the preferable reading is,
"like an indigenous or native tree;" that is, a tree which flourishes in its
native soil, where it grows most vigorously, and acquires its largest and most
luxuriant growth. The Septuagint translates it,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">w&lt;v ta&lt;v ce&gt;drouv tou
Liba&gt;nou</font><font face="Palatino">, "as the cedars of Lebanon;" being
self-growing, spreading, and lofty trees. Some suppose that the translators of
this version must have had a different reading in their Hebrew Bibles from what
is in our present copies; and others that, as is common with them, they
paraphrase the original words, the more clearly to express their meaning. The
translation of the Septuagint is followed by the Vulgate, Arabic, and Ethiopic
versions, by Houbigant, Boothroyd, Geddes, and other good authorities. Ainsworth
reads, "as a green self-growing laurel." Bythner says he is at a loss for the
reason of translating the word <i>laurel</i>. "For the reading of <i>bay
tree</i>," says the illustrated Commentary upon the Bible, "we are not aware of
any authority, except the very feeble one which is offered by some of the older
of the modern versions in this country and on the
Continent."</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb47</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The Suptuagint, Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic versions, Jerome, Houbigant,
Horsley, and Walford, read the verb in the first person, "But I passed by." The
Chaldee adheres to the Hebrew, "And he passed, <i>or</i> failed, from the age,
<i>or</i> world, and, lo! he was
not."</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb48</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This title occurs only here and in the 70th psalm. This psalm is the third of
what are called the Penitential Psalms. The two before this are the 6th and the
32d; and the four which follow it are the 51st, the 102d, the 130th, and the
143d. It is a curious fact, that when Galileo was sentenced to be confined in
the dungeons of the Inquisition for an indefinite period, for having maintained
the Copernican system, he was enjoined to repeat as a penance these seven
Penitential Psalms every week for three years; by which it was doubtless
intended to extort a sort of confession from him of his guilt, and an
acknowledgement of the justice of his
sentence.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb49</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
That is, they enter deep into the flesh. The Septuagint reads,

fastened in me;" which is a natural consequence of entering deep, and rather
expresses the meaning, than conveys the precise idea of the original word. The
Syriac and Arabic versions give the same rendering with the
Vulgate.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb50</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

think that the Septuagint has been corrupted, and others the Hebrew. Grotius is

accuracy of the Hebrew text as it now stands, that the Syriac, Chaldee, and
Vulgate versions agree with it, and that in all the MSS. collated by Kennicott
and De Rossi there is not a single variation. With respect to the Apostle's
quoting from the Septuagint instead of the Hebrew, it is sufficient to say, that
he did so because the Septuagint was then in common use. And it is worthy of
observation, that his argument does not depend on the word,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sw~ma de&lt; kathrti&gt;sw

omitted: for it is not made to depend on the <i>manner </i>of the obedience.

Kings 14:13. And <i>Belial </i>is used by the Hebrews to designate any
detestable wickedness. Thus the original words bring out the meaning which
Calvin fixes upon them; and in the same sense they are understood by several
critics. Dr Geddes reads "a lawless deed;" and he explains the expression as
referring to "David's sin in the case of Uriah; which his enemies now assign as
the cause of his present calamity; as if they had said, 'This sin hath at length
overtaken him,' etc." Horsley reads, "Some cursed thing presseth heavily upon
him;" and by "some cursed thing" he understands "the crime which they supposed
to be the cause of the divine judgment upon him." Fry reads, "Some hellish crime
cleaveth unto him." Cresswell adopts the interpretation of M. Flaminius: "They
say, Some load of iniquity presses upon him, (or clings to him,) so that from
the place where he lieth he will rise no more." But there is another sense which
the words will bear. The Septuagint reads,
"</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">lo&gt;gov
para&gt;nomov</font><font face="Palatino">;"<i> </i>the Vulgate, "a wicked
word;" the Chaldee, "a perverse word;" the Syriac, "a word of iniquity;" and the
Arabic, "words contrary to law;" and so the expression may mean a grievous
slander or calumny. This is the sense in which it is understood by Hammond. "And
this," says he, "is said <i>to cleave </i>to him on whom it is fastened; it
being the nature of calumnies, when strongly affixed on any, to cleave fast, and
leave some evil mark behind them: "<i>Calumniare fortiter</i>,<i> aliquid
hoerebit</i>."<i> </i>In<i> </i>our vulgar version it is "an evil disease." And
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rbd</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>debar</i>,<i> </i>no doubt sometimes signifies a <i>plague </i>or

smitten with an evil disease on account of his crimes, from which he will never
recover.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb106</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
So Hammond reads with our English version, <i>Now that he lieth he shall rise
again no more</i>,<i> </i>and thinks that this is a proverbial phrase which was
in use among the Hebrews, and which was applied to any sort of ruin, as well as
to that which is effected by bodily disease. "The calumniator," he observes,
"may destroy and ruin as well as the pestilence; and from him was David's danger
most frequently, and not from a pestilential
disease."</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb107</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

The Hebrew Psalter is divided into five books. This is the end of the first
book. The second ends with the 72d psalm, the third with the 89th, the fourth
with the 106th, and the fifth with the 150th. It is worthy of remark, that each
of these five books solemnly concludes with a distinct ascription of praise to
God; only no distinct doxology appears at the end of the fifth book, probably
because the last psalm throughout is a psalm of praise. The Jewish writers
affirm that this form of benediction was added by the person who collected and
distributed The Psalms into their present state. How ancient this division is,
cannot now be clearly ascertained. Jerome, in his Epistle to Marcella, and
Epiphanius, speak of The Psalms as having been divided by the Hebrews into five
books; but when this division was made, they do not inform us. The forms of
ascription of praise, added at the end of each of the five books, are in the
Septuagint version, from which we may conclude that this distribution had been
made before that version was executed. It was probably made by Ezra, after the
return of the Jews from Babylon to their own country, and the establishment of
the worship of God in the new temple; and it was perhaps made in imitation of a
similar distribution of the books of Moses. In making this division of the
Hebrew Psalter, regard appears to have been paid to the subject-matter of the
psalms.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb112</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Horsley also reads, "crieth." In the Hebrew it is "brayeth." In Hebrew there are
distinct words to mark the peculiar cries of the hart, the bear, the lion, the
zebra, the wolf, the horse, the dog, the cow, and the sheep. The distressing cry
of the hart seems to be here expressed. Being naturally of a hot and sanguine
constitution, it suffers much from thirst in the Oriental regions. When in want
of water, and unable to find it, it makes a mournful noise, and eagerly seeks
the cooling river; and especially when pursued over the dry and parched
wilderness by the hunter, it seeks the stream of water with intense desire, and
braying plunges into it with eagerness, as soon as it has reached its wished-for
banks, at once to quench its thirst and escape its deadly pursuers. It is the
female hart which is here meant, as "brayeth" is feminine, and as the reading of
the LXX. also shows, which is, </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">hJ

In this verse, there is evidently a reference to the festive religious
solemnities of the Jews, in which singing and dancing were used. These also
formed an eminent part of the religious rites of the ancient Greeks and other
heathen nations. Among the Greeks at the present day, it is the practice for a
lady of distinction to lead the dance, and to be followed by a troop of young
females, who imitate her steps, and if she sings, make up the chorus. This
serves to throw light on the description given of Miriam, when she "took a
timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and
dances,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
15:20.) She led the dance; they followed and imitated her steps. When David
"danced before the Lord" at the bringing up of the ark, "with shouting and with
the sound of the trumpet," it is probable that he was accompanied by others whom
he led in the dance,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;100615&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2

"A waterspout is a large tube or cylinder formed of clouds, by means of the
electric fluid, the base being uppermost, and the point let down perpendicularly
from the clouds. It has a particular kind of <i>circular motion </i>at the
point; and being hollow within attracts vast quantities of water; which it
frequently pours down in torrents on the earth or the sea. So great is the
quantity of water, and so sudden and precipitate the fall, that if it happen to
break on a vessel, it shatters it to pieces, and sinks it in an instant. Those
waterspouts which Dr Shaw saw in the Mediterranean, he informs us, "seemed to be
so many cylinders of water falling down from the clouds;" and he states, that
they "are more frequent near the capes of Latikea, Greego, and Carmel, than in
any other part of the Mediterranean." &#8212; (<i>Travels</i>, p. 333.) "These
are all places," as Harmer observes, "on the coast of Syria, and the last of
them every body knows in Judea, it being a place rendered famous by the prayers
of the prophet Elijah. The Jews then could not be ignorant of what happened on
their coasts; and David must have known of these dangers of the sea, if he had
not actually seen some of them." &#8212; (<i>Observations</i>,<i> </i>volume 3,
p. 222.) In the description of a violent and dangerous storm at sea, by which he
here portrays his great distress, he would, therefore, naturally draw his
imagery from these awful phenomena, which were of frequent occurrence on the
Jewish
coasts.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb123</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

All the ancient versions, with the exception of the Chaldee, read both in this
and the fifth verse, "my countenance." Hammond thinks that as these words are
the burden of this and the following psalm, and as the meaning of the other
words of the sentence in which they occur is the same in the different verses,
it is not improbable that the old reading in both places may have been "my

This and the preceding psalm have been considered by the greater number of
critics as having originally formed only one psalm, and they make but one in
forty-six MSS. The similarity of the style, sentiment, and metrical structure,
and the occurrence of the intercalary verse at verses 5th and 10th of Psalm 42,
and verse 5th of Psalm 43, confirm this opinion. "The fact, indeed," says
Williams, "is self evident, and easily accounted for. The Jewish choristers
having, on some occasion, found the anthem too long, have divided it for their
own conveniency, (no uncommon thing among choristers,) and, being once divided,
it was ignorantly supposed it ought to be so

Matthias may have been its author. See 1 Maccabees ch. 1 and 2. Walford refers
it to the same period. There is, certainly, no part of the history of the Jews
with which we are acquainted, to which the statement made in the 17th verse is
so applicable as to the time when they were so cruelly persecuted for their
religion by Antiochus Epiphanes, King of Syria, and when, notwithstanding, the
great mass of the people displayed an invincible determination to keep
themselves from the pollutions of idolatry, and to adhere to the worship of the

The reading in our English version is, "and cast them out," namely, the heathen.
But Calvin's rendering seems to be more suitable to the genius of the Hebrew
poetry, and it also agrees with the meaning of the original. "The whole
metaphor," says Dr Geddes, "is taken from the vine, or some other luxuriant
tree. In our common version, 'and cast them out,' the parallelism is lost, and
the beauty of the sentence disappears." The Hebrew verb here used is generally
applied to the germination of plants, or to the shooting and spreading forth of
branches. God caused his chosen people to spread abroad, to cast or shoot forth
like the branches of a
vine.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb134</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Geddes reads, "Our King" "The Hebrew," says he, "has <i>my King</i>;<i> </i>but
as the Psalmist speaks in the name of his nation, the plural number is
preferable in English, as in numerous other instances." "The speaker throughout
the psalm," says Walford, "is the Church, which accounts for the use of both the
singular and plural numbers in different
parts."</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb135</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

"Lequel les autres traduisent dragons" This is the sense in which the expression
is understood by several eminent critics. Aquila explains it thus: "In a desert
place where great serpents are found;" and Bishop Hare thus: "In desert places
among wild beasts and serpents. <i>The place of dragons</i>,<i> </i>observes
Bishop Mant, appears to mean the wilderness; in illustration of which, it may be
noticed from Dr Shaw, that 'vipers, especially in the wilderness of Sin, which
might be called the inheritance of dragons, (see
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;390103&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
1:3,) were very dangerous and troublesome; not only our camels, but the Arabs
who attended them, running every moment the risk of being bitten.'" Viewed in
this light, we must understand the language either as meaning that the
Israelites had been driven from their dwellings and places of abode, and
compelled to dwell in some gloomy wilderness infested by serpents; or that the
fierce and cruel persecutors into whose hands God had delivered them are
compared to serpents, and that the circumstances in which the chosen tribes were
now placed resembled those of a people who had fallen into a wilderness, where
they heard nothing but the hissing of serpents, and the howlings of beasts of

It is somewhat strange, after making the above observations, that Calvin should
consider this beautiful psalm as referring primarily to Solomon, and to his
marriage with the daughter of Pharaoh. That this is an epithalamium or nuptial
song, is readily admitted; but that it refers to the nuptials of Solomon with
Pharaoh's daughter, there seems no just ground for concluding. If Solomon could
not be described as "fairer than the children of men," as "a mighty warrior," as
"a victorious conqueror," as "a prince, whose throne is for ever and ever;"
&#8212; if the name "God" could not be applied to him; &#8212; if it could not
be said that his "children," in the room of their father, were made princes in
all the earth," (verse 16;) that "his name" "would be remembered in all
generations," and that "the people would praise him for ever and ever," (verse
17;) &#8212; if these things could not be spoken of him without much
incongruity, it may well be doubted whether the primary application of this
psalm is to him. Besides, although Solomon was a type of Christ, he was not so
in all things, and there is nothing in this poem, nor in any other part of
Scripture, which can lead us to regard the marriage of this prince with the
daughter of Pharaoh as an image or type of the mystical marriage of Jesus Christ
to the Church. We therefore agree with Rosenm&uuml;ller, that "the notion of
Rudinger and Grotius," and other critics, "that this song is an epithalamium
&#8212; a song in celebration of the marriage of Solomon, and his chief wife,
the daughter of Pharaoh,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;110305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 3:5,) is altogether to be abandoned;" and that it applies exclusively to
the Messiah, and to the mystical union between him and his Church; set forth in
an allegory borrowed from the manners of an Eastern court, and under the image
of conjugal love, he being represented as the bridegroom, and the Church as his
bride. &#8212; See

This is certainly a most important rule in interpreting the allegorical
compositions of Scripture. It is not to be imagined that there are distinct
analogies between every part of an allegorical representation, and the spiritual
subjects which it is designed to illustrate. The interpreter who allows his
ingenuity to press too closely all the points of the allegory to the spiritual
subjects couched under it, seeking points of comparison in the complementary
parts, which are introduced merely for the purpose of giving more animation and
beauty to the discourse, is in danger by his fanciful analogies of degrading the
composition, and falling into
absurdities.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb171

There is probably here an allusion to the ancient custom of collecting the arms

to an invading army, nor "the breaking in pieces of them" to an actual storm
which had this effect; but the sacred writer employs another figure, the more
vividly to describe the terror which seized upon these confederate powers. He
had in the preceding verse compared it with the pangs of a woman in travail; and
here he compares it to the trembling which seized upon mariners when the fury of
the east wind, which shattered in pieces the largest and strongest vessels, as
the ships of Tarshish probably then were, was let loose upon

Bythner and Fry are of opinion, that "the inclining of the ear" is a metaphor
taken from the position of the minstrel, who, in accommodating his words to the
tune, brings his ear close to the harp, that he may catch the sounds. Thus the

This word is of great latitude in its signification. It signifies primarily any
similitude by which another thing is expressed. Thence it comes to denote a
figurative discourse, either in the form of fiction and fable, such as riddles
or significant apologues, as that of Jotham,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;070907&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Judges
9:7, or in which application is made of some true example or similitude, as when
the sluggard is bidden "go to the ant," and the impenitent sinner to consider
the "swallow and crane," which return at their certain seasons, and so are
fitted to give a lesson to sinners to repent. And, finally, it belongs to all
moral doctrine, either darkly or sententiously delivered; wise men, in ancient
times, having been in the habit of delivering their lessons in short concise
sentences, sometimes in schemes and figures, and sometimes without them, as we
see in the Proverbs of Solomon, many of which are plain moral sayings without
any figure or comparison. Of this sort is that which is here introduced to our
attention; it is a moral theme not much veiled with figures, nor so concise as
proverbs usually are, but which contains the most instructive lessons on the
vanity of the prosperity of all wicked men. See Hammond <i>in

power of death; and the final triumph of all the suffering people of God over
their rich and haughty persecutors. This is indeed a dark theme to the

he was the author of the psalms which bear his name. These are twelve, the 50th,

these psalms differ very remarkably, both in style and subject, from those of
David, the composition being more stiff and obscure than the polished, flowing,

"The Targum, Kimchi, and R. Obediah Gaon, interpret this psalm of the day of
judgment, and Jarchi takes it to be a prophecy of the redemption by their future
Messiah." &#8212; <i>Dr Gill</i>.<i> </i>Dr Adam Clarke explains it in the first
of these senses; observing, that "to any minor consideration or fact it seems
impossible with any propriety to restrain it." It appears, however, as Calvin
holds, to be rather the aim and intention of the poem to teach the utter
uselessness of all outward ceremonies in the absence of inward piety; and it is
constructed on the plan of a dramatic performance, the sole actor being Jehovah
seated on his throne in Zion, and the audience being the whole world, who are
summoned to be witnesses of the judgment which he is to execute upon his people.
This is the view taken by Bishop Lowth in his Lectures on Sacred Poetry, volume
2, p. 235. Walford gives the same interpretation. "To interpret this passage,"
says he, "of the promulgation of the Gospel, as is done by Bishop Horne and
other expositors of this book, is for the sake of a favorite theory to confound
things that are distinct, and to throw obscurity over the whole, by which its
specific design is darkened, and the poem deprived of its consistency and unity.
The great purpose of the psalm is to deliver the judgment of God respecting the
Jewish people; and heaven and earth are summoned, as in

The manner in which covenants were anciently ratified by sacrifices was this:
The victim was cut into two parts, and each half was placed upon an altar. The
contracting parties then passed between the pieces, which was a kind of
imprecation upon the party who should violate the covenant, being as much as to
say, May he or they be cut asunder like that dissected victim. In this manner,
the covenant which God made with Abraham and his family was ratified,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011509&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
15:9, 17, 18. This awful ceremony was also observed by God's ancient people at

In explanation of this, Martin observes, "Le feu descendu du ciel," etc.;

was considered mystically as the mouth of God which devoured the flesh of the
victims; and it was on that account that God had expressly forbidden to consume

From the confession which David makes in this verse, "Against thee, thee
<i>only</i>,<i> </i>have I sinned," Horsley is of opinion that the title of the
psalm is not authentic, and that it could not have been composed on the occasion
to which the title refers. "It ill suits the case of David," says he, "who laid
a successful plot against Uriah after he had defiled his bed." But there seems
to be no force in this objection. The prefix
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lamed</i>,<i> </i>translated <i>against</i>, sometimes means
<i>before</i>,<i> in the presence of</i>, and is so rendered in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012311&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
23:11, and 45:1. The Hebrew words
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#176;rbl
&#176;l</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>lecha</i>,<i> lebaddecha</i>, may,
therefore be rendered, "before thee, before thee only." If this reading is
adopted, then, David alludes to the clandestine manner in which he committed the
sin, intimating that it was a secret sin witnessed by God only, and known in the
first instance only to him, God says of it, "For thou didst it secretly,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;101212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 12:12.) There is, however, no need to alter the translation to meet the
objection of Horsley. By these words, "Against thee, thee only,"<i> </i>David
does not mean to say that he had not wronged Uriah, whose wife he had
dishonored, whom he had caused to be made drunk, and afterwards to be slain; for
he acknowledges in the 14th verse that "blood-guiltiness" lay heavy upon him,
and he prays for deliverance from it. They are an emphatic declaration of the
heinousness of his guilt &#8212; that he had sinned chiefly against God &#8212;
more against him than against man. "My offense," as if he had said, "against
Uriah, and against society at large, great as it has been, is nothing compared
to that which I have committed against
thee."</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb262
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">This is the opinion of R. Abraham and other
Jewish commentators. They say that these words are not to be joined to the
immediately preceding part of this verse, but either to the prayer in the first
verse, or to what is stated in the third verse, "I acknowledge my
transgressions;" and they put the beginning of the fourth verse, "Against thee,
thee only, have I sinned, and done evil in thy sight," within a parenthesis. But
there is no just ground for such an interpretation. Green reads the last clause
of the verse, "So that thou art just in passing sentence <i>upon me</i>,<i>
</i>and clear in condemning <i>me</i>." And it is not uncommon for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;[ml</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>le-maan</i>,<i> </i>to be used in the sense of <i>so that</i>,<i> </i>as in

50:34. According to this reading, the words are a part of David's confession;
&#8212; he not only confesses his sin in the first part of the verse, but also
here acknowledges the divine righteousness should God condemn him. This is the
sense in which Calvin understands the
passage.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb263</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
There does not appear to be any substantial difference between the reading of
the Septuagint, which the apostle follows, and that of the Hebrew text. Calvin
says that Paul uses the verb <i>to judge </i>in a passive sense, whereas it is
here used actively. But this is a mistake. Street, after giving the words of the
Septuagint, which are, </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Nikhshv ejn
tw krinesqai se</font><font face="Palatino">, says, "The verb
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">krinesqai</font><font face="Palatino">
is in the middle, not in the passive voice, and the
phrase</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue"> ejn tw krinesqai
se</font><font face="Palatino">, signifies <i>cum tu judicas</i>,"<i>
</i>[<i>i</i>.<i>e</i>.<i> when thou judgest</i>.]<i> </i>"I take notice of this
the rather, because the passage being cited by Paul,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450304&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:4, (and the Septuagint version of it having been inserted instead of the
Hebrew, which the apostle quoted,) our translators seem to have mistaken the
sense of it; for they render it, 'That thou mightest be justified in thy
sayings, and mightest overcome <i>when thou art judged</i>.'<i> </i>But who
shall judge the Almighty?" In the other instance which Calvin mentions, the
difference between the apostle's reading and that of the Hebrew text is more in
appearance than in reality. "The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hkz</font><font face="Palatino">,"
says Hammond, "is ordinarily rendered <i>mundus fuit</i>,<i> clean</i>,<i>
</i>or <i>clear</i>,<i> </i>or <i>pure</i>.<i> </i>But this, as the context
evinces, must be understood in a forensic sense, as <i>pure </i>is all one with
<i>free from quilt</i>;<i> </i>and so there is a second notion of the word for
<i>overcoming</i>,<i> </i>meaning that sort of victory which belongs to him that
carries the cause in judicature." After stating that this is the rendering of
the Septuagint, he observes, "That is very reconcilable with the notion of
<i>mundus fuit</i>;<i> </i>for he that doth overcome in the suit is fitly said
to be <i>cleared </i>or quitted by the law." Thus Hammond, with Chrysostom,
supposes the meaning to be, that should God proceed against David, should he
indite and arraign him at the bar of justice for his sins, demanding vengeance
to be inflicted upon him, God would be justified and cleared, and would overcome
in the
suit.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb264</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

principally concerned, denotes the purity of the heart, the not admitting any
unclean desire or thought, the very first degree of indulgence to any lust. And

manifested to me the secret and hidden things of thy wisdom." Viewed in this
light as well as in the other, the language expresses the aggravated nature of
David's sin. He had sinned, although God had revealed to him high and secret
mysteries.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb267</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Hyssop was much used by the Hebrews in their sacred purifications and
sprinklings. The allusion here probably is to the ceremony of sprinkling such as
had been infected with leprosy. Two birds were to be taken, cedar wood, scarlet,
and hyssop; one of the birds was to be killed, and the priest having dipped the
living bird, the cedar wood, scarlet, and hyssop, in the blood of the bird that
was killed, sprinkled the leper, (Leviticus 14.) This ceremony, it is to be
observed, was not to be performed until the person was cured; and it was
intended as a declaration to the people, that, God having healed him of a
disease which no human means could remove, he might with safety be restored to
society, and to the privileges of which he had been deprived. David, polluted
with the crimes of adultery and murder, regarded himself as a man affected with
the dreadful disease of leprosy, and he prays that God would sprinkle him with
hyssop, as the leper was sprinkled, using this figurative language to express
his ardent desires to obtain forgiveness and cleansing by the application of the
blood of Christ, and that God would show to the people that he had pardoned his
sin, restored him to favor, and purified his
soul.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb268</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
David felt that he was stained, as it were, by the blood of Uriah, and therefore
he prays, "Wash me." The word

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">sbk</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cabas</i>,<i> to tread</i>,<i> to trample with the feet</i>;<i> </i>and hence
it signifies <i>to wash</i>,<i> to cleanse</i>,<i> </i>for example, garments, by

Bishop Mant, "are always used in the Hebrew language with the strictest
propriety: the one to signify that kind of washing which <i>pervades the
substance </i>of the thing washed, and cleanses it thoroughly; and the other to
express that kind of washing which only <i>cleanses the surface </i>of a
substance, which the water cannot penetrate. The former is applied to the
washing of clothes; the latter is used for washing some part of the body. By a
beautiful and strong metaphor, David uses the former word in this and the second
verse: '<i>Wash </i>me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my
sin.' '<i>Wash </i>me, and I shall be whiter than snow.' So in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240414&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
4:14, the same word is applied to the heart. There is a similar distinction in

Hebrew words above alluded
to."</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb269</font></sup><font face="Palatino">French

Some commentators refer the clause, upon which Calvin is here commenting, to the
Holy Spirit, and others to the qualities of mind with which David desired to be
endued. The translators of our English Bible understand the expression in the
first sense, reading, "thy free Spirit." The word <i>thy </i>is a supplement,
but it does not appear to be liable to any material objection. Fry, who adopts
the same view, reads, "bountiful or spontaneously flowing Spirit;" and observes,
that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hbydn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nedibah</i>,<i> </i>"is more still than spontaneously flowing:<i> </i>it
signifies to flow both spontaneously and plentifully: 'prae uberitate succi
sponte fluens.' This epithet of the indwelling Spirit will be best explained
from our Lord's own words,
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430414&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
4:14, and 7:38." Others refer the expression to the mind of the Psalmist. Mudge
reads, "And let a plentiful effusion of spirit support me." Dimock, "Let a free
spirit sustain me;" "that is," says he, "let me not be enslaved, as I have been,
by my sinful passions." Green, "And support with a cheerful spirit." French and
Skinner, "And may a willing spirit uphold me;" by which they understand, "a
spirit devoted to the service of God." Walford, following the Septuagint, reads,
"And with a princely spirit sustain me." "David," says this critic, "was so
overwhelmed by the consciousness of his extreme iniquity, so broken in spirit,
courage, and fortitude, as to feel altogether incompetent to the discharge of
his office, as the King of Israel. He therefore addresses this petition to God,
in the hope that he would grant to him a renewal of that powerful energy by
which he had at first been fitted for an employment so every way unsuitable to
his lowly descent, and his employment as a
shepherd."</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb271</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This opinion, although disapproved of by our Author, is very generally held by
commentators. When <i>blood </i>is used in the plural number as here, it usually
denotes murder or manslaughter, and the guilt following thereupon: as in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis

5:6; 26:9; 59:2; and 55:23. David's conduct towards Uriah, forming as it did a
dark and an atrocious deed of treachery and cruelty which has few parallels in
the history of mankind, must, on his recovery to a sense of its real character,
have inflicted on his soul an agony which cannot be told. He escaped being tried
before an earthly tribunal; but his conscience told him that he stood at the bar
of Heaven, laden with the guilt of murder; and he was convinced that the mercy
of God alone could pardon him and purify his conscience. No wonder then that he
cries out with such emphasis and earnestness, <i>O</i> <i>God</i>!<i> thou God
of my salvation</i>!<i> deliver me</i>!<i> </i>The Chaldee reads, "Deliver me

There may be another reason why David here affirms that God would not accept of
a sacrifice, nor be pleased with a burnt-offering. No particular sacrifices were
appointed by the Law of Moses to expiate the guilt of murder and adultery. The
person who had perpetrated these crimes was, according to the Divine law, to be
punished with death. David therefore may be understood as declaring, that it was
utterly vain for him to think of resorting to sacrifices and burnt-offerings
with a view to the expiation of his guilt; that his criminality was of such a
character, that the ceremonial law made no provision for his deliverance from
the doom which his deeds of horror deserved; and that the only sacrifices which
would avail were those mentioned in the succeeding verse, "The sacrifices of a
broken
heart."</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb274</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
We have already considered Horsley's first objection, founded on the fourth
verse, to the authenticity of the title of this psalm. His second and only other
objection rests on the 18th verse. He thinks that the prayer, "Build thou the
walls of Jerusalem," is more applicable to the time of the Babylonish captivity
than to the time of David; and to the former period he refers the psalm. Calmet
and Mudge are of the same opinion. Some learned Jewish interpreters, while they
assign the psalm to the occasion mentioned in the title, conjecture that the
18th and 19th verses were added by some Jewish bard in the time of the
Babylonish captivity. This opinion is also held by Venema, Green, Street, French
and Skinner. There does not, however, seem to be any sufficient ground for
referring the poem, either in whole or in part, to that period. Neither the
walls of Jerusalem, nor the buildings of Zion, as the royal palace, and the
magnificent structure of the temple, which we know David had already
contemplated for the worship of God,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;100701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 7:1, etc.) were completed during his reign. This was only effected under
the reign of his son Solomon,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;110301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 3:1.) The prayer, then, in the 18th verse, might have a particular
reference to the completion of these buildings, and especially to the rearing of
the temple, in which sacrifices of unprecedented magnitude were to be offered.
David's fears might easily suggest to him that his crimes might prevent the
building of the temple which God had promised should be erected,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;100713&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 7:13.) "The king forgets not," observes Bishop Horne, "to ask mercy for
his people, as well as for himself; that so neither his own nor their sins might
prevent either the building and flourishing of the earthly Jerusalem, or, what
was of infinitely greater importance, the promised blessing of Messiah, who was
to descend from him, and to rear the walls of the New
Jerusalem."</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb275</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Ainsworth reads, "the burnt-offering and the whole oblation;" and observes, that
"<i>The</i> <i>whole oblation</i>,<i> the calil</i>,<i> </i>was a kind of
oblation that was wholly and every whit given up in fire unto God, and differed
from the <i>ghnola</i>,<i> </i>or burnt-offering, which was only of beasts or
birds, Leviticus 1; whereas the <i>calil </i>was also of flour, called the
meat-offering, but burned altogether, which the common meat-offerings were
not,<i>

Samuel 21:1-7, and 22:9-19. It affords a strong evidence of the hatred which
Saul bore to David, and of his savage cruelty to order the execution of
eighty-five priests for no crime; and what a monster of iniquity must Doeg have
been, who executed this command when not another individual in all Saul's
company would do it, and who, in addition to this, "smote the city of the
priests with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings,
and oxen, and asses, and sheep?" "If we are confounded," says Walford, "by the
savage ferocity of a prince who could order the execution of eighty-five persons
of most venerable station, for a crime which existed alone in his disturbed
imagination, we shall feel disposed to execrate the ruthless villain who could
imbrue his hands in the blood of so many innocent victims; and we shall be ready
to draw the conclusion, that both Saul and Doeg were prompted to this deed of
atrocious cruelty, not merely by their hatred of David, but by a malevolence,
almost without parallel, against the ministers of religion, and which rendered
conspicuous their contempt and hatred for God himself. It can excite little
surprise to find David saying, as he does, in the next psalm, 'The fool saith in

<i>yachtecha</i>,<i> </i>Bythner explains, "<i>will</i> <i>snatch thee

There is another interpretation of this expression which may here be stated. It
has been thought that the allusion is to God's tabernacle.
"</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lham</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
meohel</i>,"<i> </i>says Hammond, "is literally 'from the tabernacle,' not 'from

'from the tabernacle;' and though the Latin, and Syriac, and Arabic, have added
<i>tuo</i>,<i> thy</i>,<i> </i>yet neither will the Hebrew bear, nor do the
Chaldee acknowledge it, who read by way of paraphrase, 'He shall cause thee to
depart from inhabiting in the place of the Schechina, or tabernacle, the place
of God's presence.'" Hammond supposes that the expression is to be understood
"of the censure of excommunication, which in the last and highest degree was
<i>Schammatha</i>,<i> </i>delivering up the offender to the hand of heaven to be
cut off, himself and his posterity." "Doeg," says Archbishop Secker, "had no
office in the tabernacle; but it seems, by his history, that he frequented it,
which he might do to seem a good man. And there seems an opposition between his
being plucked out of God's dwelling-place, and David's continuing in the house
of God, verse
eighth."</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb281</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
French and Skinner read, "The righteous shall see it, and feel reverence;
&#8212; <i>feel reverence</i>,<i> i</i>.<i>e</i>., in the punishment of this
wicked man, find additional reason to reverence God, and to observe his
righteous
laws."</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb282</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
If this is the true rendering, there may be a reference to the expectations
which Doeg had entertained of increasing his power and influence by maliciously
injuring David, as he would thereby obtain, in a high degree, the favor of
Saul.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb283</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This is the marginal reading in our English Bible. As he was Saul's chief
herdsman, it is probable that his riches consisted chiefly in
cattle.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb284</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Our English Bible also reads, "like a green olive-tree;" but it would be more
correct to translate, "I am like a flourishing, or vigorous olive-tree." The
original word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;n[r</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>raanan</i>, has no reference to the color of the tree, but to its fresh,
vigouous and flourish condition. Hence this word is used, in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;199211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
92:11, to express "<i>fresh </i>oil;" and in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;270404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
4:4, to denote the prosperous condition of Nebuchadnezzar, "I was at rest in
mine house, and <i>flourishing</i> in my palace." The fact is, that the color of
the olive-tree, so far from being of a bright and lively green, is dark,
disagreeable, and yellowish. Travellers, when they have seen this tree, have
experienced a feeling of disappointment in not finding it to possess the vivid
verdure which they had been led to expect from the description given of it in
the Scriptures. An excellent English traveler, Mr Sharpe, writing from Italy,
thus expresses himself on this subject: "The fields, and indeed the whole face
of Tuscany, are in a manner covered with olive-trees; but the olive-tree does
not answer the character I had conceived of it. The royal Psalmist, and some of
the sacred writers, speak with rapture of the 'green olive-tree,' so that I
expected a beautiful green; and I confess to you I was wretchedly disappointed
to find its hue resembling that of our hedges when they are covered with dust."
But this disappointment which Mr Sharpe felt arose not from overcharged or
exaggerated colouring on the part of the sacred writers, but from his not
understanding the meaning of their language. The beauty of the olive-tree is
represented in other parts of Scripture as consisting, not in the greenness of
its foliage, but in the spread of its branches,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;281406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
14:6.) <i>&#8212; Harmer</i>'<i>s Observations</i>,<i> volume </i>3, pp.
255-257. The propriety and beauty of the comparison which David here makes
appears from the fact that the olive is an evergreen, and is also, considering
its size, long-lived. While, in the 5th verse, he had predicted the speedy and
total destruction of Doeg, comparing him to a tree plucked up by the roots, he,
in contrast with this, represents himself as like a young, vigorous olive-tree,
which had long to live and flourish; confidently expecting to obtain that
outward peace and prosperity which God had promised him, and, along with this,
the enjoyment of all spiritual
blessings.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb285</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Some slight differences will be found, on comparison, between this and the 14th
psalm; the chief of which is in the 5th verse. For Calvin's explanation of this
verse, see volume 1, p. 199. It is not easy to say whether these variations are
owing to transcribers, or whether they were made by some prophetic bard, who,
during some afflictive period of Jewish history, adapted the 14th psalm, by a
few alterations, to circumstances different from those for which it was
originally composed. Theodoret is of this last opinion, and refers it to the
alarm created by Sennacherib's invasion under the reign of Hezekiah; others
think it was written during the captivity &#8212; a conjecture which is founded
on the last verse, "O that the salvation of Israel were come out of
Zion!"</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb286</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;061524&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joshua
15:24,) and therefore not, strictly speaking, "strangers," some think that
<i>the proud </i>is the true reading. But the Ziphites, as our Author justly
observes, may be called "strangers," because they acted towards David the part
of strangers and enemies, in seeking to deliver him into the hands of his unjust
and cruel persecutor,
Saul.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb290</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Ainsworth reads, "Daunting tyrants." "<i>Terrible dismayers</i>,<i> </i>as Saul
and his retinue, whose terror daunted many. See
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191018&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
10:18."</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb291</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The translators of our English Bible have supposed an ellipsis here; and hence
they supply "only desire." Calvin, in his translation of the verse, makes no
supplement, but understands it in a similar sense, "My eye hath seen punishment
upon my adversaries;" just as it is said in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;199108&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
91:8, "With thine eyes shalt thou behold and see <i>the reward </i>of the
wicked." But if we read the words literally, without any supplement, and as they
are rendered by the LXX. and the Syriac, "My eyes beheld, or looked upon mine
enemies," they will be susceptible of a very good and natural meaning. David's
enemies were not at this time destroyed; but Saul, when he had reached the
farther side of the mountain where David lay concealed, and was about to seize
his victim, having heard that the Philistines invaded the land, hastened in
confusion to repel the invaders. The meaning of David's language, therefore, may
be, that he was so near Saul and his army as to behold them marching away, which
may be easily conceived, when it is considered that "Saul went on this side of
the mountain Maon, and David and his men on that side of the mountains" (1
Samuel.

The phrase, </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ykmsb
ynda</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>Adonai besomkey</i>,<i> </i>which Calvin
renders, "The Lord is with them that uphold," is translated by Hammond, "The
Lord among the sustainers;" and he remarks, that this form of expression, which
is not unusual among the Hebrews, signifies no more than "God is my upholder;
not one of many upholders, but my only upholder." Thus, when Jephtha
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;071135&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Judges
11:35) tells his daughter, "Thou art among the troublers of me," or "one of them

him. So

55:18, "There were many with me;" <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., "God was with me," which
is as good as the greatest multitude. This is the sense in which the learned
Castellio understands the passage, rendering it, "Dominus is est qui mihi vitam
sustentat;" "The Lord is he who sustains my life;" and he defends it by the
above and like arguments. With this the Septuagint agrees:
"</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Kuriov ajntilh&gt;ptwr th~v

flight of the dove, is continued in the two following verses. The
defenselessness of the dove, the danger to which it is exposed from birds of
prey, the surprising rapidity with which, when pursued by the hawk, it flees to
deserts and rocks to hide itself, putting forth its utmost speed, and
outstripping its deadly pursuer; all these characteristics of this bird were in
the view of the Psalmist on the present occasion. We find an allusion to them in

48:28: "O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be

other birds, that while they become weary with flying, and alight upon a rock or

alternately rests one wing, and flies with the other, and, by this means,
escapes from the swiftest pursuers."<i> &#8212;</i> (<i>Paxton</i>'<i>s

Whirlwinds are not uncommon in Palestine, and the surrounding countries, and to
them we often find allusions in the Sacred Writings. The description of that
kind of whirlwind called the Sammiel, which sometimes happens between Egypt and
Nubia, will serve to show the propriety with which David made this allusion in
his present circumstances of distress and danger. "This wind, which the Arabs
call poisonous, stifles on the spot those that are unfortunate enough to breathe
in it: so that to guard against its pernicious effects, they are obliged to
throw themselves speedily on the ground, with their face close to these burning
sands, with which they are surrounded, and to cover their heads with some cloth
or carpet, lest, in respiration, they should suck in that deadly quality which
everywhere attends it. People ought even to think themselves very happy when
this wind, which is always besides very violent, does not raise up large
quantities of sand with a whirling motion, which, darkening the air, render the
guides incapable of discerning their way. Sometimes whole caravans have been
buried by this means under the sand, with which this wind is frequently
charged." &#8212; Maillet, quoted in <i>Harmer</i>'<i>s Observations</i>,<i>

Hare, Green, and others, conjecture that the first verb in the verse, "destroy,"

watch over the city; going their rounds upon the walls to guard "labor, sorrow,

fine specimen of that power of personification, or enduing general and abstract
ideas with personal qualities; and thus introducing them acting and speaking

very evil course, and fear not the sight of God, shall perish." Dathe, while he
admits the ambiguity of the word, follows the Chaldee. Gesenius gives the same
interpretation. "But," says Walford, "this reduces the passage nearly to an
identical proposition; so that the probable meaning is, vicissitudes of fortune.
These men had enjoyed great prosperity, and been subjected to few trials; they
were therefore enamoured of this world and its pleasures, and gave themselves
little regard about the will and authority of God. See

receive from God, whether of prosperity or adversity, it is our duty to refer it
back to him: 'He that giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord, and he will repay

Some think that there is here an allusion to an ancient custom of putting the
tears of mourners into lachrymal urns or bottles. In the Roman tombs there are
found small vials, or bottles of glass or pottery, usually called
<i>ampulloe</i>,<i> </i>or <i>urnoe lachrymales</i>,<i> </i>which, it has been
supposed, contained tears shed by the surviving relatives and friends, and were
deposited in the sepulchres of the deceased as memorials of affection and
sorrow. If in this passage there is a reference to this custom, it must have
existed at an early period among the Hebrews. It may however be doubted, whether
there is any such allusion. "It is only a modern conjecture that these bottles
'found in the Roman tombs' have been deposited there for such a purpose, and
there is no trace of such a custom in ancient writings or sculptures. Some think
they were intended to contain the perfumes used in sprinkling the funeral pile.
On some of them there is the representation of one or two eyes, and this seems
to favor the former view."<i> &#8212; Illustrated Commentary on the

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dan</font><font face="Palatino">,

oil. Compare

tears shed by him during his own sufferings, seems a very different thing from
the offering up of the tears of surviving relations or friends, as memorials on
the tomb of a deceased person." The expression, "Put thou my tears into thy
bottle," may be viewed as simply meaning, Let not my tears fall unnoticed; let
my distress and the tears which it has wrung from me be ever before thee, excite
thy compassion, and plead with thee to grant me relief. As the choicest things,
such as wine and milk, were put into bottles, the Psalmist may also be
understood as praying that his tears might not only be noted by God, but prized
by him. The

"</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">e]dwken eijv

peculiarly fierce and dangerous. "Nor need we wonder," he observes, "that the
lioness is reckoned among the fiercest lions; for the lioness equals, or even

fierce, and raging persons, that flamed with wrath and envy, and inflamed
others. Of such David did complain to Saul, 1 Samuel. 24:40." French and Skinner
read, "<i>men</i> <i>of fiery spirit</i>;<i> </i>and observe, that the Hebrew is
<i>flaming sons of men</i>,<i> i</i>.<i>e</i>.,<i> </i>violent men urging on my

This psalm consists of two parts. The preceding verses, which contain the first
part, express deep distress and extreme danger, and are of a plaintive and
imploring strain. But here, where the second part commences, there is an elegant
transition suddenly made to the language of exultation and triumph, which
continues to the close of the
psalm.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb346</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Hammond reads, "I will awaken the morning." Dr Geddes, Archbishop Secker,
Street, and Fry, give a similar version. "The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jry[a</font><font face="Palatino">,"
says Street, "is in the Hiphil conjugation; and therefore transitive; and the
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rj&ccedil;h</font><font face="Palatino">
is the objective case after it." As to translating
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rj&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,

and he observes, that "'I will awaken the morning' is more grammatical and
poetical." A similar thought frequently occurs in poetry. Thus Ovid says, "Non
vigil ales ibi cristati cantibus oris evocat auroram." "The cock by crowing
calls not up the morning there." And in Milton's Allegro we meet with the

That the serpent tribe may be charmed is a well-attested fact, and one of the
most curious and interesting in natural history. It is often mentioned by the
Greek and Roman classics, by Hebrew and Arabic writers; to the last of whom the
different species of serpents were well known. It is also supported by the
testimony of many modern travelers. Some serpents are delighted with the sounds
of vocal and instrumental music, and by it may be disarmed of their fury and
rendered innoxious,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;211011&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ecclesiastes
10:11.) In the East it is not uncommon to make use of pipes, flutes, whistles,
or small drums, to draw them from their hiding-places and to subdue their
ferocity; and when they are tame ones, the charmer makes them dance and keep
time with the notes of music, twists them round his body, and handles them
without any harm, although the fangs are not broken or extracted. But in some
cases the charmer's art fails; and, notwithstanding his incantations, the

with its poisoned fangs, a deadly wound,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240817&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
8:17.) In this case it "will not listen to the voice of the charmer." It is not
necessary to suppose that the "deaf adder" means a species of serpent naturally
deaf, and which it is impossible for the charmer ever to fascinate. Nothing more
may be meant but that his incantations sometimes fail of success; that some
adders are so stubborn that the sound of music makes no impression upon them;
and they are like creatures who are destitute of hearing, or whose ears are
stopped. The manner in which the "deaf adder stoppeth its ear" is described by
Lochart to be this: &#8212; "The reptile lays one ear close to the ground, and
with its tail covers the other, that it cannot hear the sound of the music; or
it repels the incantation by hissing violently." So impenetrable are the wicked
here represented to be to persuasion: they will not be wrought upon to forsake
their wicked courses, and gained to the ways of God, by his most persuasive
entreaties.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb352</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The power which charmers had over serpents was probably ascribed by them to the
agency of invisible beings, although it might be the natural effect of the music
which they
used.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb353</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
There is nothing in the original for, "Let their arrows be;" it is a supplement
made by Calvin in the French version. There is some difficulty in the last
member of the verse. Many interpreters refer it to God, who bends his bow
against the ungodly. This agrees with the Septuagint, Vulgate, Chaldee, Syriac,
and Arabic versions. But Symmachus and others refer it to ungodly men, who
study, indeed, to hurt the godly, but without effect. "This seems," says Dathe,
"to be the most natural connection: in the 6th verse the sacred writer addresses
God himself in the second person; and there is here described the unsuccessful
issue of the endeavors of the wicked against the righteous." "I am persuaded,"
says Rogers, "that some word, the name of something with which the wicked,
perishing under the Divine vengeance, were compared, is lost in the Hebrew."<i>

"Break their teeth in their mouth" is most probably a continuation of the
metaphorical illustration taken from serpents and adders immediately before,
whose poison is contained in a bag at the bottom of one of their teeth, and who
are disarmed by being deprived of this tooth which conveys the poison. This the
charmer sometimes does after he has brought them out of their retreats by music.
When the serpent makes its appearance, he seizes it by the throat, draws it
forth, shows its poisoned fangs, and beats them out. To this beating out there
seems to be here an allusion. "This mention of teeth," says Hammond, "fairly
introduces that which follows concerning the lion, whose doing mischief with
that part is more violent and formidable, and so signifies the open, riotous
invader, the violent and lawless person; as the serpent's teeth, the more
secret, indiscernible wounds of the whisperer or backbiter, which yet are as
dangerous and destructive as the former, by the smallest puncture killing him on
whom they
fasten."</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb356</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

eminently destructive, and has not unfrequently been known to entomb and destroy
whole caravans. Sidi Hamet, describing his journey across the great desert to
Tombuctoo with a caravan consisting of above one thousand men and four thousand
camels, relates that, "after travelling upwards of a month they were attacked by
the Shume, the burning blast of the desert, carrying with it clouds of sand.
They were obliged to lie for two days with their faces on the ground, only
lifting them occasionally to shake off the sand and obtain breath. Three hundred

</i>From the great attention which is paid to external purity in the East, and
in consequence of dogs being reckoned unclean, as they were by the Jews under
the law, the inhabitants do not admit them into their houses, and even carefully
avoid touching them in their streets, by which they would consider themselves
defiled. But though not there domesticated as with us, dogs are to be found in
great numbers, and crowd the streets. They are not attached to any particular
person or family, nor accounted the property of any one; and though it is not
uncommon for some of the inhabitants, from motives of superstition, to give
money weekly or monthly to butchers and bakers to feed them at stated times, and
though some even leave legacies at their death for the same purpose, yet they
must necessarily subsist in a great measure on what they can seize or steal;
and, being very numerous, they are perpetually wandering about in large troops
seeking for something to devour.<i> &#8212; </i>(<i>Harmer</i>'<i>s
Observations</i>,<i> volume</i> 1, p. 344.) To these circumstances the Psalmist
clearly alludes in the 14th and 15th verses, when he compares the behavior of
his enemies to that of dogs. He repeats what he had said in the 5th verse; but
here he intends to convey a different idea. "Let them do what they may;" as if

The three first verses, which complain of calamities and distresses, seem not to

otherwise very ingenious and plausible; and this change would make each psalm
more consistent, and reconcile this psalm to its title very well; for the
historical books mention no distress in the war to which the title refers." Dr
Adam Clarke considers this conjecture well founded; but others think the
apparent discrepancy may be removed by supposing that the psalm was written
after some of the battles of which mention is made in the title, and that the
Author does not restrict himself to those events, but takes in a wider range, so
as to embrace the afflictive condition both of Israel and Judah during the
latter part of Saul's life, and the former years of David's
reign.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb384</font></sup>

Hamer has given a very ingenious explanation of this passage, derived from the
manners of the East. "It seems," says he, "that the modern Eastern people have
looked upon the giving them a <i>banner </i>as a more sure pledge of protection
'than that given by words.' So Albertus Aquensis tell us, that when Jerusalem
was taken in 1099, about three hundred Saracens got upon the roof of a very
lofty building, and earnestly begged for quarter, but could not be induced, by
any promises of safety, to come down, until they had received the banner of
Tancred [one of the chiefs of the Crusade army] as a pledge of life. It did not,
indeed, avail them, as that historian observes; for their behavior occasioned
such indignation that they were destroyed to a man. The event showed the
faithlessness of these zealots, whom no solemnities could bind; but the Saracens
surrendering themselves upon the delivery of a standard to them, proves in what
a strong light they looked upon the giving them a banner; since it induced them
to trust it when they would not trust any promises. Perhaps the delivery of a
banner was anciently esteemed, in like manner, an obligation to protect, and the
Psalmist might consider it in this light, when, upon a victory gained over the
Syrians and Edomites, after the public affairs of Israel had been in a bad
state, he says, 'Thou hast showed thy people hard things, etc.; thou hast given
a banner to them that fear thee.' Though thou didst for a time give up thine
Israel into the hands of their enemies, thou hast now given them an assurance of
thy having received them under thy protection."<i> &#8212; Observations</i>,<i>
volume </i>3, pp. 496, 497. Harmer supposes that our translation, which speaks
of <i>a banner displayed</i>,<i> </i>is inaccurate; observing, that it is most
probable that the Israelites anciently used only a spear, properly ornamented to
distinguish it from a common one &#8212; a supposition which he founds on the
fact, that a very long spear, covered all over with silver, and having a ball of
gold on the top, was the standard of the Egyptian princes at the time of the
Crusade wars, and was carried before their armies. He proposes to read, "Thou
hast given an ensign or standard
[</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;n</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nes</i>]<i> </i>to them that fear thee, that it may be lifted up." But
Parkhurst considers the radical meaning of the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;n</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nes</i>,<i> </i>to be <i>a banner </i>or <i>ensign</i>,<i> </i>from its

Mant's explanation of the phrase is similar to that of Calvin. "In this place,"
says he, "it may mean no more than that God had united his people under one
head, and so enabled them to meet their enemies by repairing to the standard of
their sovereign." "The banner, or standard of an army," says Walford, "is the
object of constant attention to soldiers: so long as it is safe, and elevated,
so long courage, hope, and energy, are maintained. The poet uses this symbol to
express his hope that God Himself would be the source of their valor and

Shechem lay in Samaria, and, therefore, by it the whole of Samaria may be
intended. The valley of Succoth, or booths, received its name from Jacob's
making booths, and feeding his cattle there. (See

whole of that district of country. Though Samaria, and the country beyond the
Jordan, were now in the hands of the enemy, yet David anticipates the time when
he would gain complete and absolute possession of them, which he expresses by
<i>dividing</i>,<i> </i>and <i>meting them out</i>.<i> </i>The allusion is to
the dividing and measuring out of land; and it was a part of the power of a king
to distribute his kingdom into cities and provinces, and to place judges and

This office of washing the feet was in the East commonly performed by slaves,
and the meanest of the family, as appears from what Abigail said to David when
he took her to wife, "Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet
of the servants of my lord," 1 Samuel. 25:41; and from the fact of our Savior
washing his disciples' feet, to give them an example of humility,

</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">podoniptron</font><font face="Palatino">,
the term which the Greeks, in strict propriety of speech, applied to a vessel
for washing the feet. As this office was servile, so the vessels employed for
this purpose were a mean part of household stuff. Gataker and Le Clerc
illustrate this text from an anecdote related by Herodotus, concerning Amasis,
king of Egypt, who expressed the meanness of his own origin by comparing himself
to a pot for washing the feet in, (Herod., Lib. 2, c. 172.)<i> </i>When,
therefore, it is said, 'Moab is my washing-pot,' the complete and servile
subjection of Moab to David is strongly marked. This is expressed not by
comparing Moab to a slave who performs the lowest offices, as presenting to his
master the basin for washing his feet, but by comparing him to the mean utensil
itself. See

Edom or Idumea was inhabited by the Edomites, or posterity of Edom, that is,
Esau, (the elder brother of Jacob,) who, on account of his profanity in selling
his birthright for a mess of red pottage &#8212; called in Hebrew <i>Edom</i>
&#8212; had this name imposed upon him to the perpetual disgrace of himself and
his posterity,

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
12:16.) The expression, "Over Edom will I cast my shoe," has been differently
explained by interpreters. Some, as Gataker and Martin, read, "To Edom will I
cast my shoe;" and suppose that the reference is to the custom which then
prevailed, of the master employing his meanest servant to untie, take off, and
cleanse his shoes,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400311&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
3:11;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;420316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
3:16 ;) and that David intimates, that the Edomites would become his menial
slaves, who would perform to him the lowest offices. "And the prophet," observes
Martin, "uses the word <i>throw</i>,<i> </i>which marks an action done in a
passionate and angry manner, in allusion to the circumstance that masters, when
employing their servants with whom they are displeased to take off their shoes,
hold out their feet to them with violence, as if they would thrust their feet
against them." The LXX. and Vulgate read, "will extend my shoe." And Bishop
Horne is of opinion, that the meaning is, "extending his shoe," that is to say,
putting his feet upon them; and this, it is well known, was the manner in which
Eastern conquerors were wont to treat their captives. But there is another
ancient custom to which others suppose the passage refers. The ancients were
wont to throw their shoes and sandals, when soiled with dirt, into some obscure
corner before they sat down to meat, and many might possibly have some mean
place in their houses into which they commonly threw them; and, therefore, the
throwing of the shoe <i>over </i>or <i>on </i>Edom might mean, as Bucer expounds
it, "Edom will be as the place into which I cast my shoe." But whatever may be
the precise allusion, the meaning conveyed undoubtedly is, that David would make
a complete conquest of Edom, that he would reduce it to the lowest subjection.

Literally, "the strong city," or "the city of strength." The Chaldee makes it
Tyre, the capital of Phoenicia. Mudge and others think Petra, the capital of

out of the rock, and deemed impregnable, (Obadiah, 3d verse,) and with which
Burckhardt, Laborde, Stephens, and other modern travelers, have made us so
minutely acquainted; the language of the Psalmist is very appropriate,
illustrating the strength of his faith, and magnifying the greatness of the
divine aid. <i>Who will bring me into the fortified city</i>?<i> </i>it is
impossible for me, by my own strength, or by mere human aid, to occupy this

Israel when they were marching out to that battle, triumphantly commemorating
their former victories, and avowing their hopes of gaining another by the help
of the Almighty. On this verse he observes: "it was a constant practice among
the bravest nations of the Greeks, for the troops to advance to battle chanting
some kind of song." And, after quoting some lines which were sung by the Spartan
soldiery, he adds, "The Grecian poet avails himself of the love of glory, and
the ties of domestic affection, to animate his troops; but the Hebrew makes use
of the more powerful stimulus of religious
enthusiasm."</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb402</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

The import of the Hebrew word is "patient silence." The Septuagint reads,

submissive, and subject; the rebellious affections being tamed and subdued. With
respect to the translation of our English Bible, "Truly my soul waiteth upon
God," Dr Adam Clarke remarks, "I do not think that the original will warrant
this translation." He reads, "Surely to God only is my soul dumb;" which he thus
explains: "I am subject to God Almighty. He has a right to lay on me what He
pleases; and what He lays on me is much less than I deserve; therefore am <i>I
dumb </i>before God. The Vulgate, and, almost all the versions, have understood
it in this sense: 'Nonne Deo subjecta erit anima mea? Shall not my soul be

Hammond observes, that this verb "is but once used in the Scriptures, and so
will not be easily interpreted but either by the notion which we find put upon

<i>instigate</i>,<i> incite</i>,<i> </i>or<i> provoke</i>;<i> </i>the Septuagint
and Vulgate, <i>assail</i>,<i> </i>or <i>rush upon</i>;<i> </i>and the Arabic,

Septuagint. Kimchi and Aben Ezra read, <i>pravitatis cogitabitis</i>.<i>

In the East it is common for the inhabitants to enclose their vineyards and
gardens with hedges, consisting of various kinds of shrubs, and particularly
such as are armed with spines. They have also mounds of earth-walls about their
gardens. Rawwolff describes the gardens about Jerusalem as surrounded by
mud-walls, not above four feet high, easily climbed over, and washed down by
rain in a very little time. Stone-walls are also frequently used. Thus Egmont or
Heyman, describing the country about Saphet, a celebrated city of Galilee, tells
us, "The country round it is finely improved, the declivity being covered with
vines, supported by low walls. <i>&#8212; Harmer</i>'<i>s Observations</i>,<i>

David was often compelled to flee into the remote deserts which lay in the tribe
of Judah, to escape the fury of Saul. In tracing his steps, when eagerly sought

Saul's lifetime, though he was not acknowledged to be sovereign by any tribe

the lifting up of men's hands in prayer as an emblematical acknowledging of the

islands," an appellation very vague and indeterminate. At the same time, it is
highly probable that <i>shual </i>generally refers to the jackal. Several of the
modern oriental names of this animal, as the Turkish <i>chical</i>,<i> </i>and
the Persian <i>sciagal</i>,<i> sciachal</i>,<i> </i>or <i>schachal &#8212;
</i>whence the English jackal &#8212; from their resemblance to the Hebrew word
<i>shual</i>,<i> </i>favor this supposition; and Dr Shaw, and other travelers,
inform us, that while jackals are very numerous in Palestine, the common fox is
rarely to be met with. We shall, therefore, be more correct, under these
circumstances, in admitting that the jackal of the East is the Hebrew
<i>shual</i>.<i> </i>These animals never go alone, but always associate in packs
of from fifty to two hundred. They are known to prey on dead bodies; and so
greedy are they of human carcases, that they dig them out of their graves, and
devour them, however putrescent They have been seen waiting near the grave at
the time of a funeral eagerly watching their opportunity of digging up the body
almost as soon as it was buried. "I have known several instances," says a
traveler quoted by Merrick, "of their attacking and devouring drunken men, whom
they have found lying on the road, and have heard that they will do the same to
men that are sick and helpless. I have seen many graves that have been opened by
the jackals, and parts of the bodies pulled out by them." They visit the field
of battle to prey upon the dying and the dead, and they follow caravans for the
same purpose. It is usual with the barbarous nations of the East to leave the
bodies of their enemies, killed in battle, in the field, to be devoured by
jackals and other animals. When the Psalmist, therefore, says that his enemies
would become <i>a portion for foxes</i>,<i> </i>the meaning is, that they would
be denied the rites of sepulture, which was deemed a great calamity, &#8212;
that they should be left unburied, for jackals and other wild beasts to prey
upon and
devour.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb439</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

him that all Israel were willing to make peace with him; but Hezekiah would not

6:4, to have been of very ancient use in Arabia. They were also used by many
other nations in different parts of the world. Homer says of Ulysses, that he
went to Ephyre, a city of Thessaly, in order to procure deadly poison for
smearing his deadly-pointed arrows, Odyssey, Lib. 1, 50, 335-345. Virgil
describes one of his heroes as eminently skillful in anointing the dart, and
arming its steel with poison, Aen. Lib. 9, 50, 771. And Horace mentions the
<i>venenatoe sagittoe</i>,<i> the poisoned arrows </i>of the ancient Moors in
Africa, Lib. 1, Ode 22, 50, 3. Wherever this practice has prevailed, the poison
employed has been of the most deadly kind, the slightest wound being followed by
certain and almost instant death. This makes the language here strikingly
expressive. David compares the calumnies his enemies launched against him to
poisoned
arrows.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb442</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

The title of this psalm does not inform us on what particular occasion it was
written. Mudge is of opinion that it was "composed by a person just come to
Jerusalem from some very distant parts, where, upon his prayers and vows, he had
been signally delivered from the fury of the sea, and uproar of the natives;
which leads him into a general acknowledgement of the Divine Providence which
extended itself to the end of the earth." It is thought by others to be a
thanksgiving to God for having graciously sent to the land of Judea a copious
rain, after it had been previously suffering from the effects of a
long-continued drought; and that it probably relates to the three years of
famine that followed some time after the rebellion of Absalom, (2 Samuel 21)
which, being alleviated by some plenteous showers of rain, called forth this
hymn of thanksgiving. Dr Morrison supposes that David wrote it for the feast of
tabernacles, as it seems to contain an expression of public thanksgiving for the
fruits of the earth, which had been safely gathered in. All these, however, are
only conjectures. Nor is it material for us to know the occasion of its
composition, embracing, as it does, such general topics as may form a suitable
theme for contemplation at all times and in all
circumstances.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb446</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

In our English Bible it is, "Iniquities prevail against me;" and on the margin,
"Words or matters of iniquity," etc. Calvin gives the same meaning which is
naturally suggested by our English version, although from his translating the
Hebrew text by <i>words of iniquity</i>,<i> </i>we would at first view be apt,
to suppose that he would explain them as referring to the evil reports, the
calumnies and slanders, which David's enemies propagated against him to ruin his
reputation. Dr Adam Clarke understands the words in this sense, and gives a
translation equivalent to Calvin's "Iniquitous words have prevailed against me,"
or, "The words of iniquity are strong against me." &#8212; He thinks the reading
of our English Bible "Is no just rendering of the original;" observing, that
"this verse has been abused to favor Antinomian licentiousness;" and that "the
true and correct translation of the former clause will prevent this." But we
cannot see how the verse, as it stands in our English Bible, can with justice be
viewed as tending to give encouragement to sin, it being no more than the
confession of a repentant sinner, accompanied with hope in the mercy of God,
founded on the glad tidings announced in the Gospel, that God is willing to
pardon the most guilty who believe in his Son, and repent of their sins. The old

them down. They are entirely in his hand, and absolutely beyond the. control of

his mercy, by pouring down from them upon the earth copious and refreshing
showers, to promote vegetation and produce fruitful seasons; and he can also
make them when he pleases the instruments of judgment, either by bottling them
up, or by pouring from them floods of rain, as in the deluge, and when the

chariot-wheels." God is here represented as driving round the earth, and from
the <i>clouds </i>the <i>paths </i>of his chariot everywhere scattering
blessings upon mankind. This is an instance of the bold and sublime imagery for
which the Hebrew poetry is so remarkably distinguished. God is elsewhere

Our English version renders the word in this last sense. Hammond, with Calvin,
prefers reading, "over the world." "That

says he,
"</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">a]iw&lt;n</font><font face="Palatino">,

<i>ruling the world</i>,<i> </i>or <i>over the world</i>;<i> </i>and so the

world;' and so I suppose the LXX. their
'</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">despo&gt;xouti tou~

dead, but tread promiscuously upon all that come in their way, "Thou hast
permitted us," says Dr Adam Clarke, "to fall under the dominion of our enemies,

"Per naufragium et incendium transiisse." The French version reads, "Par l'eau
et par le feu;" but it is important to retain the original more closely, as
giving what Calvin considered to be the sense of the words in the text. Fire and
water, the one of which elements consumes, while the other suffocates, is a
proverbial expression, signifying, as our author afterwards states, extreme
danger and complicated calamities. "When thou passest through the
<i>waters</i>,<i> </i>I will be with thee; when thou walkest through the
<i>fire</i>,<i> </i>thou shalt not be burnt,"

Here Calvin, as well as our English Bible, joins <i>incense </i>with
<i>rams</i>,<i> </i>appearing to mean by <i>incense</i>,<i> </i>offering by
fire, the smoke produced by the sacrifice. But the burning of incense was a
distinct offering from that of animal sacrifices; and therefore many critics
read the verse so as to make <i>incense </i>a distinct offering. Thus Horsley,
altering the punctuation, translates,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>"Offerings of
fatlings I will offer unto thee, with
incense;</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>"I will
sacrifice rams, bullocks, and full-grown goats."</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This, we think, gives an improved view of the
passage. It may be here observed, that the Hebrews were not allowed to sacrifice
other animals than these three kinds, rams, bullocks, and
goats.</font><br><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">ftb481</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
