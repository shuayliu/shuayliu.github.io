<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This and the next chapter contain, as we shall see, a
most profitable truth; and that the people might be the more attentive, God
introduced these prophecies by a preface. Jeremiah spoke many things which
afterwards, as it has elsewhere appeared, had been collected and inserted in one
volume by the priests and Levites; but God reminds us in these words, that the
prophecies which are to follow respecting the liberation of the people, were
especially to be remembered.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is, however, another circumstance<i> </i>to be
noticed. We have seen that such was the stubbornness of the people, that
Jeremiah spent his labor among them in vain, for he addressed the deaf, or
rather stocks and stones, for they were so possessed by stupor that they
understood nothing, for God had even blinded them, a judgment which they fully
deserved. Such was the condition of the people. We must further bear in mind the
comparison between the doctrine of Jeremiah and the fables of those who fed the
miserable people with flatteries, by giving them the hope of a return after two
years. God knew what would be the event; but the people ceased not to entertain
hope and to boast of a return at the end of two years. Thus they despised
God&#8217;s favor, for seventy years was a long period: &#8220;What! God indeed
promises a return, but after seventy years who of us will be alive? Hardly one
of us will be found then remaining, therefore so cold a promise is nothing to
us.&#8221; They, at the same time, as I have said, were filled with a false
confidence, as with wind, and behaved insolently towards God and his prophets,
as though they were to return sound and safe in a short time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But profane men always run to extremes; at one time
they are inflated with pride, that is, when things go on prosperously, or when a
hope of prosperity appears, and they carry themselves proudly against God, as
though nothing adverse could happen to them; then when hope and false conceit
disappoint them, they are wholly disheartened, so that they will receive no
comfort, but plunge into the abyss of despair. God saw that this would be the
case with the people, except he came to their aid. Hence he proposes here the
best and the fittest remedy &#8212; that the Prophet, as he had effected nothing
by speaking, should write and convert as it were into deeds or acts what he had
spoken,</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF1</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
so that after the lapse of two years they might gather courage, and afterwards
acknowledge that they had been deceived by unprincipled men, and thus justly
suffered for their levity, so that they might at length begin to look to God and
embrace the promised liberation, and not wholly despond. This, then, is the
reason why the Prophet was commanded to write the words which he had before
declared with his mouth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, as we understand the design of God, let us learn
that when it happens that we go astray and wander after false imaginations, we
are not on that account to cast away the hope of salvation; for we see that God
here stretches forth his hand to those who had erred, and who had even wilfully
cast themselves into ruin, for they had been more than enough admonished and
warned by true and faithful prophets; their ears they had stopped; their hearts
they had hardened; and yet when they had sought as it were designedly to ruin
themselves, we see how God still recalled them to himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that God had commanded him to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>write in a book all the words
</i></font><font face="Palatino">which he had heard; and the reason follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For, behold, come shall the days,
saith Jehovah, in which I will restore the captivity of my people Israel and
Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF2</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>There is to be understood a
contrast between the restoration mentioned here and that of which the false
prophets had prattled when they animated the people with the hope of a return in
a short time; for, as I have said, that false expectation, when the Jews sought
unseasonably to return to their own country, was a sort of mental inebriety. But
when they found that they had been deceived,<i> </i>despair only remained for
them. Hence the Prophet recalls them here to a quietness of mind, even that they
might know that God would prove faithful after they found out that they had
rashly embraced what impostors had of themselves<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>proclaimed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>We then see that there is here an implied comparison between the sure and
certain deliverance which God had promised, and the false and stolid hope with
which the people had been inebriated:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall the
days</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Now it appears that two years had
taken away every expectation; for they believed the false prophets who said that
God would restore them in two years; after the end of that time all the hope of
the people failed. Therefore the Prophet here removes that erroneous impression
which had been made on their minds, and he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the days
</i></font><font face="Palatino">would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>come
</i></font><font face="Palatino">in which God would redeem his people; and thus
he indirectly derides the folly of the people, and condemns the impiety of those
who had dared to promise so quick a return.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, see why he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>come shall the
days</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for every hope after two years
would have been extinguished, had not God interposed.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall the days in which
I wll restore the captivity of Israel and
Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The ten tribes, we know, had been
already led into exile; the tribe of Judah and the half tribe of Benjamin only
remained. Hence the ten tribes, the whole kingdom of Israel, are mentioned
first. The exile of Israel was much longer than that of Judah. It afterwards
follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Both Jews and Christians pervert this passage, for
they apply it to the time of the Messiah; and when they hardly agree as to any
other part of Scripture, they are wonderfully united here; but, as I have said,
they depart very far from the real meaning of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They all consider this as a prophecy referring to the
time of the Messiah; but were any one wisely to view the whole context, he would
readily agree with me that the Prophet includes here the sum of the doctrine
which the people had previously heard from his mouth. In the first clause he
shews that he had spoken of God&#8217;s vengeance, which rested on the people.
But it is briefly that this clause touches on that point, because the object was
chiefly to alleviate the sorrow of the afflicted people; for the reason ought
ever to be borne in mind why the Prophet had been ordered to commit to writing
the substance of what he had taught, which was, to supply with some comfort the
exiles, when they had found out by experience<i> </i>that they had been
extremely perverse, having for so long a time never changed nor turned to
repentance. The Prophet had before spoken at large of the vices of the people,
and many times condemned their obstinacy, and also pointed out the grievous and
dreadful punishment that awaited them. The Prophet then had in many a discourse
reproved the people, and had been commanded daily to repeat the same thing,
though not for his own sake, nor mainly for the sake of those of his own age, or
of the old. But after God had destroyed the Temple and the city, his object was
to sustain their distressed minds, which must have otherwise been overwhelmed
with despair. This, then, is the reason why the Prophet here touches but
slightly on the vengeance which awaited the people. There is, however, as we
shall see, great force in this brevity; but he is much fuller as to the second
part, and for this end, that the people might not succumb under their
calamities, but hope in the midst of death, and even begin to hope while
suffering the punishment which they deserved.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith Jehovah, A
cry</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, the voice of trembling, or of
fear, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>have we heard.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hdrj</font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cherede</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>is thought to mean properly that dread which makes the whole body to
tremble, and is therefore rendered trembling. God speaks, and yet in the person
of the people. Why? In order to expose their insensibility; for as they were
obstinate in their wickedness, so they were not terrified by threatenings,
however many and dreadful. God dictated words for them, for they were altogether
void of feeling. We now see why God assumed the person of those who were secure,
though Jeremiah<i> </i>daily represented to them God&#8217;s vengeance as near
at hand. The meaning is, that though the people were asleep in their sins, and
thought themselves beyond the reach of danger, even when God was displeased with
them, yet the threatenings by which God sought to lead them to repentance would
not be in vain. Hence God says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have heard the voice of
fear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, &#8220;Deride and scoff
as you please, or remain insensible in your delusions, so as to disregard as the
drunken what is said, being destitute of feeling, reason, and memory, yet God
will extort from you this confession, this voice of trembling and
fear.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and not of
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is emphatically subjoined,
that the Prophet might shake off from the people those<b> </b>foolish delusions
with which they were imbued by the false prophets. He then says, that they in
vain hoped for peace, for they could not flee from terror and fear. He enhances
this fear by saying, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Inquire and
see whether a man is in labor? </i></font><font face="Palatino">Some one renders
this absurdly, &#8220;Whether a man begets?&#8221; by which mistake he has
betrayed a defect of judgment as well as ignorance; he was indeed learned in
Hebrew, but ignorant of Latin, and also void of judgment. For the Prophet here
speaks of something monstrous; but it is natural for a man to beget. he asks
here ironically, &#8220;Can a man be in labor?&#8221; because God would put all
men in such pains and agonies, as though they were women travailing with child.
As, then, women exert every nerve and writhe in anguish when bringing forth
draws nigh, so<b> </b>also men, all the men, would have their hands laid on
their loins, on account of their terror and dread. Then he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and all faces are turned into
paleness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, God would terrify
them all.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now understand the meaning of the Prophet; for as
the Jews<i> </i>did not believe God&#8217;s judgment, it was necessary, as the
Prophet does here, to storm their hardness. If he had used a common mode of
speaking, they would not have been moved. Hence he had respect to their
perverseness; and it was on this account that he was so vehement.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Inquire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>then, he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and see
whether a man is in labor? </i></font><font face="Palatino">God would bring all
the men to a condition not manly, such as that of a woman in labor, when in her
last effort to bring forth, when her pain is the greatest and the most bitter.
Men would then be driven into a state the most unbecoming, strange, and
monstrous. It follows: &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet goes on in this verse to describe the
grievousness of that punishment for which the people felt no concern, for they
disregarded all threatenings, as I have already said, and had now for many years
hardened themselves so as to deem as nothing so many dreadful things. This,
then, was the reason why he dwelt so much on this denunciation, and exclaimed,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Alas! great is that
day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>&#8220;great&#8221;<i> </i>is to be
taken for dreadful; and he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>so that there is none like
it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It was a dreadful spectacle to see
the city destroyed, and the Temple partly pulled down and partly consumed by
fire: the king, with all the nobility, was driven into exile, his eyes were put
out, and his children were slain; and he was afterwards led away in a manner so
degraded, that to die a hundred times would have been more desirable than to
endure such indignity. Hence the Prophet does not say without reason, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that day
</i></font><font face="Palatino">would be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>great</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

torpidity of the people, for they thought that the holy city, which God had
chosen for his habitation, could not fall, nor the Temple perish, he further
says, that it would be a </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>time of
distress </i></font><font face="Palatino">to the people. But at the end of the
verse he gives them a hope of God&#8217;s mercy, even deliverance from this

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah proceeds with what he touched upon in the
last verse, even that the Lord, after having chastised his people, would at
length shew mercy to them, so as to receive them into favor. He says, in short,
that their captivity would not be perpetual. But we must remember what we have
before stated, that is, that deliverance is only promised to the faithful, who
would patiently and resignedly submit to God and not disregard his paternal
correction. If, then, we desire God to be propitious to us, we must suffer
ourselves to be paternally chastised by him; for if we resist when goaded, no
pardon can by any means be expected, for we then, as it were, wilfully provoke
God by our hardness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He therefore says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in that
day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, when the appointed time
was completed. The false prophets inflamed the people with false expectation, as
though their deliverance was to take place after two years. God bade the
faithful to wait, and not to be thus in a hurry; he had assigned a day for them,
and that was, as we have seen, the seventieth year. He then mentions the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>yoke</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that is, of the king of Babylon, and taking another view,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
chains</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The yoke was what Nebuchadnezzar
laid on the Jews; and the chains of the people were those by which
Nebuchadnezzar had bound them. At last he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And rule over them shall no more
strangers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">db[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>obed, </i>is to be taken here in a causative sense; even the form of the
sentence shews this, and they who render the words, &#8220;and<i> </i>strangers
shall not serve them,&#8221; wrest the meaning; for it could not be a promise;
and this is inconsistent with the context, and requires no confutation, as it is
evidently unsuitable. If the verb be taken in the sense of serving, then
&#8220;strangers&#8221;<i> </i>must be in the dative case. We have seen before a
similar phrase in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242514&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
25:14, where the Prophet says that neither kings nor strong nations would any
longer rule over the Jews. The same verb is used, and the same form of
expression.

the Jews to patience, and shews that though their exile would be long, yet their
deliverance was certain. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The former promise would have been defective had not
this clause been added; for it would not be enough for men to live as they
please, and to have liberty promised them, except a regular order be
established. It would, indeed, be better for us to be wild beasts, and to wander
in forests, than to live without government and laws; for we know how furious
are the passions of men. Unless, therefore, there be some restraint, the
condition of wild beasts would be better and more desirable than ours. Liberty,
then, would ever bring ruin with it, were it not bridled and connected with
regular government. I therefore said that this verse was added, that the Jews
might know that God cared for their welfare; for he promises that nothing would
be wanting to them. It is then a true and real happiness, when not only liberty
is granted to us, but also when God prescribes to us a certain rule and sets up
good order, that there may be no confusion. Hence Jeremiah, after having
promised a return to the people into their own country, and promised also that
the yoke would be shaken off from their neck, makes this addition, that having
served strangers they would be now under the government of God and of their own
king. Now this subjection is better than all the ruling powers of the world;
that is, when God is pleased to rule over us, and undertakes the care of our
safety, and performs the office of a Governor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that the design of the Prophet was to
comfort the faithful, not only with the promise of liberty, but also with this
addition, that in order that nothing might be wanting to their complete
happiness, God himself would rule over them.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Serve</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall they their
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The word <i>king </i>is added,
because God designed that his people should be governed by a king, not that the
king would sit in the place of God, but added as his minister. Now this was said
a long time after the death of David; for David was dead many years before
Jeremiah was born: nor did he live again in order that he might rule over the
people; but the name of David is to be taken here for any one that might succeed
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, as God had made a covenant with David, and
promised that there would be always one of his posterity to sit on his throne,
hence the Prophet here, in mentioning David, refers to all the kings until
Christ: and yet no one after that time succeeded him, for the kingdom was
abolished before the death of Jeremiah; and when the people returned into their
own country there was no regal power, for Zerubbabel obtained only a precarious
dignity, and by degrees that royal progeny vanished away; and though there were
seventy chosen from the seed of David, yet there was no scepter, no crown, no
throne. It is therefore necessary to apply this prophecy to Christ; for the
crown was broken and trodden under foot, as Ezekiel says, until the lawful king
came. He intimated that there was no king to be for a long time, when he
said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Cast<i> </i>down,
cast down, cast down the
crown.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;262127&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ezekiel
21:27)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He therefore commanded the name of a king to be
abolished, together with all its symbols, and that not for a short time but for
ages, even until he came<i> </i>forth who had a just right to the crown or the
royal diadem. We hence see that this passage cannot be otherwise explained than
by referring to Christ, and that he is called David, as the Jews were always
wont to call him before Christ appeared in the world; for they called the
Messiah, whom they expected, the Son of David. We now understand the meaning of
the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we may hence gather a very useful doctrine, even
this, &#8212; that nothing is better for us than to be in subjection to God; for
our liberty would become that of wild beasts were God to allow us to live
according to our own humor and inclinations. Liberty, then, will ever be
destructive to us, until God undertakes the care of us, and prepares and forms
us, that we may bear his yoke. Hence, when we obey God, we possess true and real
happiness. When, therefore, we pray, let us learn not to separate these two
things which ought necessarily to be joined together, even that God would
deliver us from the tyranny of the ungodly, and also that he would himself rule
over us. And this doctrine is suitable to our time: for if God were now only to
break down the tyranny of the Pope and deliver his own people, and suffer them
to wander here and there, so as to allow every one to follow his own will as his
law, how dreadful would be the confusion! It is better that the devil should
rule men under any sort of government, than that they should be set free without
any law, without any restraint. Our time, indeed, sufficiently proves, that
these two things have not, without reason, been joined together; that is, that
God would become the liberator of his people, so as to shake off the yoke of
miserable bondage and to break their chains, and also that he would be a king to
govern his people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we ought also carefully to notice what follows,
&#8212; that God would not otherwise govern his Church than by a king. He
designed to give an instance, or a prelude, of this very thing under the Law,
when he chose David and his posterity. But to us especially belongs this
promise; for the Jews, through their ingratitude, did not taste of the fruit of
this promise: God deprived them of this invaluable benefit, which they might
justly and with certainty have expected. As the favor which they have lost has
now been transferred to us, what Jeremiah teaches here, as I have said, properly
belongs to us; that is, that God is not our king except we obey Christ, whom he
has set over us, and by whom he would have us to be governed. Whosoever, then,
boast that they willingly bear the yoke of God, and at the same time reject the
yoke of Christ, are condemned by this very prophecy; for it is not God&#8217;s
will to rule uninterveniently, so to speak, his Church; but his will is that
Christ, called here David, should be king; unless, indeed, we accuse Jeremiah of
stating an untruth, we must apply the word David to the person of Christ. Since
it is so, God then will not otherwise rule over us than by Christ, even to the
end of the world; we must obey him and render him service.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whom I will raise
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It was also the office and work of
God to raise up Christ, according to what is said in the second
Psalm,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I have anointed my
King.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must always come to the fountain of God&#8217;s
mercy, if we would enjoy the blessings of Christ, according to what is
said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;God<i> </i>so
loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We shall, indeed, find in Christ whatever is
necessary for our salvation; but whence have we Christ, except from the infinite
goodness of God? When he pitied us, he designed to save us by his only begotten
Son. Salvation then is laid up for us in Christ, and is not to be sought
anywhere else: but we ought, ever to remember that this salvation flows from the
mercy of God, so that Christ is to be viewed as a testimony and a pledge of
God&#8217;s paternal favor towards us. This is the reason why the Prophet
expressly adds, that God would <i>raise up a </i>king to rule over his people.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet enforces his doctrine by an exhortation;
for it would not be sufficient simply to assure us of God&#8217;s paternal love
and goodwill, unless we were encouraged to hope for it, because experience
teaches us how backward and slow we are to embrace the promises of God. This,
then, is the reason why the Prophet exhorts and encourages the faithful to
entertain hope. Were there in us that promptitude and alacrity which we ought to
have, we should be content even with one word; for what can be wished for beyond
God&#8217;s testimony respecting his favor? But our listlessness renders many
goads necessary. Hence, when doctrine precedes, it is necessary to add
exhortations to stimulate us; and these confirm the doctrine, so that the grace
of God may flourish effectually in our hearts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He addresses &#8220;Jacob&#8221;<i> </i>and
&#8220;Israel;&#8221; but they mean the same, as in many other places. These
duplicates, as they are called, are common, we know, in the Hebrew language; for
the same words are repeated for the sake of emphasis. So, in this passage, there
is more force when Jeremiah mentions two names, than if he had said only,
&#8220;Fear<i> </i>not thou, Jacob, and be not afraid.&#8221; He then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fear not thou, Jacob; and Israel,
be not thou
afraid</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF5</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>And he does this, that the Jews
might remember that God had not only been once propitious to their father Jacob,
but many times; for from the womb he bore a symbol of that primogeniture which
God had destined for him; and he afterwards had, for the sake of honor, the name
of Israel given to him. As, then, God had in various ways, and in succession,
manifested his goodness to Jacob, the people might hence entertain more
hope.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls him his <i>servant; </i>not that the Jews
were worthy of so honorable a title; but God had regard to himself, and his
gratuitous adoption, rather than to their merits. He did not then call them
servants, because they were obedient, for we know how contumaciously they
rejected both God and his Prophets; but because he had adopted them. So when
David says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I am thy servant,
and the son of thine
handmaid,&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19B616&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
116:16)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">he does not boast of his obedience, nor claim to
himself any deserving virtue, but, on the contrary, declares, that before he was
created in the womb, he was God&#8217;s servant through his gratuitous adoption.
Hence, he adds, &#8220;I<i> </i>am the son of thine handmaid,&#8221; as though
he had said, &#8220;I belong to thee by an hereditary right, because I am
descended from that nation which thou hast been pleased to choose for thy
peculiar people.&#8221; We now then see that the name <i>servant, </i>ought not
to be understood as intimating the merits of the people, and that their
obedience is not here commended, as though they had truly and faithfully
responded to the call of God, but that their gratuitous adoption is alone
extolled.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I will save thee from
far</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He first declares that he would be
ready to save the people when the suitable time came; for <i>behold </i>here
intimates certainty. And he subjoins,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from
far</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>lest the people should fail in
their confidence; for they had been driven into distant exile; and distance is a
great obstacle. Were any one to promise to us an advantageous retreat, without
calling us away to some unknown country, we could more easily embrace the
promise; but were any one to say, &#8220;I promise to you the largest income in
Syria, and you shall have there whatever may be deemed necessary to make your
life happy;&#8221; would you not reply, &#8220;What! shall I pass over the sea,
that I may live there? it is better for me to live here in comparative poverty
than to be a king there.&#8221; As, then, a difficulty might have presented
itself to the Jews, when they saw that they had been driven away into very
remote countries, the Prophet adds, that this circumstance would be no obstacle
so as to prevent God to save them:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will save you
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from
far</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as though he had said, that his
hands were long enough, so that he could extend them as far as Chaldea, and draw
them from thence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and thy seed from the land of
their captivity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As the expectation of
seventy years was long, God refers what he promises to their seed. There is no
doubt but that the Prophet reminded the Jews, that the time determined by God
was to be waited for in patience, as was the case with Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob; for though they knew that they would be strangers in the land which God
had promised them, yet they did not on that account despise or disregard the
favor promised them. Abraham received in faith what he had heard from
God&#8217;s mouth,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I<i> </i>will give
thee this land;&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and yet he knew that he would be there a stranger and
a sojourner.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;011207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
12:7) His children had to exercise the same patience. Abraham had indeed been
warned of a very long delay; for God had declared that his seed would be in
bondage for four hundred years.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;011513&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
15:13) Here, then, the Prophet exhorts the people of his time to entertain hope,
according to the example of their father, and not to despise God&#8217;s favor,
because its fruit did not immediately appear; for Abraham did not enjoy the land
as long as he lived, and yet he preferred it to his own country; Isaac did the
same; and Jacob followed the example of his fathers. This, then, is the reason
why the Prophet mentions <i>seed, </i>as though he had said, &#8220;If<i>
</i>the fruit of redemption will not come to you, yet God will not disappoint
your hope, for your posterity shall find that he is true and
faithful.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If any one had then objected, and said, &#8220;What
is that to me?&#8221; the objection would have been preposterous; for why had
God promised to their posterity a return to their own country? was it not thus
to testify his love towards them? And whence came their freedom, and whence
God&#8217;s paternal love, except from the covenant? We hence see that the
salvation of the fathers was included in the benefit which their sons enjoyed.
And therefore, though the fruition of that benefit was not visibly granted to
the fathers, yet they partook in part of the fruit, for it was made certain to
them, that God would become the deliverer of his people even in death
itself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds that which is the main thing in a happy life,
that they would be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>at rest and in
a quiet state</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>so that none would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>terrify
</i></font><font face="Palatino">them;</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF6</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for a return to their own country would
not have been of any great importance, without a quiet possession of it. Hence
the Prophet, after having said that God would come to save the people, and that
distance would not prevent him to fulfill and complete what he had promised, now
adds, that this benefit would be confirmed, for God would no more allow
strangers to lead the Jews into exile, or to rule over them as they had done.
God then promises here the continuance of his favor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as this did not happen to the Jews, we must again
conclude that this prophecy cannot be otherwise interpreted than of
Christ&#8217;s kingdom. And Daniel is the best interpreter of this matter; for
he says, that the people were to be exposed to many miseries and calamities
after their return, and that they were not to hope to build the Temple and the
city except in great troubles. The Jews<i> </i>then were always terrified. We
also know, that while building the Temple, they held the trowel in one hand and
the sword in the other, for they often had to bear the assaults of their
enemies.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;160417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Nehemiah
4:17) Since, then, the Jews ever suffered inquietude until the coming of Christ,
it follows, that until his coming, this promise was never accomplished. Then the
benefit of which the Prophet speaks here is peculiar to the kingdom of Christ.
Now, since from the time Christ was manifested to the world, we see that the
world has been agitated by many storms, yea, all things have been in confusion;
it follows, that this passage cannot be explained of external rest and earthly
tranquillity. It ought, therefore, to be understood according to the character
of his kingdom. As, then, Christ&#8217;s kingdom is spiritual, it follows that a
tranquil and quiet state is promised here, not because no enemies shall disturb
us or offer us molestation, but because we shall especially enjoy peace with
God, and our life shall be safe, being protected<i> </i>by the hand and
guardianship of God. Then spiritual tranquillity is what is to be understood
here, the fruit of which the faithful experience in their own consciences,
though always assailed by the world, according to what Christ
says,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He repeats in other words what we have already
stated, but for the purpose of giving fuller support to trembling and wavering
minds. God then promises that he would be present with his people to save them.
Now as this could not easily be believed, and as the Jews looking only on their
state at that time could not but despair, the Prophet added this comparison
between them and the Gentiles. The Chaldeans and the Assyrians flourished
seventy years in every kind of wealth, in luxuries, in honor &#8212; in short,
they possessed every thing necessary for an earthly happiness. What, then, could
the Jews have thought, but that unbelievers and God&#8217;s enemies were happy,
but that they were miserable, being oppressed by hard servitude and loaded with
many reproaches, and living also in poverty, and counted as sheep destined for
the slaughter? When, therefore, all these things were plain before their eyes,
what but despair must have laid hold on their minds? Therefore God obviates this
evil;</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF7</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says that he would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>make a consummation among the

utter destruction, no hope will remain for them. But
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as to thee, I will not make a
consummation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.&#8221; </i>Thus he makes a
difference between the punishment inflicted on the reprobate and ungodly and
that by which he would chastise the sins of his people; for the punishment he
would inflict on the wicked would be fatal, while the punishment by which he
would chastise his Church would be only for a time; it would therefore be to it
for medicine and salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, perceive what the Prophet had in view:
he mitigated the bitterness of grief as to the faithful, for God would not
wholly cast them away. And he shews that their scourges ought to be patiently
borne, because they were to hope for an end of them; but that it would be
different when he visited the reprobate, because he would leave them without any
hope. In short, he says, that he would be a severe judge to the last degree as
to the unbelieving, but that he would chastise his own people as a
Father.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Other passages seem, however, to militate against
this view; for God declares that he would make a consummation as to his chosen
people, as in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;231023&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
10:23, and in other places. But the explanation is obvious; for there he refers
to the whole body of the people, which were alienated from him; but here his
word is addressed to the faithful,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;the<i> </i>remnant
of grace,&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">as Paul calls them,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:5) We ought, therefore, ever to consider who those are whom the Prophets
address; for at one time they refer to the promiscuous mass, and at another time
they address apart the faithful, and promise them salvation. Thus, then, we have
before seen that God would make a consummation as to his people, that is, the
reprobate; but the Prophet here turns his discourse to the Church and the seed
which God would preserve in safety among a people apparently cut off and lost.
Whenever, therefore, the devil would drive us to despair, whenever we are
harassed in our minds when God deals with us more severely than we expect, let
this consolation be remembered, that God will not make a consummation with us;
for what is here said of the Church may and ought to be applied to every
individual believer. God, indeed, handles them often roughly when he sees it
necessary for them, but he never wholly consumes them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will not
make</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a consummation with thee, but I
will chastise thee in judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here the
copulative ought to be taken as an adversative particle, and
&#8220;judgment&#8221;<i> </i>has the sense of moderation, as we have seen in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;241024&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
10:24,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Chastise<i>
</i>me, O Lord, but not in thy wrath;&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">he had mentioned &#8220;judgment&#8221; before. In
this sense is judgment used here, that is, for that moderation which God adopts
towards his chosen, for he is ever mindful of his mercy, and regards not what
they deserve, but what they can bear. When, therefore, God withholds his hand
and gently chastises his people, he is said to punish them in judgment, that is,
moderately. For judgment is not to be taken here for rectitude, because God
never exceeds due limits so as to be subject to the charge of cruelty; judgment
is also opposed to just rigor, and it is often opposed to injustice; but in this
place we are to understand that the contrast is between judgment and the just
rigor of God. Then judgment is nothing else but the mitigation of
wrath.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At last he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By cleansing I will not cleanse
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, &#8220;by<i> </i>cutting down
I will not cut thee down.&#8221; The verb,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hqn</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
nuke, </i>means sometimes to cleanse, or to render innocent; and it means also
intransitively to be pure and harmless; but it is to be taken here transitively.
It cannot, then, be rendered otherwise than &#8220;by<i> </i>cleansing I will
not cleanse thee,&#8221; or, &#8220;I<i> </i>will not cut thee down;&#8221; for
it has also this meaning, and either of the two senses is suitable. If we read,
&#8220;I will not cut thee down,&#8221; it is the continuation of the same
subject; &#8220;I<i> </i>will chastise thee in judgment, and I will not
therefore cut thee down,&#8221; that is, I will not make a consummation. It
would then be, as it is evident, a very suitable connection, and it would run
smoothly were we to read, &#8220;I<i> </i>will not cut thee down.&#8221; But the
other version is also appropriate, though it may admit of a twofold meaning;
some take it adversatively, &#8220;Though<i> </i>I shall not make thee
innocent;&#8221; that is, though I shall not spare thee, but chastise thee
moderately; and this intimation was very seasonable; for the flesh ever seeks
impunity. Now God sees that it is not good for us to escape unpunished when we
offend; it is then necessary to bear in mind this doctrine, that though God will
not allow us to be exempt from punishment, nor indulge us, but smite us with his
rods, he is yet moderate in his judgment towards us. But others refer to this
passage in Isaiah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I<i> </i>made thee
to pass through the furnace and refined thee, but not as silver, otherwise thou
wouldest have been
consumed.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234810&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
48:10)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God then tries his people, or cleanses them with
chastisements; but how? or, how long? &#8212; not as silver and gold, for that
would wholly consume them. For when silver is purged from its dross, and also
gold, the purer and clearer portion remains; but men, as there is nothing in
them but vanity, would be wholly consumed, were God to try them as silver and
gold. But as this interpretation is too refined, I am more disposed to adopt one
of the two first, that is, that God would not wholly cut them down, though he
would chastise them, or, that though he would not count or regard them wholly
innocent, nor so indulge them as to let them go unpunished, he would yet be
merciful and propitious to them, as he would connect judgment with his
chastisements, that they might not be
immoderate.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF8</font></sup><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The design of the Prophet is first to be noticed: he
was fighting with those impostors who gave hope of a return in a short time to
the people, while seventy years, as it has been said, were to be expected. The
Prophet then wished to shew to the people how foolishly they hoped for an end to
their evils in so short a time. And this is what ought to be carefully observed,
for it was not without reason that the Prophet dwelt much on this point; for
nothing is more difficult than to lead men to a serious acknowledgment of
God&#8217;s judgment. When any thing adverse happens, they are tender and
sensitive as to the evils they endure; but at the same time they look not to
God, and comfort themselves with vain imaginations. It was therefore necessary
for the Prophet to dwell on his doctrine at large; for he saw that the
Israelites promised to themselves a return after two years, though they had been
warned by the Prophets that they were to bear the scourge of God for seventy
years.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is the reason why the Prophet speaks here of the
grievousness of evils, not because the Israelites were insensible, but because
they had been credulous, and were still hoping for a return, so that they
deceived themselves with false comfort. He therefore says, that the

manner, &#8220;Grievousness is to thy bruising,&#8221; or breaking. He

healed; for so I understand the passage.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet speaks first without a figure, then he
illustrates the simple truth by a metaphor. He says that there was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>no one to undertake the cause
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of the people; as though he had said, that they
were destitute of every aid. This was, indeed, in a measure already evident; but
so supine was the security of the people, that they daily formed for themselves
some new hopes. Then Jeremiah declared what had already in part happened and was
still impending; and thus he proved the folly of the people, who still flattered
themselves while they were involved in evils almost without a remedy.
&#8220;Thou seest,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that there is no one to stretch forth
a hand to thee, or who is ready to help thee; and yet thou thinkest that thou
wilt soon be free: whence is this vain expectation?&#8221; He then comes to a
metaphor, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There is no one to
apply medicine for thy healing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In one
sentence he includes the whole first chapter of Isaiah, who handles the subject,
but explains more fully his meaning. There is, however, nothing obscure when the
Prophet says that there was no one to heal the evils of the
people.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF10</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must ever bear in mind his object, that is, that
the people were too easily deceived, when they hoped to return shortly to their
own country. But we may hence gather a general truth, &#8212; that men never
understand the favor of God until they are subdued by many and severe reproofs:
for they always shun God&#8217;s judgment, and then they become blind to their
own sins, and foolishly flatter themselves. And, further, when they only in
words confess that they have sinned, they think that they have done abundantly
enough. They ought therefore to be urged to the practice and duty of repentance.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet again repeats, that nothing remained for
Israel as coming from men, for no one offered to bring help.<b> </b>Some,
indeed, explain the words as though the Prophet had said, that friends, as it is
usually the case, concealed themselves through shame on seeing the condition of
the people<b> </b>hopeless: for as long as friends can relieve the sick, they
are ready at hand, and anxiously exert themselves, but when life is despaired
of, they no longer appear. But the Prophet, I have no doubt, condemns here the
Jews for the false confidence with which they had been long fascinated; for we
know, that at one time they placed hope in the Egyptians; at another in the
Assyrians; and thus it happened that they brought on themselves many calamities.
And we have seen elsewhere, in many passages, that these confederacies are
compared to impure lusts; for when the people sought at one time the friendship
of the Egyptians, at another, that of the Assyrians, it was a kind of adultery.
God had taken the Jews under his care and protection; but unbelief led them
astray, so that. they sought to strengthen themselves by the aid of others.
Hence, everywhere in the Prophets the Egyptians and the Assyrians are compared
to lovers. And this view will suit well here; for it was not enough to point out
the miseries of the people, without making known the cause of
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then the Prophet refers to those false counsels which
the Jews<i> </i>had adopted, when they thought themselves secure and safe while
the Egyptians, or the Assyrians, or the Chaldeans were favorable to them. For
this reason he says, that all
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their friends
</i></font><font face="Palatino">had<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>forgotten
</i></font><font face="Palatino">them, and also that they did not
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>inquire
</i></font><font face="Palatino">for them, that is, that they had cast off every
care for them. And he adds the reason, because God had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>smitten</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>the people </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with an hostile
wound</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here the Prophet summons them
again to God&#8217;s tribunal, that they might learn to consider that these
evils did not happen by chance,<b> </b>but that they were the testimonies of
God&#8217;s just wrath. God then comes forth here, and declares himself the
author of all those calamities; for the Prophet would have spoken to no purpose
of the miseries of the people, had not this truth been thoroughly impressed on
their minds, &#8212; that they had to do with God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, that God calls himself an <i>enemy, </i>and
compares himself to a </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cruel
enemy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>must not be so understood as that
the covenant had been abolished by which he had adopted the children of Abraham
as his own; for he, through his mercy, always reserved some remnants. Nor ought
we to understand that there was excess in God&#8217;s severity, as though he
raged cruelly against his people, when he executed his judgments: but this ought
to be understood according to the common perceptions of men. God also calls
elsewhere the Israelites his enemies, but not without
lamentation,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Alas!&#8221; he
says, &#8220;I will take vengeance on my enemies.&#8221;

<div><font face="Palatino">He assumed there the character of one grieving, as
though he had said, that he unwillingly proceeded to so much rigor, for he would
have willingly spared the people, had not necessity forced him to such severity.
But, as I have already said, when God calls himself the enemy of his people, it
ought to be understood of temporal punishment, or it ought to be explained of
the reprobate and lost, who had wholly alienated themselves from God&#8217;s
favor, and whom God had also cut off from the body of his Church as putrid
members. But as the Prophet here addresses the faithful, there is no doubt but
that God calls himself an enemy, because, according<i> </i>to the state of
things at that time, the Jews could not have otherwise thought than that God was
angry with them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cruel
one</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>we have already said, that excess
is thereby denoted, as though too much rigor or severity were ascribed to God:
but the Jews could not have been otherwise awakened<i> </i>to consider their
sins, nor be sufficiently terrified so as to be led seriously to acknowledge<i>
</i>the judgment of God. And God himself, in what follows, sufficiently proves,
that though he compares himself to a severe or cruel man, yet nothing wrong
could be found in his judgments.</font><br></div>

ascribed to him as a fault that he so severely punished the Jews, because they
deserved to be so punished. And he confirms the same thing in other words, not
that there was anything ambiguous in what he had said, but because the Prophet
saw that he had to do with perverse men. That he might then reprove their
indifference, he says, that their

difference between the promise of favors, of which Jeremiah was a witness and a
herald, and those vain boastings, by which the false prophets deceived the
people, when they encouraged them to expect<i> </i>a return in a short time, and
said that the term of deliverance was at hand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this difference ought to be noticed on this
account, because a most useful doctrine may hence be gathered: the unprincipled
men who basely pretend God&#8217;s name, have this in common with his true and
faithful servants, &#8212; that they both hold forth the favor of God: but those
who falsely use God&#8217;s name bury the doctrine of repentance; for they seek
only to soothe people with flatteries: and as they hunt for favor, they wholly
omit the doctrine that may offend, and is in no way sweet and pleasant to the
flesh. Jeremiah<i> </i>did not, indeed, deal so severely with the people, but
that he gave them some hope of pardon, and always mitigated whatever severity
there was in the doctrine of repentance:<i> </i>but at the same time he did not,
by indulgence, cherish the vices of the people, as was wont to be done by the
false prophets. But what did these do? they boasted that God was merciful, slow
to wrath, and ready to be reconciled to sinners: hence they concluded that exile
would not be long; and at the same time, as we have said, they perfidiously
flattered the people. So then, it ought to be borne in mind, that we are not fit
to receive the favor of God, nor are<b> </b>capable of it, so to speak, until
all the pride of the flesh be really subdued, and also all self-security be
corrected and<b> </b>removed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see why the Prophet subjoined the promise of
favor, after having spoken of the dreadful judgment of God. But the illative,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;kl</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>laken, </i>does not seem suitable; for how can this verse be connected<i>
</i>with the threatenings which we have noticed?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore they who devour thee
shall be devoured</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>therefore
</i></font><font face="Palatino">refers to what he had before
said.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF13</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It is not then strange, that he draws the inference, &#8212; that God having
taken vengeance on the wickedness of the people, would also execute vengeance on
their enemies. Then the illative is not unsuitable, because the time of mercy
had arrived when the Jews became<i> </i>subdued, so as to humble themselves
before God and to repent of their sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But there is here a common doctrine which we meet
with everywhere in the Prophets, even that God, after having made a beginning
with his Church, becomes then a judge of all nations; for if he by no means
spares his elect, his own family, how can he leave aliens unpunished? And it is
the perpetual consolation of the Church, that though God employs the wicked as
scourges to chastise his people, vet their condition is not better, for when
they have triumphed for a moment, God will soon bring them to judgment. There
is, therefore, no reason why the faithful should envy their enemies when they
are chastened by God&#8217;s hand, and when their enemies exult in their
pleasures; for their prosperity will soon come to an end, and with the same
measure will God mete unto them the reward of the wrong done to his
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whosoever</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>devours thee shall be
devoured, and all thine enemies, yea, all, shall go into
</i></font><font face="Palatino">captivity; and, lastly,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they who plunder
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc., which is rendered by some,
&#8220;they who tread thee shall be for treading.&#8221; But as the verb means
plundering, to avoid repetition, I prefer the former meaning:
<i>&#8220;</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who spoil thee shall become
a spoil</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they who plunder thee shall be

<div><font face="Palatino">When God promised favor to the Jews, he referred to
their enemies; for it would have been a grievous temptation, which would have
otherwise not only disturbed and depressed their minds, but also extinguished
all faith, to see their enemies enjoying all they could wish, and successful in
everything they attempted, had not this consolation been granted them, &#8212;
that their enemies would have at length to render an account for the wickedness
in which they gloried. But now the main thing is here expressed, &#8212; that
God, when reconciled to his people, would heal the wounds which he had
inflicted; for he who inflicts wounds on us, can alone heal us. He exercises
judgment in punishing, he afterwards undertakes the office of a Physician, to
deliver us from our evils. It is, therefore, the same as though the Prophet had
said, &#8220;When<i> </i>the right time shall pass away, which God has fixed as
to his people, deliverance is to be hoped for with certainty; for the Lord has
decreed to<i> </i>punish his people only for a time, and not wholly to destroy
them.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Iwill bring
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>healing, and will heal thee of
thy wounds</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And this admonition was very
necessary, for the Jews had nearly rotted in their exile when God delivered
them. They might have then been a hundred times overwhelmed with despair; but
God bids them here to raise upwards their minds, so as to expect help from
heaven, for there was none on earth. And he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because they called thee, Zion,
an outcast whom no one seeketh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is,
of whom, or of whose welfare, no one is solicitous. He confirms what I have
before said, &#8212; that the extreme evils of the people would be no hinderance
when God came to deliver them, but, on the contrary, be the future occasion of
favor and mercy. When, therefore, the people should become so sunk in misery as
to make all to think their deliverance hopeless, God promises that he would then
be their Redeemer. And this is what we ought carefully to notice: for we look
around us here and there, whenever we hope for any help; but God shews that he
will be then especially propitious to us, when we are in a hopeless state
according to the common opinion of men. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah goes on with the same subject, and dwells on
it more at large; for as it was difficult to lead the people seriously to
repent, so it was difficult to raise up desponding minds after they had been
subjected to a multitude of calamities. God then declares here again that he
would come<i> </i>to restore his people from captivity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
restore</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc., </i>as though he was already
prepared with an outstretched hand to liberate his people. Let it be noticed,
that the Prophet did not in vain represent God as present; but he, no doubt, had
regard to the want of faith in the people, and sought to remove this defect.
Since then the Jews thought themselves wholly forsaken, the Prophet testifies
that God would be present with them, and he introduces him as speaking,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I restore,
</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>etc., </i>as though he was already the
liberator of the people. He names the restoration of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tents
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>habitations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>because they had been long sojourners in Chaldea and other countries, where
they had been scattered. As then they had their own dwellings, the Prophet
reminds them that they were yet but strangers among the nations, for God would
restore them to their own country, which was their real dwelling-place. This is
the reason why he speaks of tents and habitations. He, at the same time, points
out the cause of their redemption, even mercy, so that the Jews might at length
learn to flee to this their sole asylum, and know that there was no other remedy
for their calamities than this, &#8212; that God should look on them according
to his mercy, for he might have justly destroyed them altogether. In short, the
Prophet reminds them that they must have perished for ever, had not God at
length shewed mercy to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He mentions a fuller display of his favor, &#8212;
that he would again <i>build </i>Jerusalem
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>upon its own
heap</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or hill, as some render it; for
the situation of the city was high, and towered above other parts of Judea. But
it seems to me that the Prophet means that the city would be built on its own
foundations, for he calls here the ruins heaps, or piles. For the city had been
destroyed in such a manner, that yet some ruins remained, and some vestiges of
the walls. It is then the same as though he had said, that the city, however
splendid and wealthy in former times, would yet be so restored, that its dignity
would not be less than before. But he speaks of its extent when he says, that it
would be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>built upon its
heaps</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, on its ancient
foundations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this point is confirmed by what immediately
follows, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the palace shall be set
in its own form </i></font><font face="Palatino">or station,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wfp&ccedil;m

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">fp&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>shepheth, </i>properly means judgment, but it means also form, measure,
manner, custom. Here, no doubt, the Prophet means that the king&#8217;s palace
would be equally splendid to what it had been, and in the same place. Some think
that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wmra</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>armun, </i>means the Temple; and this sense I do not reject; but as the
Hebrews for the most part understand by this term a splendid, large, or high
building, I prefer the former sense, that is, that he speaks of the royal
palace: <i>stand </i>then <i>will </i>the king&#8217;s
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>palace in its own form

fF14</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In short, he promises such a restoration
of the city and kingdom, that no less favor from God was to be expected in the
second state of the Church, than it had formerly; for God would obliterate all
memory of calamities when the Church again flourished, and the kingdom became so
eminent in wealth, honor, power, and other excellencies,<i> </i>that it would
evidently appear that God had only for a time been displeased with his
Church.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet confirms what he had said. We have stated
that the Jews, while any hope remained for them, were perverse towards God, but
that, after they were brought to extremities, they became extremely dejected;
for they lost all hope as to their state, and became so desponding that they
would receive no consolation. It was not therefore enough, slightly, or in a few
words, to promise them restoration; it was necessary that the promise should be
repeatedly confirmed. This then is now the subject of the Prophet; he promises
that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>praise and the voice of joy
</i></font><font face="Palatino">would proceed from them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We ought to notice here the contrast between
sighings, groanings, complaints, lamentations, and giving of thanks; for as long
as they were detained in exile, no praise could have been heard among them.
Sorrow is, indeed, no hinderance to prevent us to bless God in extreme misery;
but we cannot with a full mouth, so to speak, bless God, except when some cause
of joy is presented to us. Hence is that saying of James,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Is any joyful
among you? let him sing.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;590513&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">James
5:13)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As then the Prophet speaks of thanksgiving, he
intimates that God&#8217;s favor would be so great as to remove every sorrow and
sadness from the Jews. But he indirectly exhorts the faithful to celebrate
God&#8217;s kindness. Had he only said, &#8220;Go forth from them shall the
voice of joy,&#8221; it would, indeed, have been a complete sentence; but it was
also necessary to remind the faithful for what end God would deal so kindly with
his people, even that they might proclaim his goodness; for this is the design
for which we receive every good from God&#8217;s hand. Thanksgiving is then
usually connected with joy, when mention is made of the Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we have said that the faithful cannot with so
much alacrity praise God, when they are pressed down by distresses, as when God
makes their hearts to rejoice; for grief holds bound all the feelings of men;
but joy, proceeding from a perception of God&#8217;s paternal favor, dilates as
it were their souls; and hence also their tongues are set loose. For this reason
it is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;195115&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
51:15,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;O<i> </i>Lord,
open thou my lips,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and my mouth
shall shew forth thy praise.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">David there intimates that he had been for a time
silent; when God hid from him his face, he could not taste of his paternal
goodness. During that time David had his heart as it were bound and his mouth
closed; but he prays the Lord to open his mouth, that is, to grant him joy that
he might give him thanks.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive the meaning of the Prophet: he
intimates, that though the Jews would be in sorrow for a time, would groan and
mourn, yet this condition would not be perpetual; for God would at length
comfort them, so that they would not only rejoice, but also proclaim his mercy
when liberated.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will increase them, and they
shall not be lessened; I will adorn them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>etc. Some render this also, &#8220;I<i> </i>will increase them: &#8220; but
the words are different; and </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dbk

moth, </i>and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r[x</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
tsor. </i>And though the Prophet meant to repeat nearly the same thing, yet
there is no doubt but that he intended to set forth the favor of God by this
variety, as though he had said, that so remarkable would be the mercy of God,
that the Jews would acknowledge, that what had been promised to their father
Abraham had been fillfilled to them,</font><br></div>

such a thing is often of no long duration, for the form of this world passeth
away. God then promises stability and perpetuity to his Church, for he would

by no means useless; for we ought always to remember how hard were their
temptations when no token of God&#8217;s favor appeared for seventy years. It
was hence<i> </i>necessary to sustain minds overwhelmed with evils by many
supports, so that they might not wholly faint; and he adds promises to promises,
that the Jews might see as it were a spark of light from the deep abyss. And
hence, also, we may gather a useful admonition: Though the Lord may favor us
today, so that we are not exercised<i> </i>by very grievous trials, yet every
one knows by his own experience, how prone we are to despond; and then when we
once begin to faint, how difficult it is to be raised up to the confidence of
hope. Let us then learn to join promises to promises, so that if one will not

explanation, that the children of the Church would be as from the beginning,

before the Law was proclaimed: they hence think that the abrogation of the Law
is here denoted, as though he had said, that the Church would be free when
Christ came, and that the servile yoke of the Law would then be removed. But
this kind of refinement I cannot approve; for I do not think that such a notion
ever entered into the mind of the Prophet. I have then no doubt but that the
reference here is to the kingdom of David, as though the Prophet had said, that
the state of the Church would be no less prosperous and happy under Christ than
formerly under David. Were any one to object and say, that Christ&#8217;s
kingdom is much more happy than that of David: this I grant; but the prophets
ever compare the kingdom of Christ with the kingdom of David, and they were
content with this way of teaching, as it exceeded the hope of the people; for
the Jews thought it not credible that they could ever attain their ancient
renown. When, therefore, he says here, that the children of Judah would be as
<i>at the </i>beginning, there is no doubt with me but that he had a regard to
that promise, which declares that the seed of David would be for ever on his
throne, as long as the sun and moon shone in the heavens.

<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning is, that though the kingdom would through
a dreadful ruin become extinct, together with all its dignity, the Jews would
yet, through Christ, recover what they had lost through their sins, ingratitude,
and perverseness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His seed shall be established

promise concerning the perpetuity of his Church. He therefore says that the

fF16</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>by which words he bids the Jews
to look upwards, for in the world nothing was to be found but despair. God then
calls the attention of the Jews to himself, when he says that the Church would
be established before his face. And as the power of enemies was so great, that
the faithful might justly object and say, that every avenue was closed up
against God&#8217;s favor, he adds, that God on the other hand had sufficient
power to destroy and to reduce to nothing all their enemies; and he mentions
<i>all, </i>because the Chaldean monarchy was widely extended and consisted of
many nations; and there was no part of it which was not most hostile to the
Jews. As, then, the miserable exiles saw that not only the Chaldeans were
inimical to them, but also other nations, so that they were hated almost by the
whole world, God here comes to their aid, and declares that he had power enough
to destroy <i>all </i>their enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A useful doctrine may be hence deduced: The Church
was in such a manner perpetual, that its condition was yet variable; for it
often seemed good to God to break off the course of his favor before the coming
of Christ. What then happened we may accommodate to our own time. As, then, the
Prophet says here, that the children of the Church would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>be as at the
beginning</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>we need not wonder when the
Church happens at any time to be scattered, as indeed the case was under the
Papacy. For the Church was not only dead, but also buried, and was not only as a
putrid carcase, but like the dust it had wholly vanished; for what remnants
could have been found fifty years ago? We hence see that what happened under the
Law has also taken place under the kingdom of Christ; for the Church has
sometimes been overwhelmed with troubles, and has been hid without any glory or
beauty. But, in the meantime, we embrace this promise, that the children of the
godly shall be as formerly; for as the kingdom of Christ in former times
flourished, so we ought to feel assured that there is sufficient power in God to
restore to the Church its glory, so that Christ&#8217;s kingdom may again rise
up, and all God&#8217;s blessings shine forth in it. But as many enemies
surround the Church on every<i> </i>side, and the Devil ever excites everywhere
commotions and disturbances, let us know that there is another clause added,
even that God will be the defender of his people; so that how much soever the
whole world may attempt to tread under foot his favor, he will yet not suffer
them to accomplish their fury; for he has the power not only to restrain their
assaults, but also wholly to destroy them and to obliterate their memory; for
this is what is implied in the word <i>visiting. </i>It then follows

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, no doubt, explains here more at large
what he had said of the restoration of the Church; for we know that the Jews had
been so taught, that they were to place their whole confidence as to their
salvation on David, that is, on the king whom God had set over them. Then the
happiness and safety of the Church was always founded on the king; he being
taken away, it was all over with the Church, as the Anointed is said to be the
Lord, in whose spirit is our spirit. (Lamentations 4:20) Hence God has even from
the beginning directed the attention of his people to their king, that they
might depend on him, not that David was able by his own power to save the
people, but because he typically personated Christ. We have not now an earthly
king who is Christ&#8217;s image; but it is Christ alone who vivifies the
Church. But it was at that time set forth figuratively, that the king was, as it
were, the soul of the community; and we have before seen, that when the Prophet
animated the Jews with hope, he set before them David, and afterwards the Son of
David.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For the same reason, he says here,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His valiant
one</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, illustrious one,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be from
himself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For we must remember the
condition of that miserable and calamitous time when God took away every source
of joy, by depriving the people of all the dignity with which they had been
honored. It was the same then as though Jeremiah had promised the Jews a
resurrection,<i> </i>for they were in their exile as dead men, as their hope of
public safety had vanished when their king was destroyed. Here, then, he bids
them to entertain good hope, because the Lord was able to raise them from death
to life. And doubtless it was a wonderful resurrection when the Jews returned to
their own country, a way having been opened for them; for they had been<i>
</i>driven away, as it were, into another world. And who could have ever thought
that so many obstacles could have been removed, when the Chaldeans extended
their dominion even over Judea? The miserable exiles had certainly<i> </i>no
refuge. It was not then to no purpose that Jeremiah testifies here, that the
<i>strong </i>or valiant, that is, the king, would be from the people, and that
there would come forth a <i>Ruler </i>from the midst of them. To come or go
forth does not mean here to depart, as though the king would go elsewhere; but
to go forth signifies here to proceed:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go forth
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then, or proceed,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall a Ruler from the midst
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of the people: how this took place it is well
known.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But Isaiah had foretold what his successor here
confirms, saying,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Come forth shall a
shoot from the root (or stem) of Jesse, and a rod shall spring up from the root
of his tree.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;231101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
11:1)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls it there the house of Jesse, which was a
private house: he would have dignified the favor with a more glorious name, had
he mentioned David; but as there was then no kingdom, he refers to Jesse; for as
David came forth as an unknown rustic from the folds of the sheep, so also the
Lord would raise up a shoot from the stem of a tree that had been cut down. We
hence<i> </i>see in what sense Jeremiah uses the expression, &#8220;Come
forth;&#8221; for Christ rose up beyond the expectation of men, and rose up as a
shoot when a tree is cut down, that is, when there was no resemblance<i> </i>of
majesty among the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will cause him to draw near,
and he will come to me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This may be
either confined to the head or extended to the whole body; and the second idea
is what I mostly approve; for the people were a long time removed from the
presence of God, even as long as they were exiled from their country. Hence God
adds, &#8220;I<i> </i>will cause them again to draw nigh, and they shall come to
me.&#8221;<i> </i>If, however, any one prefers to explain this of the head, or
of the king himself, I offer no objection.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, we are taught from this passage, that whenever
God speaks of the restoration of the Church, he ever declares<i> </i>that he
will be entreated by us; in short, that whenever he invites us to the hope of
favor and salvation, we ought always to look to Christ; for except we direct all
our thoughts to him, all the promises will vanish away, for they cannot be valid
except through him; because in Christ only, as Paul says, they are yea and amen.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470119&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 1:19, 20) But as this truth often occurs in the Prophets, it is
enough here to touch on it by the way, as I have handled it more fully
elsewhere.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the latter part of the verse, there is some
ambiguity, &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for who is he,
this, etc</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There are two demonstrative
pronouns, </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hz
awh</font><font face="Palatino"> <i>hua, ze. </i>Afterwards comes
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">br[</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>oreb, fitting </i>his heart. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">br[</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>oreb, </i>means to be a surety, and also to fit, to adapt, to accommodate, or
to form, and sometimes to render sweet or pleasant; and on this account some
have thus translated, &#8220;Who will allure his heart?&#8221; He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he may come to me, saith
Jehovah? </i></font><font face="Palatino">I have said that this passage is
obscure, and it has hence been turned into various meanings by interpreters.
Some apply the words to Christ, that he alone has of his own accord come to the
Father. Others consider a negative to be understood, as though it was said, that
no one prepares his heart to come to God. But there are some who regard the
passage as an exhortation, &#8220;Who<i> </i>is he who will apply his heart that
he may come to me?&#8221; Now, if we read it as expressing astonishment or
wonder, it would be, in my view, its real meaning. I am not aware that any one
has mentioned this; but the Prophet, I have no doubt, intended his words to be
so understood.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He said before, &#8220;I will cause him to draw nigh;
that he may come to me.&#8221;<i> </i>I have already explained this of the
people, who had been long rejected.<i> </i>God then promises here a gathering,
as though he had said, &#8220;For a time I scattered the people here and there
like chaff; I will now gather them again together, and they shall be under my
care and protection as formerly.&#8221; Having said this, he now touches on the
ingratitude of the people by this question, &#8220;Who is there who comes to me?
who will frame his heart that he may be reconciled<i> </i>to me?&#8221; It is,
then, an expression of wonder, intended to make the Jews know that their
hardness and insensibility are condemned; for when God kindly invited them, they
rejected his favor, when he sought to embrace them, they fled far off from
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But an objection may be here made, &#8220;Why then
did God promise that he would cause the Jews to come to him?&#8221; To this I
answer, that God performs or fulfils this promise in various ways: he might have
called the Jews to himself by an outward invitation, as he did when the liberty
of returning was given them: and then, indeed, a few of the Jews accepted his
favor; but all the Israelites, already habituated to the pleasures and
enjoyments of those countries, regarded as nothing what God had promised. Thus
very few returned to their own country, and restoration was despised by them,
though they had once been very<i> </i>anxious about it. God, however, even then
made the people to draw nigh; for he stretched forth his hand as though he would
gather them and cherish them under his wings. But as the greatest part despised
his invaluable favor, God here justly complains of so great an impiety, and
exclaims as through wonder or astonishment,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is he who will form his
heart, that, he may come to me?</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Had it been simply said, &#8220;Who is he who comes
to me?&#8221; the meaning, through brevity, would have been obscure. But God
here clearly distinguishes between the two kinds of access: the first was, when
liberty was given to the people, by the decree of Cyrus, and a permission given
to build the city and the temple. God, therefore, caused them then to draw nigh
that they might come to him; this was the first access. But he now adds, that
the Jews did not form or prepare their heart. He indeed speaks of future time,
but yet he charges them with ingratitude, which afterwards was fully manifested.
Hence he says, &#8220;Who is this, that he may come to me?&#8221; that is,
&#8220;I will contrive means that they may unite again in one body, call on me
and enjoy their inheritance: this will I do that they may come to me; but many
will still live in their own dregs, and prefer Chaldea and other countries to
the temple and religion. Many, then, will be they who will not form their heart
to come to me.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now understand the meaning of the Prophet. But we
must at the same time bear in mind, that by saying above, &#8220;I will cause
him to draw near that he may come to me,&#8221;<i> </i>God does not speak of the
hidden working of his Spirit; for it is in his power, as we shall presently
remark, to draw the hearts of men to himself whenever he pleases. But when he
said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will cause him to draw
nigh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc., he spoke only of an outward
restoration; and now he adds a complaint, that the Jews would wickedly repudiate
this favor, for no one would prepare his heart. We yet see that the whole fault
is cast on the Jews, that they were to be deprived of their own country: for it
was owing to nothing on God&#8217;s part that they were not restored, but to
themselves, because they were devoted to their own pleasure, and regarded their
return and to be counted God&#8217;s people as nothing. It was therefore the
object of the Prophet to ascribe to the Jews the whole fault that God&#8217;s
favor would not come to them, or that it would not be effectual as to the
greatest part of them, even because they would not prepare or form their heart,
that they might come to God, in order that they might be partakers of that
invaluable privilege offered to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, the Papists lay hold on this passage to prove
that there is a free-will in man to come to God; but to do so is indeed very
absurd. For whenever God condemns the hardness of the people, he doubtless does
not argue the question, what power there is in men, whether they can turn to do
what is good, whether they can guide their own hearts. To hold this would be
extremely foolish. When it is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;194508&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
45:8,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;To-day, if ye will
hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as your fathers in the
wilderness,&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">shall we say that as they hardened their hearts they
were capable of turning, so that they could by the power of free-will choose
either good or evil? To say this would be puerile and extremely sottish. We
hence see that the Papists are unworthy of being reasoned with, when they seek
to prove free-will by such arguments. They would, indeed, adduce something
plausible were their exposition adopted; for they render the words thus,
&#8220;Who is this,&#8221; etc., as though God praised the promptitude of the
faithful, who willingly offer themselves and prepare their hearts. But opposed
to this view is the whole context. It hence appears that it was very far from
the Prophet&#8217;s design to represent God as commending the obedience of the
godly; but, on the contrary, he exclaims with wonder, as Isaiah does when he
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Who hath believed
our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;235301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
53:1)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He surely does not set forth the obedience of the
faithful in receiving promptly and gladly the Gospel; but, on the contrary, (as
though something monstrous terrified him) that the world would not believe the
Gospel, when yet it offered to them salvation and eternal life. So also in this
place, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is he?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">etc. For what could have been more desirable
than that God should at length, by outstretched arms, gather the Jews to
himself?&#8221;I wish you to draw nigh, ye have been for a time, as it were,
banished from me, I had driven you to distant lands; but I am now ready to
gather you.&#8221; As, then, God so sweetly and kindly allured them to himself,
it was doubtless a most abominable and monstrous ingratitude for them to reject
the offer and to turn their backs as it were on God, who so kindly invited them.
As, then, the Prophet is here only condemning such insensibility and perverse
wickedness in the Jews, there is no reason why we should be in quest of a proof
in favor of free-will.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF17</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may add, that David uses the same verb in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19B973&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
119:73, 125, when he says,</font><br></div>

turned against the Papists, who hold that it is in the power of man to form his
own heart. But David testifies that this is peculiarly the office and work of
God; for by asking this from him he doubtless confesses that it was not in his
own power. It afterwards follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">As this verse and what occurs in the first verse of
the next chapter are materially the same, they shall be both explained here. God
then says that the Jews would become a <i>people </i>to him, and that he would
become a <i>God </i>to them. This mode of speaking is what we meet with
everywhere in the Prophets; and it is very expressive, and includes the whole of
true happiness. For when have we life, except when we become the people of God?
We ought also to bear in mind that saying of the Psalmist,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">It confirms what I have just said, that a happy life
is complete in all its parts, when God promises to be a God to us and takes us
as his people. The Prophets, therefore, do not without reason so often inculcate
this truth; for though nothing else might be wanting to us that could be
expected, yet until we feel assured that God is a Father to us, and that we are
his people, whatever happiness we may have, it will only end in
misery.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet seems to speak abruptly; for nothing
could be more delightful than the promise that God gives, that he would be a
Father to the people; but he immediately adds, that there would arise an
involving
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whirlwind</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>which would abide on the head of the wicked. These things, at the first
view, seem not to harmonize. But the latter sentence may be applied to the
heathens, or to any of the enemies of the Church; for whenever God appears as
the Savior of his people, his vengeance goes forth, and is poured on the wicked.
Hence such declarations as the following often occur,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The day of my
vengeance is nigh, and the year of my visitation.&#8221;

63:4)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Isaiah joins both, the favor of God and his
vengeance: and this is often done by the other Prophets, in order that we may
see that God&#8217;s mercy cannot be clearly and distinctly perceived towards
the faithful, except when his judgment on the other hand be made conspicuous as
to the wicked. So this passage may be explained. But we may well thus connect
the words of the Prophet, &#8212; that he kindly endeavored to allure the people
by offering them God&#8217;s favor; but that having seen that it would be
despised, as we stated yesterday, by the greater part of them, he now seasonably
threatens them, that if they refused the favor offered them, such ingratitude
could not be borne by God. And this is a mode of teaching common in Scripture.
For God on his part thus manifests his kindness so as to stimulate men; but as
he sees them not only slothful and tardy, but also wicked and ungrateful, he
declares that they shall not be unpunished if they despise his favor. The former
truth then well agrees with what the Prophet now says, &#8212; that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wrath of
</i></font><font face="Palatino">God would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>arise

wicked. But the former sense has been more generally taken, and I am disposed to
embrace it; for it tends to shake men with terror, when the storm is said to be
like a whirlwind, for it turns and twists around, so that it cannot be avoided.

wicked. But we may take the wicked,

fled to the mercy of God. It afterwards follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms the last sentence, and compares the wrath
or the vengeance of God to a messenger or a minister, who is sent to carry a
message, or to perform what has been commanded him. Of God&#8217;s word, that
is, of his threatenings as well as of his promises, Isaiah speaks
thus,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;My word shall not

<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning is, that whatever God promises or
threatens, is never without its effect. But they wrongly understand the passage
who say that the word of God returns not void, because it brings forth fruit;
for he speaks of the effect of the word, whether for salvation or for perdition.
So now also God declares that his vengeance, when gone forth, shall not return
until it fulfils what has been commanded.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the thoughts of his
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The thoughts of his heart he
calls the decrees<i> </i>or purposes of God; but it is a mode of speaking taken
from men, and therefore metaphorical; for it is not consistent with what God is,
either to think or to deliberate. But, as to the subject itself, there is
nothing ambiguous; for the Prophet means, that when God sends forth his
vengeance, all the wicked<i> </i>must perish, for so has God decreed,<i> </i>and
his purposes can never be frustrated. Then he shews that God&#8217;s vengeance
will be accomplished, because God has so determined. For God does not dissemble
when he promises salvation to men, or denounces on them the punishment which
they have deserved; but he executes the decrees<i> </i>or purposes of his
heart.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF20</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then the Prophet here condemns the stupidity of all
those who thought that they could escape, though they had often heard that their
guilt was so great that they must at last be visited with judgment. Though they
had often heard this, yet they were deaf to all warnings; and it was for this
reason that the Prophet spoke of the thoughts of God&#8217;s
heart.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At last he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>At the extremity of days ye shall
understand this</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This may be applied to
the faithful no less than to the wicked. For though the faithful embraced
God&#8217;s promises, and relied on them, yet, as they had to contend constantly
with the heaviest trials, it was necessary to stimulate and animate them to
patience. It might then be suitably said to them, &#8220;Ye shall understand
this in the last days;&#8221; it being a kind of exhortation, as though he had
said, &#8220;Ye indeed think the wicked happy, because God does not immediately
punish them, because his vengeance does not instantly break forth in thunders
against them; but patiently bear your miseries, and ye shall at length find that
their destruction has not been in vain predicted; and ye shall also receive a
reward for your faith and patience, if ye continue resigned to the last.&#8221;
But the sentence may also be suitably applied to the wicked, because they were
wont to form their judgment according to the present aspect of things. Hence the
Prophet exposes the false opinion by which they deceived themselves, and says,
that too late they would understand what they were then unwilling to
perceive.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If then we explain this sentence of the children of
God, it is an exhortation to bear patiently their evils until God appeared as
their defender: but if we apply it to the unbelieving, it is a derision of their
insensibility, because they regarded as fables all threatenings; but the Prophet
exclaims, &#8220;Ye shall at last become wise, but it will be too
late.&#8221;<i> </i>Even experience becomes a teacher when there is no more
opportunity to repent.</font><br></div>

fF21</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now come to the truth which the Prophet
handles: he reminds the people, no doubt, of the ancient benefits of God, in
order that the miserable exiles might entertain hope, and not doubt but that God
would be their deliverer, though they were drowned, as it were, in Chaldea, and
overwhelmed with a deluge of evils. This is the reason why he mentions the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>desert</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and why Jeremiah also adds, that they who were then preserved
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had escaped from the
sword</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For the people, though they dwelt
in a pleasant and fertile country, were in a manner in a desert, when compared
with their own country. As then the Israelites had been driven far away into
foreign lands, all the regions where they then inhabited are compared to a
desert. A similar mode of speaking is adopted by Isaiah when he
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;A voice crying in
the desert, Prepare ye the way of Jehovah, make straight paths in the
wilderness.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234003&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
40:3)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What did he understand then by desert? even the most
fertile regions, Chaldea, Assyria, and other neighboring countries. But with
regard to the people,<i> </i>he thus calls these countries, because their exile
was always sorrowful and miserable. So then in this place the Prophet, in order
to animate the exiles with hope, says, that though they had been sent away to
unknown regions, yet distance, or anything else which might seem opposed to
their liberation, could not prevent God to restore them; for he formerly
liberated their fathers when they were in Egypt.; Now as the Jews<i> </i>might
again object and say, that they were few in number, and also that they were ever
exposed to the sword, as they dwelt among conquerors the most cruel, he says,
that their fathers were not preserved otherwise than by a miracle; they had been
snatched, as it were, from the midst of death.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive<i> </i>the design of the Prophet; and
we may include in a few words the substance of what he says, &#8212; That there
was no reason to fear, that God would not, in due time, deliver his people; for
it was well known, that when he became formerly the liberator of his people, his
power was rendered illustrious in various ways, nay, that it was inconceivably
great, since for forty years he nourished his people in the desert, and also
that their coming out was as though the dead arose from their graves, for the
Egyptians might have easily killed the whole people; so that they were taken as
it were from death, when they were led into the land which had been promised to
Abraham. There was therefore no doubt but that God would again, in a wonderful
way, deliver them, and manifest the same power in liberating them as was
formerly exhibited towards their fathers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A profitable doctrine may hence be gathered: Whenever
despair presents itself to our eyes, or whenever our miseries tempt us to
despair, let the benefits of God come<i> </i>to our minds, not only those which
we ourselves have experienced, but also those which he has in all ages conferred
on his Church, according to what David also says, who had this one consolation
in his grief, when pressed down with extreme evils and almost overwhelmed with
despair,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I<i> </i>remember

(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19E305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
143:5)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So that he not only called to mind the benefits of
God which he himself had experienced, but also what he had heard of from his
fathers, and what he had read of in the books of Moses. In the same manner the
Prophet here reminds us of God&#8217;s benefits, when we seem to be forsaken by
him; for this one thought is capable of alleviating and comforting us. This is
the import of the whole. It now follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The last part is commonly rendered, &#8220;I have
therefore drawn thee in mercy;&#8221; but the sense is frigid and unsuitable. I
therefore doubt not but that he, on the contrary, means, that the mercy of God
would not be evanescent, but would follow the people from year to year in all
ages. At the beginning of the verse the Prophet introduces the Jews as making a
clamor, as the unbelieving are wont to do, who, while they reject the favor of
God, yet wish to appear to do so with some reason. Then, in the first place, is
narrated the blasphemy of the people. These impious and diabolical words were no
doubt everywhere heard at that time, &#8220;He! God has appeared to us, but it
was a long while ago:&#8221; as profane men say at this day, when we bring
forward examples of God&#8217;s favor from the Law or from the Prophets, or from
the Gospel, <i>He!</i> <i>c&#8217;est du temps jadis. </i>Thus, they facetiously
deride whatever God has at any time testified in his word, as though it were
obsolete, because it is ancient. It is the same when we announce any terrors
according to ancient examples, &#8220;He! it happened formerly, but a long time
ago.&#8221; They then always return to that impious common saying, <i>Le temps
jadis. </i>And the same thing Jeremiah meant to express here,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>At a remote time Jehovah appeared
to us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, &#8220;Thou indeed
speakest in high terms of the redemption by which the fathers were liberated,
but what is that to us? why dost not thou rather shew us plainly what God
intends to do? and why dost thou not bring forward some ground for present joy?
why dost thou not really prove that God is propitious to us? but thou speakest
of the ancient deliverance, while that narrative is now as it were
obsolete.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see, that men have been always from the
beginning ungrateful to God; for as far as they could, they buried the kind acts
of God; nor by this only was their impiety discovered, but because they treated
with scorn all ancient histories, which have yet been preserved for us, in order
that our salvation might be promoted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Whatsoever is
written,&#8221;</font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>says
Paul</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">, &#8220;has been written for our
instruction, that through the patience and the consolation of the Scripture we
might have hope.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451504&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
15:4)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He there shews that we are to learn patience from the
examples contained in the Scripture, and that we have there a ground for strong
consolation, so that we may cherish hope until God delivers us from all
miseries. But what say the profane?&#8221; He, thou tellest us what has been
written, but this is remote from us, and through length of time has vanished
away: what is antiquity to us?&#8221; But though the Jews used this sacrilegious
language, let us yet learn to embrace whatever is set before us in Scripture,
while God invites us to hope for mercy, and at the same time exhorts us to
patience; nor let this blasphemy ever fall from our mouths; nay, let not this
thought ever creep into our hearts, &#8220;God<i> </i>appeared a long while
ago.&#8221; Let us then abominate the ingratitude of those who would have God to
be always present, and yet pay no regard to his ancient
benefits.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence the Prophet answers, <i>But, </i>etc.: the
copulative
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino"> is
here an adversative, as though he had said, Nay, or Yea, for it may also be
taken for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;g</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gam, </i>&#8220;Yea, I have loved thee with perpetual love.&#8221; Then God
answers the ungodly, and shews, that he having become once the liberator of his
people, did not undertake this office through a momentary impulse, but because
he had so promised to Abraham, and had adopted the people. Since then
God&#8217;s covenant was perpetual, he thus refutes here the impious calumny,
that God acted bountifully only for a moment towards his people, and had regard
only once for their miseries, so as to help them.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yea</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have loved thee
with perpetual love</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>God then here
shews, that the redemption, by which he had exhibited a remarkable proof of his
mercy, was founded on the gratuitous adoption which was not for one year, but
perpetual in its duration. We thus see that he reproves the detestable blasphemy
of the people, and intimates that adoption was the cause of their
redemption.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this passage ought to be carefully noticed: for
these false imaginations come<i> </i>immediately to our minds, when we read or
hear how God had in various ways and degrees been merciful towards his people,
&#8220;He! that happened formerly, but we know not whether God&#8217;s purpose
remains the same; he, indeed, conferred this favor on his ancient people, but we
know not whether the same can or will be extended to us.&#8221; Thus the devil,
by his craft, suggests to us these false imaginations, which impede the flow of
God&#8217;s favor, that it may not come to us. So the grace of God is stopped in
its course, when we thus separate ourselves from the fathers, and from all his
servants towards whom he has been so merciful. It is, therefore, a doctrine
especially useful, when the Prophet shews, that whatever blessings God has at
any time conferred on his ancient people, they ought to be ascribed to his
gratuitous covenant, and that that covenant is eternal: and hence there is no
doubt but that God is at this day prepared to secure the salvation of all the
godly; for he remains ever the same, and never changes; and he would also have
his fidelity and constancy to shine forth in the covenant which he has made with
his Church. Since, then, the covenant of God is inviolable and cannot fail, even
were heaven and earth brought into confusion, we ought to feel assured that God
will ever be a deliverer to us: how so? because his covenant remains the same;
and, therefore, his power to deliver us will remain the same. This is the use we
ought to make of this clause.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A confirmation afterwards follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore have I prolonged
towards thee my mercy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I have already
said, that this clause is otherwise rendered and explained. But nothing can be
more diluted when we read thus, &#8220;I have drawn thee in mercy.&#8221; What
has this to do with the perpetuity or the continued course and progress of love?
But the other meaning is very suitable, that God would prolong his mercy to
Israel. There is understood only one letter, but this does not interfere with
the sense; and such forms of speech are elsewhere often found, he then says,
that as he had embraced Israel with perpetual love, he had, therefore, drawn out
or extended his mercy; for from the time he delivered his people from the
tyranny of Pharaoh, and fed them forty years in the desert, he had bestowed on
them many benefits. For with what victories favored he them? and then how often
had he pitied them? God then ceased not from continuing his mercy to them from
the time he had stretched forth his hand to them. And according to this view it
is very appropriately said, that he had prolonged his mercy; for not only for
one day or one year did he shew himself propitious to the Israelites, but he had
exhibited himself the same for four hundred, five hundred, six hundred years.
And thus also is best confuted that impiety and blasphemy of the people, that
God had formerly appeared to them; &#8220;Nay,&#8221;<i> </i>he says,
&#8220;except thou suppressest most wickedly my benefits, thou must perceive
that the benefits I conferred on thy fathers have been long extended to thee,
and have been perpetual and manifold.&#8221;</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF22</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive the real meaning of the Prophet. Were
any to prefer turning the preterite to the future, I would not object,
&#8220;Therefore will I prolong (or extend) towards thee my mercy.&#8221; This
sense would be suitable. But when the words are taken as they are, we see why
the Prophet adds, that God&#8217;s mercy had been prolonged, that is, that he
might condemn the ingratitude of the Jews, because they did not rightly consider
the benefits which had been bestowed on them for so many ages. It follows

subject, &#8212; that though there would be the long time of seventy years, yet
God would become the liberator of his Church. Length of time might have
extinguished the faith of the people, as it is too commonly the case: for when
nothing appears to us but the naked word, and when God repeats the same promises
from day to day, we think it of no moment; and then when some evil has been
prevailing, we think that all ways have been already closed up, so that God
cannot bring a remedy; we thus measure his power by our own standard: and as he
comes late to help us, because he suffers men to be long afflicted with disease
or other evils, so we imagine that God will never come, when he suspends and
delays his favor longer than we wish.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence the Prophet says here,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will yet build thee, and built
shalt thou be, virgin of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and
then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou shalt yet be adorned
with thy tabrets</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Joy is here set in
opposition to the grief with which the people were to be oppressed in exile, and
in part had been already oppressed, for many had been driven into exile. But
Jeremiah expresses their joy and gladness by a figurative mode of speaking, by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tabrets
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dances of those who
play</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For when the Prophets announce the
vengeance of God, they are wont to say, &#8220;cease<i> </i>shall all joy among
you; ye shall not play any more with the harp or with musical
instruments.&#8221; So also in this place Jeremiah says, that they would return
to the tabrets and dances, when God restored them to their own country. We ought
not at the same time to turn this testimony of the Prophet to excuse profane
lasciviousness, by which profane men pervert the benefits of God, for they
preserve no moderation in their joy, but abandon themselves, and thus become
wanton against God. And it is the tendency of all dances and sounds of tabrets,
to besot profane men. The Prophet then did not intend to allow this sort of
licentiousness to the people: for we must ever bear in mind what he said
yesterday, that the voice of praise would go forth with joy. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tabrets
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dances,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">he then means holy joy, connected<i> </i>with
praises to God, and with the sacrifice of
thanksgiving.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino">The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">llj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chelal, </i>means to profane, but it means also to apply to common use. The
expression is taken from the Law; for it was not lawful to eat of the fruit of
the vine until after the fourth year; for its uncircumcision as it were remained
in the vine, so that its fruit was unclean. Then its first-fruits were offered
to God; afterwards every one enjoyed his vintage. <i>(</i>Leviticus<i>
</i>19:23-25) But at the same time Jeremiah had respect to<i> </i>the curses
which we read of elsewhere,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Thou shalt plant a
vineyard, and others shall eat its fruit.&#8221;

<div><font face="Palatino">What did he then mean by these words? even that the
country would, for a time, be so deserted, that there would be no vines on the
richest and the most fertile mountains. The mountains of Samaria were rich in
vines; and when vines on these were cut down, there was a dreadful desolation.
When, therefore, the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall yet plant a
vineyard</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he intimates that the land
would be desolate for a time; so also when he says, I
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will yet build
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he reminds the Jews, that they
were to bear with resignation the judgment of God, while they could see nothing
but desolation through the whole land.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This, then, is what the word <i>yet </i>intimates:
but when he promised that there would be vines again on the mountains of
Samaria, he adds, that they who planted them would enjoy the fruit. Here, then,
is an additional blessing: it would have availed them nothing to plant or set
vines, except this blessing of God was added; for it is a very grievous thing to
be deprived of a possession which we have cultivated, and on which we have spent
much labor. He then who has diligently planted vines, and he who has cultivated
his land, if driven into exile, feels deeply wounded in his mind, when he sees
that his vines and his land are in the possession of strangers. Hence the
Prophet here intimates that God&#8217;s favor would be certain, because he would
not only give leisure to the Jews, when they returned, to plant vines, but would
also cause them to enjoy the fruit in peace and quietness. They shall then
<i>profane,</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here amplifies the kindness of God,
because he would not only restore the tribe of Judah, but also the ten tribes,
who had previously been led into exile. He then promises here a full and
complete restoration of the Church. The Prophets do not always speak in the same
manner of the liberation of the people; sometimes they confine what they say to
the tribe of Judah, as though the rest were in a hopeless state, but often they
extend their prophecies to<i> </i>the whole body of the people. So in this place
Jeremiah includes, together with the tribe of Judah, the ten tribes, and the
half tribe of Benjamin, for some of the tribe of Benjamin had remained and had
never revolted from the family of David. But they usually call the kingdom of
Israel the ten tribes, and denote the kingdom of Judah by the name of that one
tribe: thus the tribe of Benjamin, divided into two parts, is not
mentioned.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning, then, of the Prophet is, that when God
redeemed his people, not only Judah would return, but also the Israelites, of
whom there was hardly a hope, because they had been in exile for a long time;
and as they had rejected the pure and legitimate worship of God, they might have
been thought to have been excluded from the Church, for by their own perfidy
they had shut out themselves, so that they were unworthy of so honorable a
distinction. So the Prophet here declares that God&#8217;s favor would surpass
the wickedness and perverseness of the people of Israel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the day
</i></font><font face="Palatino">would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>come
</i></font><font face="Palatino">in which
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>watch-men
</i></font><font face="Palatino">would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cry on the mountain of
Ephraim</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. By Ephraim, as it is well
known, are often to be understood the ten tribes, and that on account of
Jeroboam, who first reigned over them. But we ought ever to remember, that under
one tribe, in this case, are included all the ten tribes. When, therefore, the
Prophet speaks of watchmen on Mount Ephraim, he means all the watchmen, placed
on their watchtowers, through the whole kingdom of Israel. But the contrast
ought to be noticed, for Jeroboam had closed up every passage by which the
Israelites might ascend to Jerusalem; for he feared lest they should there hear
of God&#8217;s covenant which he had made with David and his posterity. He was
in at ease with himself, because he had obtained the kingdom by sinister means.
God had, indeed, by his Prophet commanded him to be anointed a king; but it does
not hence follow, that as to himself he had obtained the kingdom justly. It is
true that God intended to punish Rehoboam and also the people; but he who had
been the author of the revolt was perfidious in seeking to establish a kingdom
for his posterity; he forbade any one to ascend to Jerusalem, and therefore he
built altars in Dan and Bethel.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;111229&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 12:29-31) On this account the Prophet Hosea complains that they besieged
the ways like thieves, and that many who ascended to Jerusalem to offer
sacrifices to God were slain; and some were plundered and sent home. (Hosea:6:9)
The contrast then is worthy of being noticed, when the Prophet
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Yet<i> </i>cry
shall watchmen on Mount Ephraim, Arise, let us ascend to Zion to our
God.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For though in appearance they forsook only the
posterity of David, they yet at the same time renounced the true and pure
worship of God; and the religion which they followed under Jeroboam was
spurious; for they ought to have offered sacrifices to God only in one place,
for it is often found in the Law,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Thou<i> </i>shalt
come to the place which the Lord thy God shall choose.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;051226&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
12:26)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But they having despised the place which God had
appointed for himself, built altars elsewhere. Then their worship was nothing
but superstition; and though they multiplied sacrifices, they did nothing but
provoke God&#8217;s wrath; for it is not lawful for us to devise anything beyond
what is prescribed in the Law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet therefore says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cry shall watchmen, Arise, let us
ascend into Zion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, there will
not be such a division among the people as there was formerly. For a few only
worshipped God in the Temple which had beell built by his command, and the rest
gave themselves up to numberless superstitions; but now they shall again unite
in one body. In short, Jeremiah here teaches us, that all the children of
Abraham would return to a fraternal agreement, and that there would be a bond
between them, a unity of faith, for they would together unite in offering
sacrifices, and no one would invent a god for
himself.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF25</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this passage is especially useful; for we may
hence learn what is the right state of the Church; it is when all agree in one
faith. But we must, at the same time, see what is the foundation of this faith.
The Papists indeed boast of this union, but yet they pass by what ought to hold
the first place, that is, that all must have regard to the only true God,
according to what they are taught by his word. Hence the Prophet here mentions
Mount Sion, which had been chosen by God, that he might shew that no unity
pleases God, unless men obey his word from the least to the greatest, and not
follow their own imaginations, but embrace what he teaches and prescribes in his
Law. This is the import of this passage. The Israelites shall then call him
<i>their God, </i>from whom they had before wickedly departed. It follows

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet confirms the contents of the verse we
have explained; and it was necessary to make this addition, because what he had
said was almost incredible. He therefore enlarged upon it.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>this preface he made, as I have
often reminded you, that his doctrine might have more weight. Jeremiah, indeed,
adduced nothing but what he had learnt from God, and by the revelation of his
Spirit; but it was needful sometimes expressly to testify this on account of his
hearers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now bids them to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>exult with joy, and to shout for
joy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It must be observed that this
prophecy<i> </i>was announced, when the utter destruction of the people, of the
city, and temple, was not far distant; but it was the Prophet&#8217;s object to
comfort, so to speak, the dead in their graves, so that they might patiently
wait for their promised deliverance, and that they might feel assured that it
was not more difficult for God to raise the dead than to heal the sick.
Therefore the prophecy had its use when the Jews were driven into exile and
miserably scattered, so as to have no hope of deliverance. But that his doctrine
might more effectually enter into their hearts, he exhorts them to rejoice, to
shout for joy, and to sing; and not only them, but also strangers. For though it
will presently appear that their joy was not in common with the unbelieving,<i>
</i>the Prophet yet seems to address his words on purpose to aliens, that the
Jews themselves might become ashamed for not embracing the promise offered to
them. For what doth the Prophet say? &#8220;Ye alien nations, shout for joy, for
Jacob.&#8221;<i> </i>What should Jacob himself do in the meantime? We now then
see the design of the Prophet&#8217;s vehemence<i> </i>in bidding all to rejoice
for the redemption of the people, even that this prophecy might not only bring
some comfort to the miserable exiles, but that they might also know, that whilst
in the midst of death, they would live before God, provided they did not
despair.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short, he not only intended to mitigate their
sorrow, but also to fill them with spiritual joy, that they might not cease<i>
</i>to entertain hope and to take courage, and not only patiently, but
cheerfully<i> </i>to bear their calamities, because<i> </i>God promised to be
propitious to them. This is the reason why he bids them to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>exult with joy, and to shout for
joy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>among the chief of the
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This may be understood as
though the Prophet had said, that the nations would be so contemptible, that the
children of God would not be disposed to insult them; but I understand the words
in a simpler way, &#8212; that the Prophet bids them to exult
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>at the head of
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as though he had said,
&#8220;openly,<i> </i>so that your joy may be observed by all.&#8221; For though
the Jews entertained the hope of a return, yet they hardly dared to give any
sign of their confidence, because they might have thus exasperated the minds of
their enemies. They were, therefore, under the necessity of being wholly silent,
and, as it were, without life. Now the Prophet sets this manifest joy in
opposition to that fear which constrained the Jews to be almost wholly mute, so
that they dared not by gesture nor by words, to make known what they had learned
from the holy servants of God. In short, the Prophet intimates that the
liberation of the Jews would be so glorious, that they would dread no danger in
proclaiming openly the kindness of God. This seems to be denoted by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the head of the
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Proclaim ye, praise and say,
Save</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. This refers properly to the
faithful; for we know that God is not really invoked by the unbelieving. Faith
alone opens a door of access to us, and there cannot be any right praying except
what proceeds from faith. The Prophet then addresses here the children of God,
when he says, &#8220;Proclaim<i> </i>ye, praise and say,&#8221; etc. And though
all the ungodly were by evident experience convinced of the wonderful power of
God, yet there was not among them any herald of God&#8217;s grace. It is then
enjoined on the faithful, as their own proper office, to celebrate the favor of
God. And to this is added thanksgiving, as though the Prophet had said that
God&#8217;s grace cannot be rightly proclaimed unless his goodness be
acknowledged, and the sacrifice of praise be offered to him. We hence learn that
we are to be so animated by his promises to trust in God as not to grow torpid.
For many cheer themselves up when they hear some joyful news, but this joy
produces in them security. Thus it comes that faith is choked, and does not
produce its proper fruits; for the chief work of faith is prayer to God. Now,
they who are secure because they think of no danger, do not flee to God, and
thus omit that work of religion in which they ought mainly to exercise
themselves. Hence the Prophet reminds the faithful here that they are so to
praise God as not to neglect prayer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning is, that when God promises that he will
be propitious to us, he gives us a sufficient reason for joy. We ought then to
be satisfied with the naked word of God, when he declares that he will be a
Father to us, and when he promises that our salvation will be the object of his
care. But yet, as I have already said, joy ought not to render us secure, so as
to make faith idle, but it ought rather to stimulate us to prayer. True and
spiritual joy we then have, derived from God&#8217;s word, when we are diligent
in prayer; and coldness and security are no tokens of faith, but of
insensibility; and the promises of God produce no real effects in us, as it must
needs be, unless our minds are kindled into a desire for prayer, yea, into a
fervor in prayer. This then is the reason why the Prophet, after having bidden
the faithful to praise and exalt the favor of God, adds this prayer &#8212;
&#8220;Say ye, Save thou, Jehovah, thy people.&#8221; It then behoved them so to
rejoice as to feel solicitous for the restoration of the Church. And it behoves
us, also, at this time, whenever God shines on us with the testimony of his
favor, so to rejoice as not to omit that primary exercise of faith, even
prayer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He further adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the remnant of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because it was necessary that
what Isaiah had predicted should be fulfilled,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Though thy people
were as sand of the sea, a remnant only shall be delivered.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;231022&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
10:22)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though, then, the Prophet has been speaking generally
of all the posterity of Abraham, and included the ten tribes, yet here he
qualifies that statement by mentioning
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the remnant
</i></font><font face="Palatino">or residue
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and this in order that the
faithful might not despond on seeing hardly one in ten or in fifty returning
from exile; for we know that in comparison of their great number, a few only
returned from exile. He has then mentioned here &#8220;the remnant of
Israel,&#8221; that the faithful at a future time might not be shaken in their
hope, though God did not immediately restore the whole Church; and it was also
necessary to deprive the hypocrites of that vain confidence with which they were
filled; for they were wont to seize on everything which God promised by his
servants. Hence Jeremiah excluded them, that they might know that this promise
did not belong to them, according to what Paul, while handling this subject,
shews to us at large.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450927&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:27;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:5,7) And he is a correct interpreter of this passage and of similar ones,
when he says that God was never so bound to the people of Israel, but that he
could freely do what he pleased, so that a remnant only should he saved. And he
calls them the &#8220;remnant of grace,&#8221; because they are in no other way
saved than through the free and gratuitous goodness of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this doctrine may also be justly applied to our
time. For we are by no means to expect that God will so restore his Church in
the world, that all shall be renewed by his Spirit, and unite in true religion;
but he gathers his Church on all sides, and yet in such a way, that his
gratuitous mercy ever appears, because there shall be remnants only. It follows,

</i>from God, but that the address might be more forcible, he introduces God
himself as the speaker, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold me
restoring them from, the land of the north</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>for Babylon, as it is well known, was northward from Judea. And whenever the
Prophets speak of the deliverance of the people, they ever name the north; as,
also, when they threaten the people, they say that an army or a calamity was to
come from the north. They had before been delivered from the south, for such was
the situation of Egypt. The Prophet now intimates that God was furnished with
power to liberate them again from the land of the north.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and I will collect them from the
sides of the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sides</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he means the extremities or the corners, so to speak, of the earth; as
though he had said, that their dispersion would not prevent God from collecting
his people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nearly the same promise was announced by Moses,
though in other words, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Though thou wert
dispersed through the four quarters of the world, I will yet from thence collect
thee.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(Deuteronomy
30:4)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God there means that distance of places would be no
obstacle to him, but that as soon as the fit time arrived, he would again
collect his Church from its dispersion. We hence see what the Prophet
understands by the <i>sides </i>of the earth. And he intended to obviate a doubt
which might have depressed the minds of the people on seeing the body torn and
deformed: &#8220;Eh!<i> </i>how can it be, that we can again come
together?&#8221;<i> </i>In order then to remove this doubt, the Prophet says
that God would come to collect his people again, not only from one corner, but
also from the extreme regions of the earth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adopts another mode of speaking, in order to
shew that no impediment would be so strong as to exceed God&#8217;s power, when
his purpose was to deliver his people:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
blind</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and the lame, the pregnant, and
the one in travail, shall come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The
blind cannot move a step without stumbling or falling; then the blind are by no
means fit to undertake a journey, for there is no way which they can see as open
for them; and the lame, when there is a way for them, cannot make any progress.
But God promises that such would be their deliverance, that both the lame and
the blind would participate of it. He then mentions the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pregnant and women in
childbed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The pregnant, owing to the
burden she carries, cannot undertake a long journey, and she that is recently<i>
</i>confined, can hardly dare to leave her bed, being so debilitated by
parturition; but God promises that the pregnant and the lately confined shall
return with the rest; as though he had said, that there was no fear but that God
would restore his Church, because his power was superior to all the impediments
of the world, so that he could confirm the feeble, guide the blind, sustain the
lame, and strengthen the pregnant and those lying in childbed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, though the Prophet addressed this discourse to
the ancient people, it yet contains a doctrine perpetually useful. We hence
gather, that they act preposterously who estimate God&#8217;s favor according to
present appearances. But this is a mistake almost inbred in us by nature, and
engrosses all our thoughts and feelings. Hence arises want of confidence in God,
and hence it also happens, that all God&#8217;s promises become frigid to us, or
at least lose their just value. For when God promises anything, we look around
us and inquire how it can be fulfilled; and if our minds cannot comprehend the
way and manner, we reject what has proceeded from the mouth of God. Let us then
attend to this prophetic doctrine; and when God seems to promise what surpasses
our faith, nay, what appears to us by no means possible, let this doctrine come
to our minds, and let it serve as a corrective to check our false thoughts, lest
we, having our minds preoccupied by a false and preposterous opinion, should do
wrong to the power of God. If, then, the deliverance which God promises seems
incredible, as to our perceptions, let us remember that it is in his power to
make the blind to see, the lame to walk, the pregnant and those lying in
childbed, to undertake a journey; for he can by his power surmount all
obstacles, so that we shall find our faith victorious, provided we learn to rely
on God&#8217;s promises, and firmly rest on them. We now understand what use we
ought to make of this prophecy. It follows afterwards &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet still pursues the same subject; but he
adds, that though they went with weeping into exile, yet that would be no
impediment, that God should not restore them again to their own country: for I
take the beginning of this verse,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in weeping shall they
come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>in an adversative sense. Some
explain weeping as the effect of joy; for joy as well as grief sometimes brings
tears. Some then think the meaning of the Prophet to be, that so great would be
the joy on their return, that tears would flow from their eyes. But I, on the
contrary, think, that the Prophet means what was afterwards repeated in one of
the Psalms,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Going forth they
went forth and wept; but coming they shall come with exultation, carrying their
sheaves.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19C606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
126:6)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For the Prophet compares the exile of the people to
sowing; for except the seed cast on the earth dies, it remains dry and barren,
and does not germinate: the death then of the seed is the cause of production.
So also it was necessary for the people to be by exile thus cast on the ground,
that their calamity might be a kind of death to them. But he says that the Jews
when cast forth as a seed, that is, when driven into exile to be put to death by
the chastening rod of God, &#8220;had come with weeping;&#8221; but that
afterwards they returned with joy as in harvest, that is, when liberty to return
was granted them. So also the Prophet here speaks, as I think, in an adversative
sense, of the Jews; the particle <i>though </i>is to be
understood.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It afterwards follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With
prayers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or mercies,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will I lead
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ynwnjt</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
techenunim, </i>which is found mostly in the plural number, means prayers; and I
know not whether this sense is suitable here. In Zechariah, the word being
connected with grace, it cannot be otherwise explained than of mercy,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;380709&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
7:9) and I am inclined to adopt this meaning here, even that the weeping of the
people would be no hinderance, that God should not at last shew mercy to them,
and turn their weeping and tears into laughter and joy. But if any one prefers
to render the word, prayers, the sense would not be improper; that is, that when
they began suppliantly to confess<i> </i>their sins, and to flee to God&#8217;s
mercy, there would then come the time of joy. But weeping then must be applied
to blind grief, for the Jews were not as yet subdued so as to submit to God, to
be humbled and to repent. Hence weeping is to be taken in a bad sense, even for
grief, mixed with perverseness, when they murmured against God; and the Prophet
must have taken prayers as tokens of repentance, that is, when the Jews,<i>
</i>having been truly convinced of their sins by many and continual evils, would
begin to flee to God&#8217;s mercy. But he seems rather to set God&#8217;s
mercies in opposition to the sorrow in which the Jews were involved when God hid
his favor from them.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF26</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will lead them to fountains of
waters</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>according to what is said in the
book of Psalms, that they would find fountains and wells on their journey.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;198406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
84:6) For the Jews had to travel through deserts and sterile sands; so they
thought that they lived in another world while they were in Chaldea: they
remembered how vast was the solitude through which they had passed. Hence then
was their despair, so that they refused every<i> </i>comfort when the Prophets
exhorted them to entertain good hope. God therefore promises to be their leader
on their journey, so that they should not want water in the lonely and barren
desert. And we see that the Prophet, by the various figures he uses, means one
and the same thing, even that whatever obstacles may meet us, to prevent us from
tasting of God&#8217;s goodness, and to embrace the promises of salvation, they
will all vanish away, if we bear in mind the infinite power of God.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lead them by fountains of

valley be raised and mountain be made low, so that rough places may become
plain, and the crooked (or tortuous) become straight
ways.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We thus see how these prophecies harmonize, and ought
to be regarded as teaching the same thing, &#8212; that God surmounts all
obstacles when it is his purpose to save his Church; for how much soever all the
elements may unite against the salvation of the godly, God can by one breath
dissipate them all, and cast down the loftiest mountains that may be in his way,
and give rivers in deserts and dry lands; and thus he can constrain to obey him
whatever may seem opposed to the salvation of his Church.</font><br></div>

<i>eua, </i>as it is well known, is taken in the place of a verb. Here Jeremiah
points out the cause, and as it were the fountain of the deliverance of which he
has been hitherto speaking, even because God would become reconciled to his
people. He intimates also the cause of the exile and of all the evils that had
been and would be, because they had provoked God by their sins. God had indeed
adopted them as his people in the person of Abraham; but the Prophet intimates
an interruption when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
will be</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>though the covenant of God had
never been annulled. He was then ever the Father of the Church, but the benefit
of adoption did not appear; as to outward appearance<i> </i>the people seemed as
rejected, as it has been said in other places: and on this subject Hosea also
speaks in these words,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I will say to her

expelled from their inheritance, but that they were wholly alienated from God.
He was therefore no Father to them at that time, that is, he did not appear to
be so, although he did prove himself to be a Father really and effectually. He
then began to be a Father when the people returned into their own country,
because God&#8217;s favor then shone forth, which for a time had been as it were

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND NINETEENTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We explained yesterday how God began to be a Father
to Israel when he restored him from exile. Adoption, with regard to God,
remained indeed the same, as it has been stated; but as to the judgment of men,
it was abolished. He then began anew so to collect his people,<i> </i>that they
might really know him as their Father.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ephraim would be his
first-born</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Ephraim is no doubt taken
here for the whole people; nor does the Prophet here make any distinction
between the two kingdoms, but includes even the tribe of Judah in the name
Ephraim, as it is done in many other places. But yet it is proper to observe,
that Ephraim is sometimes taken for all the posterity of Abraham, sometimes for
the kingdom of Israel, and sometimes for that tribe itself. When the kingdom of
Judah is distinguished from the kingdom of Israel, then Ephraim includes only
the ten tribes; but in this place the Prophet did not intend to mark the
difference between the tribe of Judah and the ten tribes, because it would have
in this case been very strange to call Ephraim the first-born; for we know that
Ephraim had been rejected from a regard to David, as it is said in the
Psalms,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;And God refused
the tribe of Joseph, and rejected the tabernacles of Ephraim; he chose the tribe
of Judah whom he
loved.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;197867&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
78:67, 68)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There a comparison is made between the kingdom of
Judah which God had erected, having added a promise, and the kingdom of
Jeroboam, which was, as it were, spurious; for the revolt from the family of
David had torn the body of the Church, so that it became as it were mutilated.
For this reason it is said that Ephraim was rejected, that is, because God
regarded David alone and his posterity with paternal favor; and of his whole
family it was said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;He shall call me,
&#8216;My Father;&#8217; and I will say to
him</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;Thou art my
Son.&#8217;&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;198926&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
89:26)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In this place then, the Prophet speaks generally of
the people, as though he had said that it was only a temporary division when the
ten tribes had formed for themselves a kingdom of their own, but that they would
become one people, so that Ephraim would differ in nothing any more from Judah.
To the same purpose is what is said by Hosea,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;When Israel was a
child I loved him,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and from Egypt
have I called my Son.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;281101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Hosea
11:1)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There the Prophet calls the people Israel; he does
not, however, denote the ten tribes only, but he placed in the first rank David
and his posterity. Indeed, the Prophets, when prophesying of the restoration of
the Church, direct their eyes to the first unity which God had fixed among the
people, for it was then only the true state of things, when the twelve tribes
preserved a fraternal union. We now then perceive why the Prophet says that
Ephraim was God&#8217;s <i>first-born.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be asked here, &#8220;With respect to whom
is he thus called? for it follows that there were other sons of God, if Ephraim
was the first-born among them.&#8221; But this conclusion is not well-founded;
for Mary is said to have brought forth her first-born son, who was yet her only
son,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400125&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
1:25) and Christ is called elsewhere the first-begotten with: reference to<i>
</i>all the faithful,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;that he might be
the first-born among many brethren.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450829&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
8:29)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But Mary had brought forth her only son. Hence the
word, &#8220;first-born,&#8221; does not prove that others follow, the second
and the third in their order; but we may say that Ephraim was called the
first-born of God with reference<i> </i>to the Gentiles, who at length became
partakers of free adoption: for we also are the children of Abraham, because<i>
</i>we have been planted by faith among the elect people; yet this solution
seems to me more refined than solid. I then give this simple interpretation,
that Ephraim was called the first-born because he was preferred to all the
Gentiles; God was pleased to choose them as his people. This then was the
peculiar privilege of the seed of Abraham; for though the human race was one and
the same, yet it pleased God to choose and adopt Abraham and his posterity. It

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet dwells at large on the redemption which
was in the opinion of all incredible, especially as so many years had already
elapsed; for it was the full extent of human life when the people had been
buried, as it were, in their graves for seventy years. Then the length of time
alone was sufficient to cut off every hope. No wonder then that our Prophet sets
forth in a lofty strain the return of the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence he exclaims,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear, ye nations, the word of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And then, as by God&#8217;s
command, he sends forth heralds here and there to proclaim the favor granted:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go
ye</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and announce it in remote
islands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Now, by these words he
intimates that the liberation of the people would be a remarkable demonstration
of God&#8217;s power, which was to be made known through all nations. Had not
this been said, the hope of the people must have failed through its own
weakness, and been reduced, as it were, to nothing. But when they heard.
Jeremiah&#8217;s prophecy respecting this extraordinary favor of God, it was no
common consolation to them; that is, that God would become such a deliverer to
them that he would exercise his power in such a way as to become evident even to
remote nations, yea, the report of which would penetrate into the farthest
regions. By <i>islands </i>the Prophets mean countries beyond the sea; thus by
the Jews, Italy, Spain, Greece, France, were called Islands. Then the Prophet
here by remote islands, means all the regions of the world distant from Judea,
and especially those beyond the sea.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he who has dispersed Israel will
gather him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This sentence<i>
</i>confirms the hope of liberation; for God could easily redeem his people,
since their exile was a punishment inflicted by his own hand. Had the Chaldeans
obtained the victory over them by their own prowess, they might have cast away
all hope as to their deliverance. God then exhorts the people here to entertain
hope, because he could heal those wounds which he himself had inflicted; as
though he had said, &#8220;I am he who drove you into exile, am I not able to
bring you back? Had you been led away by the power of your enemies, you might be
now without any hope of deliverance; but as nothing happened but through my
righteous judgment, mercy can bring a remedy for all your evils.&#8221; Then God
shews that their liberation could be easily effected, since the Chaldeans gained
nothing by their own power, but as far as he permitted them when chastising his
people. He then reasons from contraries, that since<i> </i>he had dispersed, he
could also gather them. For had the Israelites been dispersed at the will and
pleasure of men, their deliverance might have seemed to be beyond the power of
God; but as he had chastised them, he could, as I have just said, heal the
wounds inflicted by his own hand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A useful doctrine may be hence deduced: the Prophet
invites the people to repentance by reminding them that God had dispersed them;
for had not the miserable people known this and been fully persuaded of it, they
would not have fled to God&#8217;s mercy, nor have regarded him, nor entertained
hope of deliverance. It was, therefore, necessary that repentance should in due
order precede, that the people might embrace the deliverance offered to them.
This is the reason why the Prophet says, that it was God who had <i>dispersed
</i>Israel. He indeed reasons, as I have said, from contraries; but the
sentence, no doubt, contains the exhortation which I have now stated, that the
people might know that they suffered a just punishment; for it was not by
chance, nor by the will of men, but by God&#8217;s righteous judgment, that they
had been driven into exile.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and he will guard them as a
shepherd his flock</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Prophet here
shews that God&#8217;s favor would not be momentary, but that their liberation
would be the beginning of a deliverance continued to the end; and to know this
is most necessary; for what would it avail us to be once delivered by God? Were
it so, our salvation would soon fail. But when we hear that we are delivered by
God from the tyranny of our enemies for this end, that he may continue towards
us his favor, that he may become our perpetual guardian and shepherd, this is a
solid ground of confidence. This then is the reason why the Prophet, after
having spoken of the deliverance of his people, at the same time adds, that God
would be their <i>shepherd, </i>that he would perpetually guard and preserve his
people. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He goes on with the same subject. He had said before
that it would not be a difficult or an arduous work for God to deliver his
people; he now says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah will
redeem his people, and will redeem them from the hand of one more powerful than
themselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Jeremiah again obviates the
doubt which might have dejected the minds of the godly; for this thought ever
recurred to them, &#8220;How can God redeem us? he might indeed have cheeked the
Chaldeans, but now they rule over the whole East; this monarchy is like<i> </i>a
gulf in which the whole world is swallowed up: since then God has thus exalted
the Chaldean power, we are wholly without hope.&#8221; They might then have
despaired when they compared this evil with all the remedies that might occur to
them. But the Prophet here confirms what he had just stated, that God would be
more powerful than the Chaldeans and all other enemies; as though he had
said,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;Though your enemies are strong, and ye are
like sheep in the jaws of wolves, yet nothing can hinder God from redeeming
you.&#8221;</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF28</font></sup><br></div>

contract, but I sold you on account of your sins; as to them, they have given me
no price: let nothing, therefore, terrify you as though they could oppose your
deliverance against my will.&#8221; How so? &#8220;Because<i> </i>they have no
right to detain you; therefore, if ye only accept my favor, the strength of your
enemies, which appears so formidable, shall not hinder your redemption.&#8221;
This is the reason why he says that the Chaldeans were stronger or more powerful
than the Israelites.</font><br></div>

day; for when we consider how great is the strength of our enemies, despair must

the restoration of the Temple, for otherwise the return of the Jews to their own
country would have been of no great importance; nay, it would have been better
for them to have remained in Chaldea, if they only regarded quietness, wealth,
and pleasures; for we know how great was the fertility and pleasantness of
Chaldea. Then as to the benefits of an earthly and fading life, dwelling there
would have been more advantageous to the Jews; but their return to their own
country was to be looked for chiefly that they might be separated from heathens,
and might rightly worship God, and so dwell in the promised inheritance, as to
be strangers in the world, having respect to their celestial
rest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What then has been hitherto said of the
people&#8217;s return would have been unimportant, had not this promise been
added respecting the restoration of God&#8217;s worship. At the same time he
exhorts the Israelites to gratitude by shewing to them the end for which they
were to be made free, even that they might sing praises on the height of Zion.
We, indeed, know that the Temple was built on the top of that hill. But the
Prophet mentions the height or high place, because<i> </i>gratitude was freely
expressed when the Jews<i> </i>returned to their own country; for while they
lived in exile they were like persons mute. It is hence said in the
Psalms,</font><br></div>

fF29</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This mode of speaking, common
among the Prophets, ought to be specially noticed. They describe the kingdom of
Christ in a way suitable to the comprehension of a rude people, and hence they
set before them external images; for when Christ&#8217;s kingdom is the subject,
mention is made of gold, of silver, of every kind of wealth, and also of great
splendor and of great power, for we know that what is beyond and above the world
cannot be immediately comprehended by the human mind. We are here inclosed, as
it were, in prisons &#8212; I speak not of our bodies; but while we sojourn on
earth, we cannot raise our minds upwards so as to penetrate as far as the
celestial glory of God. As, then, the kingdom of Christ is spiritual and
celestial, it cannot be comprehended by buman minds, except he raises up our
thoughts, as he does, by degrees. This, then, is the reason why the Prophets
have set forth the kingdom of Christ by comparing it to earthly kingdoms. We
also know that there was a peculiarity in the Old Testament, when God covered
with shadows what was afterwards clearly revealed in the Gospel; in Christ the
heavens are opened to us. Hence this form of stating the truth would now be not
only superfluous to us, but even injurious, as it would draw us back from the
enjoyment of heavenly things. For we ought to distinguish between our state and
that of the ancient people. Paul reminds us that they were children under a
schoolmaster, being under the Law; but that we are grown up, and that,
therefore, the bondage under which the Fathers lived, has come to an end through
the coming of Christ.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480323&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:23-25)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though David was endued with a singular gift of the
Spirit, yet he confined himself within his own limits; for he knew that God
intended so to rule at that time his Church, as that the manner of teaching
should be suitable to children. But now, after we have grown up in Christ, the
figures and external images have ceased; for though godliness has promises
respecting the present as well as the future life, as Paul testifies,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540408&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 4:8) we ought yet to rise above that doctrine which is elementary. Hence
when the Prophets promise wine, and oil, and wheat to the faithful, their object
is to raise up their minds by degrees and gradually to higher things, according
to the condition and comprehension of childhood.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this ought to be carefully noticed; for many
profane men, when they read such sentences, think that the people were addicted
only to present gratifications, and that all the Jews were slaves to their
appetites, and were fed by God like swine or oxen. But such an opinion is to be
altogether abhorred; for they who entertain it not only wrong the Fathers most
grievously, whose hope was the same as ours, as thy ever looked forward to an
eternal inheritance, being strangers, as the Apostle tells us, in this world,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;581113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:13) but they also disunite the body of the Church, and extinguish the grace
of God, which was granted formerly through many ages, though it was only at the
coming of Christ that God commenced to proclaim to men his eternal salvation.
But we must bear in mind that the holy Fathers were not so brutish in their
minds, that they confined their thoughts to this world; for they knew that they
had been adopted by God, that they might at last enjoy a celestial life; and
hence they called themselves sojourners. Jacob, who had long dwelt in the land
of Canaan, says that his whole life had been a continual pilgrimage.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;014709&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
47:9) And the Apostle wisely notices this, when he says that they were
acknowledged by God as his children, because they were strangers in this world.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;581113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:13) Then the holy fathers had the same hope as we now receive from the
Gospel, as they had also the same Christ. But the difference is, that God then
set forth his grace under visible figures, and it was, therefore, more obscure,
but that now, figures and types had ceased, and Christ has come forth and
appeared to us more clearly. I have therefore said, that this doctrine ought to
be wisely applied to our use, lest we seek to be fed and crammed when God
invites us to the participation of his grace. But we ought to know, that of all
men, we are the most miserable, if our hope is confined to this world; and yet,
at that time this way of teaching was very necessary, for the return of the
people, as it has been stated, required it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, then, let us know that by saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall flow together to the
goodness of Jehovah, to wine, oil, and wheat,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">something better and more excellent than food
and sufficiency is promised, and that what is spiritual is conveyed under these
figures, that the people might, by degrees, ascend to the spiritual kingdom of
Christ, which was as yet involved in shadows and obscurity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their soul shall be as a watered
garden</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He intimates that their
abundance would be perpetual. When a fruitful year happens, fruits then, indeed,
abound, and the quantity of wine and wheat is more than the demand; but after a
fertile year sterility follows, which absorbs the previous abundance; and so it
often happens, because men through their ingratitude, as it were, drive away
God&#8217;s blessing, so that it does not flow to them in a continuous course;
but God promises here that the souls of the people would be as watered gardens,
because they were not to be satisfied only for a short time, but were at no time
to be exposed to want, or famine, or to any deficiency.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says further,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall again mourn no
more</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He confirms the same thing by
using various forms of expression; but what he substantially means is, that when
God&#8217;s people were made free, God&#8217;s blessing would be continued to
them, so that the faithful would not be subject to the common miseries of
men.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF30</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For we know what our condition is in this world, for every<i> </i>hour, nay,
almost every moment, our joy is turned into sorrow, and our laughter into tears.
But God promises here that he would be so propitious to his Church, that it
would have a perpetual cause for rejoicing. Now, how this comes to pass we do
not easily comprehend; for though God in Christ has plainly unfolded to us the
treasures of celestial life, yet we always creep on the earth. Hence it comes
that we do not attain what is contained in these sentences which speak of the
true and real happiness of the godly. However, we ought, in the main, to regard
our joy as perpetual; for whatever evils may happen to us, yet God shines on us
by his grace, and thus all things turn out for our good, and are aids to our
salvation, as Paul tells us in Romans:8:28. And thus we cease not to glory in
distresses and afflictions, as he also teaches us in the fifth chapter; and we
dare to triumph over cold and heat, over nakedness and all other evils, and even
over death itself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must bear in mind that Christ&#8217;s kingdom
only begins in us here, and in the rest of the world; it is, then, no wonder
that we taste so little of the benefits which the Prophets extol in such high
terms. When, therefore, a temptation of this kind creeps in, when God treats us
more sharply then we desire, &#8220;What does this mean? Wert thou one of
God&#8217;s children, would he not deal with thee indulgently as he has
promised? Where is that abundance of wheat, wine, and oil, for thou art often in
want? Thou always livest in penury, nor does there appear to be anything better
for thee to-morrow, as thou art now robbed and art come to a barren
country,&#8221; &#8212; now<i> </i>when such a temptation as this creeps<i>
</i>in, such as may draw thee to despair, let this doctrine come to thy mind,
&#8220;Is the kingdom of God made perfect in thee?&#8221; Now if not one of us
has hardly entered into God&#8217;s kingdom, there is no wonder that we are not
partakers of all the good things which God has promised to his people; for if
Christ&#8217;s kingdom is weak and feeble in us, it is nothing but right that we
should live, as it were, in that penury which tempts us to distrust God; the
same is the way with the whole world. There is, then, no reason to wonder that
God does not fulfill what he has promised under Christ&#8217;s kingdom, when men
are not capable of receiving so great a kindness; for it is
written,</font><br></div>

says that joy would be in common to young women and young men, and also to the

elsewhere, &#8212; that wantonness in which the world indulges in its hilarity,
was not permitted; as to profane men, there is no moderation in their joy. The
Prophets followed the common mode of speaking; and, indeed, the Israelites had
their dances while celebrating the praises of God; but it was a chaste and
modest joy, yea, and a sacred joy, for it was a mode of worshipping God. Yet the
Prophet speaks according to the common practices<i> </i>of the people, as in

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This verse is connected with the former; for what the
Prophet had said generally of the whole people, he now distinctly declares
respecting the priests, for they were, as it were, the heart of the people; and
by this order God gave a lively representation of his favor. This is the reason
why the Scripture, in setting forth God&#8217;s blessing to his chosen people,
speaks especially of the priests, as it appears from many places. Then the
Prophet intimates that God would be bountiful indiscriminately to all the
Israelites, but that his peculiar favor would be conspicuous towards the
priests, for the condition of the people would not be complete without the
priesthood, for the priesthood was, as it were, the soul. They would have lived
like the heathens, had not God prescribed how he was to be called upon and
worshipped. And having mentioned the priests, he does not confine himself to
them, but the favor of God is extended to the whole people. It is not then only
of the priests that the Prophet speaks, but he declares that the people would be
made blessed through God&#8217;s bounty, and yet that his peculiar kindness
would be manifested towards the Levitical priests, according to what we read in
the Psalms: a special blessing is promised to the priests, accompanied with
felicity to the godly; and David, when felicitating himself on having so many of
God&#8217;s blessings, by which he was distinguished, does indeed mention the
provisions of his table and abundance of all other things, yet he immediately
adds,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I will dwell in
the house of the Lord.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;192306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
23:6, 7)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By this conclusion, he intimates, that he esteemed as
nothing what profane men desire, except he enjoyed as the first thing the
worship of God; for this is the main part of our happiness. For wherefore do we
live, except we learn, while we partake of blessings from God&#8217;s hand, that
he is our Father, and that we are stimulated by his bounty to worship him, and
except we surrender ourselves wholly to his word?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, perceive<i> </i>the Prophet&#8217;s
object in saying, that the priests would be satiated
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with
fatness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;&ccedil;d</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>deshin, </i>fatness, denotes abundance of all things; so <i>satiate
</i>intimates the great extent of God&#8217;s bounty. Some render it
&#8220;inebriate,&#8221; but improperly; and it would be inappropriate to say,
&#8220;I will inebriate with fatness.&#8221; But
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hwr</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
rue, </i>means to irrigate and also to satiate: hence<i> </i>the Prophet said,

rue. </i>So also now God means, that he would be so bountiful towards his
people, that nothing would be wanting to the full affluence of all good things.
And he again says the same thing with regard to the whole people,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My people shall be satisfied with
my goodness, saith Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We hence see
that nothing is promised to the priests, except in connection with the whole

<div><font face="Palatino">Here, in the first place, the Prophet describes the
desolation of the land, when deprived of all its inhabitants; and, in the second
place, he adds a comfort, &#8212; that God would restore the captives from
exile, that the land might again be inhabited. But there is here what they call
a personification, that is, an imaginary person introduced: for the Prophet
raises up Rachel from the grave, and represents her as lamenting. She had been
long dead, and her body had been reduced to ashes; but the discourse has more
force when lamentation is ascribed to a dead woman than if the Prophet had said,
that the land would present a sad and a mournful appearance,<i> </i>because it
would be waste and desolate; for rhetoricians mention personification among the
highest excellencies,<i> </i>and Cicero, when treating of the highest ornament
of an oration, says, that nothing touches an audience so much as when the dead
are raised up from below. The Prophet, then, though not taught in the school of
rhetoricians, thus adorned his discourse through the impulse ot God&#8217;s
Spirit, that he might more effectually<i> </i>penetrate into the hearts of the
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this personification introduces a scene, for it
brings before us the Jews and the other Israelites; nor does it only represent
to them the calamity that was at hand, and what had already in part happened,
but it also sets before their eyes the vengeance of God which had taken place in
the destruction of the kingdom of Israel, when first four tribes were driven
into exile, and afterwards the whole kingdom was destroyed, and it also sets
forth what the Jews<i> </i>little thought of and did not fear, even the extreme
calamity and ruin of the kingdom of Judah, and of the holy
city.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith Jehovah, A voice on
the height is heard, even lamentation, the weeping of
bitterness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he introduces God as the
speaker; for the Jews, though they had seen the dreadful scattering of their
brethren, were yet remaining secure; and hence another Prophet complains, that
no one laid to heart the calamity of Joseph.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;300606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Amos
6:6) They saw that the whole land was almost consumed by God&#8217;s vengeance,
as though a fire had raged everywhere; and yet they followed their own
gratifications, as Isaiah also accuses them. (Isaiah 22) This is the reason why
God is made to speak here: he had to do with men altogether torpid and heedless.
That the Prophet then might awaken them from their torpor, he introduces God as
making the announcement, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A voice
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is
heard</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, &#8212; </i>whose<i> </i>voice? of
<i>Rachel.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Interpreters think that Rachel is mentioned, because
she was buried in Bethlehem: but as to Joseph, that is, his posterity, this
region had come by lot, it seems to me probable that the Prophet here refers not
to the grave of Rachel, but to her offspring; for that part which they who
descended from her son Benjamin had obtained, was laid waste; hence he
introduces Rachel as the mother of that part of the country; and it is well
known that under the tribe of Ephraim is included the other ten tribes: but the
reference to her burial is without meaning.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rachel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>weeping for her
children, refused consolation, because they were
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF32</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, she could not receive
consolation, for a reason was wanting, as her posterity were destroyed, and were
become extinct in the land.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage is quoted by Matthew,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
2:18) where he gives an account of the infants under two years old, who had been
slain by the command of Herod: then he says, that this prophecy was fulfilled,
even that Rachel again wept for her children. But the explanation of this is
attended with no difficulty; for Matthew meant no other thing than that the same
thing happened at the coming of Christ as had taken place before, when the whole
country was reduced to desolation; for it was the Evangelist&#8217;s object to
remove an offense arising from novelty, as we know that men&#8217;s minds feel a
dread when anything new, unexpected, and never heard of before happens.
Hence,<i> </i>the Evangelists often direct their attention to this point, so
that what happened in the time of Christ might not terrify or disturb the minds
of men as a thing new and unexpected, inasmuch as the fathers formerly had
experienced<i> </i>the same. To no purpose then do interpreters torture
themselves by explaining this passage allegorically; for Matthew did not intend
to lessen the authority of ancient history, for he knew in what sense this had
been formerly said; but his only object was to remind the Jews<i> </i>that there
was no cause for them to be greatly astonished at that slaughter, for that
region had formerly been laid waste and bereaved of all its inhabitants, as
though a mother, having had a large family, were to lose all her
children.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF33</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see how Matthew accommodated to his own
purpose this passage. He retains the proper name, &#8220;Ramah,&#8221; and there
was a place so called; but the appellative is preferable here, &#8220;A voice is
heard on the height,&#8221; as we had yesterday, &#8220;on the height of
Zion.&#8221; Then a high place is what Jeremiah has mentioned here, because
lamentation was to be heard through all parts of the country, for a voice sent
forth from a high place sounds afar off.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF34</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Now, also, we perceive the meaning of
this sentence, &#8212; that the country possessed by the sons of Benjamin had
been reduced to desolation, so that the mother, as one bereaved of her children,
pined away in her lamentation, as nothing could afford her comfort, because<i>
</i>her whole offspring had been cut off.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now follows a promise which moderates the
grievousness of the calamity. And the two verses ought to be read as opposite
the one to the other, &#8220;Though Rachel, weeping for her children, has no
ground for consolation for a time, yet God will console her.&#8221;<i> </i>And
thus the Prophet, in the former verse, exhorts the Jews<i> </i>to repentance,
but in the latter to hope: for it was necessary that the Jews should be
forewarned of their dreadful calamity, that they might acknowledge God&#8217;s
judgment; and it was also necessary for them to have their minds inspired with
hope. Now, then, the Prophet bids them to be comforted; for Rachel, having long
bewailed her children without any consolation, would at length obtain
God&#8217;s mercy. God then would console Rachel after her long
lamentation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Refrain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thy voice from
weeping</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The word is
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hkb</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
beke: </i>as he had mentioned this word before in the second place,
&#8220;lamentation, the weeping of bitterness,&#8221; so he now repeats the same
here, &#8220;Refrain thy voice from weeping,&#8221; that is, cease to complain
and to bewail the death of thy children,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and thine eyes from
tears</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The meaning is, that the
lamentation of Rachel would not be perpetual. We<i> </i>have said that a dead
woman is introduced, but that this is done for the sake of solemnity and effect,
so that the Jews, having the matter set as it were before their eyes, might be
more touched and moved. But if we wish to understand the meaning of the Prophet
without a figure it is this, &#8212; that the lamentation would not be
perpetual, because the exiles would return, and that the land that had fallen to
the lot of the children of Benjamin and of Joseph would again be
inhabited.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for reward shall be to thy
work</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He means that the sorrow of Rachel
would at length happily come to an end, so as to produce some benefit. While the
faithful, according to Isaiah, were complaining that they were oppressed with
grief without hope, they said, &#8220;We<i> </i>have been in travail, and
brought forth wind:&#8221;<i> </i>by these words they meant that they had
experienced the heaviest troubles; and then they added, &#8220;without
fruit,&#8221; as though a woman were in travail and suffered the greatest pain
and anguish, and brought forth no living, but a dead child, which is sometimes
the case. Now a woman who gives birth to a living child rejoices, as Christ
says, because a man is born,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431621&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
16:21) but when a woman after long pains brings forth a dead lump or something
monstrous, it is an increase of sorrow. So the Prophet says, that the labor of
Rachel, that is, of her country, would not be without fruit:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there shall
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>be a reward to thy
work</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Scripture uses the same way of
speaking in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;141507&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 15:7, where the Prophet Azariah speaks to the King
Asa,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Act manfully, and
let not your hands be weakened, for there shall be a reward to your
work.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then by work is to be understood trouble or sorrow,
and by reward a joyful and prosperous issue. The meaning is, that though the
whole country mourned miserably for a time, being deserted and bereaved of its
inhabitants, yet the issue would be joyful, for the Lord would restore the
exiles, so that the land would be like a mother having a numerous family, and
delighting in her children, or in her offspring.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, were any one to apply this to satisfactions, he
would be doing what is very absurd, as the Papists do, who say that by the
punishment which we suffer we are redeemed from eternal death, and that then the
vengeance<i> </i>of God is pacified, and satisfaction is made to his justice.
But when the Prophet declares that there would be reward to the work, he does
not commend the fruits of the punishment by which God chastised his people, as
though they were, as they say, satisfactions; but he simply reminds them that
their troubles and sorrows would not be useless, for a happier issue than the
Jews<i> </i>hoped for would take place. But it is God&#8217;s gratuitous gift
that there is a reward to our work, that is, when the miseries and calamities
which he inflicts on us are made aids to our salvation. For doubtless whatever
evils we suffer, they are tokens of God&#8217;s wrath; poverty, cold, famine,
sterility, disease, and all other evils, are so many curses inflicted by God.
When, therefore, there is a reward to our troubles and sorrows, that is, when
they produce some benefit or fruit, it is as though God turned darkness into
light; for naturally, as I have said, all these punishments are curses. But God
promises that he will bless us, so that all these punishments shall turn out for
our good and salvation, as Paul tells us in Romans 8:28.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall return from the land
of the enemy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By these words he refers
to the restoration of the people, so that Rachel would again see her posterity
inheriting the promised land. But there is no reason refinedly to dispute here,
whether Rachel rejoiced at the return of her offspring, or whether that calamity
was lamented by her; for the Prophet&#8217;s object was not to shew whether or
not the dead are conscious of our affairs; but he speaks figuratively in order
to render what he said more striking and forcible. It follows, &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">He indeed explains in a few words, but with
sufficient plainness, what he had said. We must always bear in mind the order
which I have pointed out, &#8212; that he first placed before the Jews their
calamity, that they might humble themselves before God; and then he gave them
the hope of return, that they might feel assured that God would be propitious to
them. He now includes both in these few words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there shall be hope in thine
end</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for they<i> </i>embrace the two
clauses, &#8212; that the whole country would lament for a time, and then that
their tears would be turned to laughter and their sorrow to joy: for had the
happiness of the people flowed in one unbroken stream, the word,
&#8220;end,&#8221; would not have been suitable; for it refers to what
terminates. There is then to be understood a contrast between the end and the
beginning. In short, Jeremiah teaches here, that the grievous time, during which
God would afflict his people, was to be borne patiently. But after having bidden
them to continue in a state of suspense, he sets before them a happy
issue.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this passage contains a useful doctrine, &#8212;
that we are not to measure God&#8217;s favor by present appearances, but learn
to keep our minds and thoughts in suspense, while the Lord seems to be angry
with us, and only disheartening terrors meet us, so that we may cherish in our
hearts the hope which the Prophet exhorts us to entertain, and distinguish
between our present state and the end. And on this account it is that the
Apostle, in his Epistle to the Hebrews, while exhorting the faithful to
patience, says that the rod is always at the time grievous to children, but that
correction appears useful, when the end is regarded.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;581211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
12:11) So when we perceive that God is displeased with us, we cannot but feel a
dread, and we desire at the same time to escape from his chastening hand; but,
as I have just said, we ought to direct our thoughts to the end or the issue,
according to what we are taught here:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there shall
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>be hope in thine
end</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF35</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But a question may be here moved, Was there no hope
for the intermediate time, while God was punishing the Jews? the answer is
obvious, &#8212; the Prophet takes hope here for hope accomplished. If any one
calls it actual hope or hope effected, I do not object. But he doubtless
intimates that all the calamities which the Jews would have to endure would at
last end in their deliverance, and would be for their good. We thus see that
hope here, as we have said, is to be taken for hope accomplished.<i> </i>And the
Prophet explains himself, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they
shall return to their own border</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here
by stating a part for the whole he mentions <i>border </i>for the whole country,
as though he had said, &#8220;Ye are now far off from your country, but you
shall again return to that land which has been marked out by certain limits,
even by Euphrates, Egypt, the sea and Arabia;&#8221; for these were the four
borders. It afterwards follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here speaks more distinctly of a blessed
issue, and shews that the punishment by which God had already chastised the
people, and by which he was prepared to chastise the tribe of Judah, was wholly
necessary, which he would give them as a medicine. For as long as we have set
before us the wrath of God, we necessarily, as it has been already said, try to
avoid it, because we wish well to ourselves, and endeavor to remove to a
distance, as much as we can, whatever is adverse to us: hence the punishment
which God inflicts is never pleasant to us, our sorrow in evils and adversities
is never mitigated, nor do we quietly submit to God, unless we direct our minds
to the fruit which distresses and chastisements bring forth. We now then
perceive the object of the Prophet: the Jews always murmured and said,
&#8220;Why<i> </i>does not God spare and forgive us? why does he not deal more
gently with us?&#8221;<i> </i>The Prophet therefore shews, that God had a regard
to the wellbeing of his people in chastising them; for had he indulged them in
their sins, their pride and perverseness would have increased.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The intention then of these words is this, and it is
for this end the Prophet speaks, &#8212; that the Jews might know that all their
punishment, which would have been otherwise bitter and grievous, was a sort of
medicine, by which their spiritual diseases were to be healed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He therefore says,

<i>nud, </i>means to move, to wander, to migrate from one place to another; it
means also to complain, to tell of adversities, though it is often applied to
those whose object is to solace the miserable and the mournful. If any one
prefers the rendering, &#8220;I<i> </i>have heard Ephraim lamenting,&#8221; I do
not object, for there is a sufficient probability in its favor. But it may also
be derived from

nud, </i>as well as from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ddn</font><font face="Palatino"><i>

moved into exile,&#8221; or literally, &#8220;after<i> </i>having
transmigrated,&#8221; that is, after God had driven Ephraim, even the ten
tribes, into exile.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF36</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">After Ephraim then had thus transmigrated, or had
been driven into exile, he then began to say,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast chastised me, and I was
chastened, for I was an untamed bullock: Turn thou me and I shall be turned; for
thou, Jehovah, art my God.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF37</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Prophet, no doubt, as I said
before, meant here to check the murmurs which prevailed among the Jews, who
said, that God was too rigid and severe, he shews not only that they were worthy
of the very grievous punishment they were suffering, but also that it was a
testimony of God&#8217;s favor, that he thus intended to cleanse them from their
sins; for they would have a hundred times grown putrid in their wickedness, had
not God thus reduced them to a sound mind. He at the same time sets forth
Ephraim as an example, that the Jews might resignedly follow their brethren, and
not discontentedly bear their exile, seeing that it had already been profitable
to their brethren. When therefore they perceived<i> </i>that their punishment
was useful to the Israelites, and brought forth good fruit, they ought to have
submitted themselves willingly to God, and not to have murmured against him for
punishing them for their sins, but to have borne their exile as a paternal
correction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he says, &#8220;I<i> </i>have heard
Ephraim,&#8221; &#8212; at what time? This circumstance<i> </i>ought to be
especially noticed, it was after he had <i>transmigrated. </i>When they were
quiet in the land, they<i> </i>were, as it follows, like untameable steers. The
Prophets also use this mode of speaking, when they describe the Israelites
before their dispersion; they call them fat and well fed oxen: affluence
produced luxury, and luxury pride. Thus, then, they kicked, as it were, against
God, according to what is said by Moses,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;My people having
grown fat
kicked.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(Deuteronomy
32:15)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As they were such, it was necessary that they<i>
</i>should be tamed. And to this refers the time that is mentioned: when Ephraim
was forcibly driven from his own country, then he began to acknowledge his evils
and to be touched with a penitent feeling; &#8220;Thou hast chastised
me,&#8221;<i> </i>he says, &#8220;and I was instructed.&#8221; The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rsy</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>iser, </i>means to instruct as well as to chastise, and is applied to
princes, counsellors, fathers, and magistrates. The word chastise is more
restricted in Latin. But
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rsy</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
iser, </i>properly means to teach, and yet often it means to chastise, for that
is one way of teaching or instructing. He then says that he was chastised,
though in a different sense: in the first clause, when he says, &#8220;Thou hast
chastised me,&#8221; he refers to the punishment by which God had humbled his
people; and in the second clause he says, &#8220;I<i> </i>was instructed,&#8221;
that is, &#8220;I begin now at length to become<i> </i>wise;&#8221; for it is
the wisdom even of fools, not to become hardened under their calamities; for
they who become hardened are altogether in a hopeless state. It is the chief
part of wisdom to acknowledge what is right, and willingly to follow it; but,
except we be willing to regard our own good, God will then chastise
us.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF38</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When our diseases are healable, we turn to God; but
the perversely wicked bite and champ the bridle, and contend with God&#8217;s
judgment: But the Prophet here refers to the faithful alone; for punishment has
not the same effect on all indiscriminately. God, indeed, calls all men by
punishment to repentance, so that even the reprobate are without excuse when
they harden their hearts, and profit not under the rod. But punishment is
peculiarly<i> </i>useful to the faithful; for God not only scourges them, but
also, by his Spirit, bends their minds to docility, so that they willingly
suffer themselves to be corrected<i> </i>by him. Hence I said that this clause
properly refers to the faithful, when the Prophet says that Ephraim was
<i>instructed, </i>after having been warned by punishment, to turn himself to
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He compares himself to an untameable steer; for
steers are wanton before they are habituated to the yoke. Such also is the
wantonness of men before God subdues them by various kinds of punishment, and
not only subdues them, but renders them also tractable and submissive. Next week
I shall lecture instead of Beza.</font><br></div>

O grant, that we may profit more and more under thy scourges, and never
perversely harden ourselves, but learn to know that even when thou appearest
rigid, thou hast a regard for our salvation, so that we, turning to thee, may

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIRST</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the last lecture, the Prophet told us that
Ephraim, until he had been chastised by God&#8217;s hand, was like an untamed
bullock, and that, therefore, exile was useful to him. He now adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Turn me, and I shall be
turned</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This second clause seems not to be in accordance with
the former; for the Israelites had before confessed that they had turned, and
now they pray God to turn them. Why is this said? For it seems useless to ask
for what we have already obtained. But the solution is obvious. It may first be
answered, that men never so repent but that they have need of the continual aid
of God; for we must be renewed from day to day, and by degrees renounce the
lusts of our flesh; nor is it in one day that we put off the old man. And when
the Prophet in the Psalms speaks of the deliverance of the people, he says that
it was a miracle, that the people had been restored beyond all
hope;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;We were,&#8221; he
says, &#8220;like<i> </i>those who dream;&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">he afterwards adds,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Turn<i> </i>our
captivity, O Lord,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19B601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
116:1, 4)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and this he said because God had restored but a small
number. The same also happens as to spiritual turning, both with regard to the
whole body and to individual members. We turn, as I have already said, by little
and little to God, and by various steps; for repentance has its progress. There
is, therefore, nothing improper when we say that the Prophet, in the name of the
ten tribes, asks God to go on with his work. But as this explanation is rather
strained, I prefer a simpler view of the words, &#8220;Turn me, and I shall be
turned.&#8221; They mean the same thing as though the Prophet had said,
&#8220;O<i> </i>Lord, this is thy work.&#8221; He does not then simply refer to
a future time, but speaks of God&#8217;s favor, as though he had said, that men
do not turn by their own impulse, but that God, by the hidden power of his
Spirit, turns them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Israelites had before confessed that they had
been profitably chastised by God&#8217;s hand, because punishment had instructed
them; but now he adds that this was the singular kindness of God. But, as we
before observed, punishment is what the elect and the reprobate have in common;
but the end and fruit of punishment is far different; for the reprobate become
more and more hardened, the very reverse of being submissive to God; but the
elect<i> </i>are subdued, for God not only smites them with his rods, but also
tames them within, subdues their pride, and, in a word, bends their hearts to
obedience by his Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand the purpose of the Prophet:
for in the name of the people, he first confesses that punishment, inflicted by
God, had been useful, and secondly, he adds, that it was not through the power
of men that they willingly returned to a right mind, but that God had bent their
hearts by his Spirit, so that they did not become hardened by punishment, nor
obstinately resisted, as the case most commonly is. We hence,<i> </i>then,
conclude<i> </i>that repentance is the work of the Holy Spirit. God, indeed,
invites us, and even urges us by external means to repent; for what is the
design of punishment, but to lead us to repentance? But we must still remember
that were God only to chastise us, it would have no other effect than to render
us inexcusable, for our perverseness could never in this way be corrected. It
is, then, necessary to add the second favor, that is, that God should subdue us
within, and restore us to obedience. This the Prophet testifieswhen he says,
&#8220;Turn me, and I shall be turned,&#8221;<i> </i>as though he had said, that
men indeed turn when God reminds them of their sins, but that they do this not
by their own power, for it is the peculiar work of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He therefore adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thou, Jehovah, art my
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By this clause he intimates that
God favors only his elect with this privilege; as though he had said, that it
does not happen to all indiscriminately that they repent and submit to God when
he punishes them for their sins, but that it is a benefit peculiar to his chosen
people. We ought then especially to notice the reason by which the Prophet
confirms the previous sentence, for we hence learn the manifest difference there
is between the elect and the reprobate; for some rebel and kick against the
goads, and obstinately rush headlong into ruin, but others calmly and quietly
submit to God: the reason is, because some are reprobate and the others are the
elect. It now follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah now proceeds with what he had before briefly
touched upon, even to shew that the punishment inflicted on the Israelites had
not been without its fruit. And this is a doctrine which ought especially to be
known, for we always shun whatever is hard to the flesh; so that if it were
according to our own will, the chastisements of God would never be well received
by us. It is, therefore, necessary to regard the end, as the Apostle reminds us.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;581211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
12:11) Now when we see that God has a regard for our own salvation while
handling us somewhat roughly, our sorrow is mitigated and lessened, especially
when experience proves that punishment is good for us; we then felicitate
ourselves, and give thanks to God that he has not suffered us wholly to perish
in our sins. This is the reason why the Prophet enlarges on this
doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He therefore says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>After thou hast turned me, I
repented</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He confirms what he has
already said, that it is the peculiar work of God when a sinner repents, and
that it cannot be ascribed to human powers, as though men could of themselves
turn to the right way. But how was this done?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>After thou hast turned
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He thus repeats in other words what
he had said, but for the purpose of confirming his previous declaration. The
meaning is, that we are never touched by a serious feeling, so as to be
displeased with our sins, until God himself turns us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence learn how blind the Papists are, who,
speaking of repentance, hold that man, through his own free-will, returns to
God; and on this point is our greatest contest with them at this day. But the
Prophet briefly determines the whole question; for, as he had said before, that
men cannot turn except God turns them, he now adds, that he had found this to be
really the fact, that people had never become conscious of their sins though God
had grievously punished them until they were turned, not by their own free-will,
but by the hidden working and influence of the ttoly Spirit;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>after thou hast turned me, I
repented</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The meaning is, that men never
entertain a real hatred towards sin, unless God illuminates their minds and
changes their hearts; for what is the turning or conversion of which the Prophet
speaks? It is the renewal of the mind and heart. For let its definition be
fetched, as they say, from what is contrary to it; what is turning away? It is
the alienation of the mind and heart from God. It then follows that when we turn
we are converted, we are renewed in knowledge, and then in heart, or in our
affections; both of which the Prophet ascribes to the grace of God, for he says
that the people repented not of their sins until they were turned or converted,
that is, until they were renewed both in mind and heart. Some give this version,
&#8220;After<i> </i>I received consolation;&#8221; but their mistake is easily
confuted by the context; for it immediately follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I was ashamed and also
confounded.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>There is no doubt then but
that here is set forth the displeasure at sin that is felt when the sinner is
terrified by God&#8217;s judgment so as to renounce his vices.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>After I was made known to
myself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, after it was shewn to me,
or, simply, after I knew it, etc. For we may take the meaning to be, After it
was given to Ephraim to know himself, or, after he knew himself. Some give this
version, &#8220;After I was known;&#8221; and so the meaning would be the same
with those words of Paul,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;After ye have
known God, or rather are known by
him.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480409&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Galatians
4:9)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But I fear that this exposition is too refined. I
therefore would rather follow those who give this rendering, After I became
known to myself, or, after the thing was made known to me. The Prophet, no
doubt, commends here the grace of God, because the veil had been taken away from
the eyes of the people, or because they had been cured of their blindness; as
though they<i> </i>had said, that they had long been blind, because they took
delight in their vices, and their whole soul was in a torpid state; for we know
that those who are forsaken by God are wholly insensible,<i> </i>and are as it
were like the beasts. Then the people of Israel confess that they were, for a
time, thus stupid, and that their minds were blinded: they therefore acknowledge
here the grace of God, that he had at length opened their eyes. For they do not
speak here, as we have said, of their virtue or power, but acknowledge that it
proceeded wholly from God&#8217;s gratuitous favor that they
repented.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As then, under the word, turning or conversion, is
included the renewal of the whole soul, so now it is expressly said, that they
were endued with a right mind, because God had taken away the veil by which
their eyes<i> </i>were covered, and had conferred<i> </i>on them new light. The
meaning is, that they were not touched by the true fear of God before they were
endued with a right mind; but at the same time he testifies that it had been
obtained through the peculiar favor of God. We hence see that the Prophet, in
the name of the ten tribes, acknowledges that nothing depended on the free-will
of man, but that a sound mind and a right feeling of the heart is the work of
the Holy Spirit.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF39</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>smiting of the thigh
</i></font><font face="Palatino">means sorrow or grief, which arises from the
fear of God: for as long as we disregard God&#8217;s judgment, Satan must
necessarily fascinate us with his allurements; but when God manifestly shews
that he is our judge, and when our own baseness comes to view, then we begin to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>smite the
thigh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And he adds, what means the same
thing, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I was ashamed and even
confounded</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I wonder why many
interpreters have omitted the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">mg</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
gam, </i>even: they invert the order, and render thus, &#8220;I<i> </i>was
confounded and ashamed.&#8221; But the particle shews that the Prophet enhances
the greatness of the sorrow and shame when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I was ashamed and even
confounded</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because I have borne the reproach
of my youth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He here repeats what he had
said before, even that punishment, sent from above, had done good to the
Israelites. For except they had been thus made ashamed, they would have always
taken delight in their vices; for we see that the wicked flatter and deceive
themselves as long as God spares and shews forbearance towards them. Hence the
Prophet, in the name of the people, says, that punishment had been profitable to
him. But we must bear in mind what we have said, that this fruit altogether
proceeds from the grace of God: for the reprobate, however dreadful the examples
of vengeance which God may exhibit, still remain unbending, nor do they bear
their own reproach, that is, confess that they have sinned. To bear reproach,
then, is peculiar to the elect of God, who have been regenerated by his Spirit;
for they understand the cause of their evils. When we see two diseased persons,
one of whom is insane, and so is insensible as to his disease, and the other
feels his sorrow, and is affected by it: in this case we see some difference.
But we see another difference in others who are diseased; we may therefore
suppose a third case, for it often happens, that he who is affected with sorrow,
does not yet examine into its cause. He then who is healable is one who
understands whence has arisen his disease, and so is ready to obey, and willing
to adopt the necessary remedies. There are also many who rush headlong to their
own ruin; some, indeed, feel their punishment to be bitter, but consider not the
cause of it, that is, that they have provoked God&#8217;s wrath: but they who
are prepared to seek the restoration of health, well know how they have
contracted their disease. Hence<i> </i>the Prophet here says, that they bore
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their
reproach</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>for they not only felt their
sorrow, but also considered its fountain, that is, that they had, by their sins,
provoked the wrath of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By <i>youth </i>he metaphorically points out the time
when the Israelites indulged in excesses; for we know how much ardor belongs to
that age. In the aged there is more moderation; but the young intemperately
indulge themselves. It is therefore a metaphorical expression, by which the
Prophet intimates, that the Israelites had, for a time, been wanton against God,
their petulance being not subdued, for, as he had said, they had been like
untamed bullocks. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">God here complains of the Israelites, because he had
produced so little an effect on them by his great goodness: for the adoption
with which he had favored them was an immense benefit;but by their ingratitude
they had in a manner annihilated that favor. God then here asks, what sort of
people the Israelites had been. But a question makes a thing stronger; for he
who asks a question shews that he speaks not of a thing uncertain, but the
knowledge of which is so conspicuous that it cannot be denied. It is then the
same as though he had said, that Ephraim was unworthy of any honor or esteem,
and that he was no object of delight. We now then perceive what God means in the
beginning of the verse, even that the people were unworthy of any mercy, because
they had abolished, as far as they could, the favor of adoption: for by the word
<i>son, </i>he refers to that special favor, the covenant which he had made with
the seed of Abraham.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the first place, he calls him a son,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;b</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ben,</i> and then a child,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dly</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ilad, </i>which refers to his birth: but by these two names, God here
intimates that they were to him a peculiar people, as he everywhere<i> </i>calls
those his sons who were the descendants of Abraham; for circumcision was to them
a symbol and pledge of the covenant; and so the time is a circumstance that
ought to be noticed, because God does not shew here what the Israelites were
before he had chosen them to be his people. But as I have already said, he
charges them with ingratitude, since the time they had been adopted by him as
his children. He then calls them sons, or children, by way of concession, and
with regard to their adoption, as Jerusalem was called the holy city, because it
was God&#8217;s habitation. There is then a concession as to the name given to
them. But he afterwards adds, that this <i>son </i>was not <i>precious, </i>that
is, worthy of any honor, and that he was not an object of <i>delight; </i>as
though he had said, that he was of a perverse and wicked disposition, so that he
could not take any delight in him, as by another simile he complains in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240221&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah

turned to me into bitterness?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So also now he says, that the Israelites were indeed
his sons, but that they were evil-disposed sons, disobedient sons, sons who only
vexed their father, who wounded his feelings, who filled him with
sorrow.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For from the time I spake in
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>so it is literally. It is commonly
agreed that these words are to be read with those which follow. &#8220;For<i>

<i>bu, </i>or, as some render it, &#8220;concerning him;&#8221; but it may
suitably be rendered &#8220;with him.&#8221; Then they read, in connection with
this, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Remembering I will yet
remember him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage, on account of its brevity, is obscure,
and therefore ambiguous; but the common opinion is this, &#8212; that though
Ephraim was not a child of delight, yet God would be merciful towards him; and
thus they take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>ki, </i>in an adversative sense, &#8220;notwithstanding,&#8221;<i> </i>or
yet: &#8220;Is Ephraim a precious son? Is he a child of delight? yet remembering
I will still remember him;&#8221; as though he had said, that he would not be
prevented by the people&#8217;s wickedness, for he would still pity him
according to his infinite goodness, or that his goodness would surpass their
wickedness. This sense is plausible; yet it may be doubted whether this be the
meaning. Some read the words, &#8220;From the time I spake concerning
him,&#8221; that is, while I now speak of him: but I know not whether this
explanation can stand. I am therefore inclined to the opinion of those who refer
this to threatenings, even that from the time God had spoken against Israel, he
was yet ready to be reconciled to them, according to what is said by the Prophet
Habakkuk,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;In wrath wilt thou
remember mercy.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;350302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Habakkuk
3:2)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this ought to be rather understood of the
covenant, as though God had said, &#8220;From the time I spake with him, I will
remember him;&#8221; that is, that he might shew the reason why he dealt so
mercifully with the people. For as their wickedness and corruption were so
great, a doubt might arise, &#8220;Can God still patiently endure them?&#8221;
Here then our attention is called back to the fountain of gratuitous mercy, even
that God would forgive his people, because he had once chosen
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But still when I narrowly weigh everything, I think
the meaning of the Prophet to be different. I therefore separate the two
clauses, &#8220;From the time I spake with him,&#8221; and, &#8220;Remembering I
will yet remember him;&#8221; for the sentence<i> </i>is harsh, when we say,
&#8220;From the time I spake with him,&#8221; and then add, &#8220;I<i> </i>will
yet remember him.&#8221;<i> </i>But the exposition, the most suitable in my
opinion, is this, &#8220;From<i> </i>the time I spake with him,&#8221; (for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">
means with) that is, I desisted not continually to exhort him to repentance,<i>
</i>and yet I effected nothing; notwithstanding I will still remember him; that
is, &#8220;Though I have found this people<i> </i>very perverse, and though they
have long given many proofs of their obstinacy, for I have spoken to them for a
long time, nevertheless I will still remember them.&#8221; For the people
deserved eternal ruin who had been so often warned; but God declares that he
would still be propitious to them, though he had spoken to them for a time, that
is, a long time; for he had not ceased for a long space of time to exhort that
people by his Prophets, but with no success. So then I read the words,
&#8220;From<i> </i>the time I spake with him,&#8221; separately from what
follows, and connect them with the former clauses, &#8220;Is he a precious son?
Is he a child of delight?&#8221; For he complains that they had been rebellious
and untameable, not only from the time he had only once addressed them and
sought to do them good, but for several ages. He therefore declares that the
people themselves had no hope, because they had been intractable for a long
time. He yet adds, though it was so,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Remembering I will still remember
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF40</font></sup><br></div>

feelings; for the bowels are moved and make a noise under immoderate grief; and
we sigh and groan deeply, when we are pressed down by great sorrow. So also when
God expresses the feelings of a tender father, he says that his bowels made a
noise, because he wished to receive his people again into favor. This, indeed,
does not properly belong to God; but as he could not otherwise express the
greatness of his love towards us, he thus speaks in condescension to our
capacities. It follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He describes what mercy would do, even that God would
at length restore the captives and bring them back from exile to their own
country. There was however mention made previously of his favor, that we may
know that the people were restored for no other reason but because God had mercy
on them. The Prophet then having pointed out the fountain of redemption, passes
on now to the external effect, by which God proved that he was reconciled to his
people. Hence he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>set up for
thee titles</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must first understand why the Prophet speaks thus.
When the Jews were led away into Chaldea, they thought that a return was closed
up against them. Having then given up every concern<i> </i>for their country,
they dwelt among foreign nations, as though they were dead to the land of
Canaan. They knew that they had forfeited that land; but they did not understand
what had been so often said to them by the Prophets, that their punishment was
to be temporary. As they had before disregarded all threatenings, so when God
began to fulminate against them, despair overwhelmed their minds, so that they
did not wish to hear anything about a return. As then they thought that they
were never to return to their own country, they had forgotten the way. As when
one moves to another place where he intends to dwell all his life, he only seeks
to know the way thither, but does not observe the accommodations on the road, in
order to use them again, nor does he take notice which way he goes, whether he
turns here to the right and there to the left; it is enough for him to reach the
place to which he is going; so also it was with the Jews; they had made up their
minds to remain in perpetual exile, they were not therefore solicitous about the
road, so as to remember their journey. Therefore the Prophet says now,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Set up for thee
titles</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or inscriptions; for those who
travel anywhere, if they mean to return, know that such an inn was commodious,
and also that there was so much distance between this town or city and that
village, and in like manner, that the road was straight or turned more to one
side than another. When therefore they think of a return, they attend to such
things as these.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is for this purpose that the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Set up for thee
titles</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, that thou mayest assist
thy memory, as travelers are wont to do, who intend to return by the same way.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Set up
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for thee titles, and raise up for
thee heaps</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or stones, which we call in
our language <i>monioyes; </i>as though he had said, &#8220;Thou<i> </i>indeed
hast hitherto thought that the way has been closed up against thee, so that thou
art to return no more: but God will stretch forth his hand and restore thee to
thy former state.&#8221; We hence see that the similitude is taken from the
common practice of men, but employed for this end, that the Jews might not
despair of their restoration as they had previously
don.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF42</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Apply thy
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> &#8212; </i>he now explains himself
&#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>apply thy heart to the
footpath, to the way through which thou hast
passed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We thus see that the Prophet
becomes the interpreter of his own words, even that the people would return
along the same road, though they expected no such thing. And he again confirms
the same declaration in other words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Return,
thou</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>daughter of Israel, return to
thine own cities</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as though he had said,
<i>&#8220;Though </i>the land has beea deserted for a time, and reduced to
solitude, yet the cities remain, which shall again receive their inhabitants;
and through the wonderful favor of God the land still waits for its
people.&#8221; Though it cast them out for a time, yet the exile was not to be
perpetual, for the cities which remained were still by right the property of the
people, not because they were worthy of them, but because God had prefixed, as
it has elsewhere appeared, a set time for their exile and
punishment.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">As the Prophet had promised a return to the people,
he now reproves especially the Israelites, who looked here and there, and never
could acquiesce in the word of God alone: for it is a common thing with almost
all the unbelieving, that they torment themselves, and, as it were, designedly
contrive for themselves many inquietudes. Since then the Israelites were looking
forward to what might happen, and could not entertain any hope as to their
return, except when some appearance of hope was presented to them, the Prophet
now on this account reproves them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He first calls the <i>people disobedient </i>or
rebellions, for they had often been terrified by threatenings, and God had also
offered them the hope of pardon. As they had been perverse whenever God spared
them, and as they had also rejected all his promises, the Prophet does not
without reason call them disobedient or rebellious. And by circuits<i> </i>or
wanderings, he means those vain speculations with which the unbelieving are wont
to weary themselves; for the word means properly to go around. We may indeed
take it in the sense of wandering, and it is the same thing: but as I have said,
the Prophet most fitly gives the name of circuits to those crooked and tortuous
speculations in which the unbelieving indulged. And there seems to be understood
a contrast between the straight way set before theIn by God, and those
circuitous courses in which miserable men entangle themselves, when they do not
follow God, but are led astray by their own vain devices. Isaiah also makes use
of the same similitude, for he says, that the people were carried away by their
own inventions, so that they fruitlessly wearied themselves, because they did
not proceed in the straight way.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;235710&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
57:10)</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF43</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may hence deduce a useful doctrine, &#8212; that
we are always within the boundary of safety, when we obey God and walk in the
way set before us in his word; but that as soon as we turn aside from the right
way, we are only drawn here and there through windings and strayings, so that
our labor is at last useless and even ruinous.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand the meaning of the Prophet: as
the unbelief of the people was, as it were, a sealed door, so that they did not
receive God&#8217;s promises as to their liberation and return, his purpose here
was to correct this evil, and to reprove the Israelites for wandering and being
disobedient.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For behold Jehovah will
create</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> &#8212; </i>literally, has created;
but the past tense is here to be taken for the future; and it serves to shew the
certainty of a thing when he uses the past tense, as though he was speaking of a
thing already done: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then has
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>created a new
thing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He intimates that the Israelites
acted foolishly in estimating the promise of deliverance according to their own
judgment of things, and the state of things as it appeared to them; for he says
that the favor promised them would be wonderful, for this is what he means by a
<i>new </i>thing, as though he had said, &#8220;Ye<i> </i>indeed judge,
according to your usual manner, of what God promises to you, as to your return,
but it will be a miracle; act not then perversely, by regarding the favor of God
as the common order of nature, for God will surpass everything that is usual
among men.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It ought also to be observed, that what Jeremiah said
of the redemption of the people is to be extended to the eternal salvation of
the Church; for God in a wonderful manner raises the dead, defends and preserves
his Church, and succors her in her troubles. Whenever then the Scripture speaks
of the state of the Church, we ought to ascend above the world, and above our
own conceptions, and to realize the miracle which is hid from
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now follows the miracle,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A woman shall surround a
&#8216;man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Christians, almost with one
consent, explain this of the virgin Mary; and the &#8220;new thing,&#8221; leads
them to this opinion, and probably, also, they were anxious to lay hold on
whatever might seem to refer to the mystery of our salvation. They, therefore,
say that the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>new thing
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of which the Prophet speaks is the virgin
carrying the infant Christ in her womb, and that he is called <i>man,
</i>because he was full of divine power, though he increased according to the
flesh in stature, wisdom, and strength. All this is deservedly laughed at by the
Jews; yet they themselves, as I think, do not rightly understand the meaning of
the Prophet. They apply it to the people of Israel, because they were like a
woman divorced from her husband. They then say, &#8220;A woman shall embrace a
man after having been alienated from him, and prostituted herself to many
adulterers.&#8221; The Jews seem to think that they give the meaning of the
Prophet;<i> </i>but I think otherwise, for there is here a comparison made
between a woman and a man, which they do not consider. For the Prophet does not
speak here simply of a man, but of a strong man; for the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rbg</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>geber, </i>means a man who is brave or courageous. When, therefore, he
compares a woman to a man, I doubt not but the Prophet means that the
Israelites, who were like women, without strength, were destitute of any means
of help; but then<i> </i>he says, that they would be superior in strength to
their enemies, whose power filled the whole world with terror. We, indeed, know
what sort of monarchy Babylon was when the Jews were led into exile. If then we
consider what the Jews at that time were, we must say that they were like weak
women, while their enemies were strong and warlike:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A woman
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall surround a
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF44</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bbs</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>sebab, </i>means not to embrace, but oftentimes to besiege; and it is taken
in many<i> </i>places of Scripture in a bad sense, &#8220;Enemies have
surrounded me.&#8221; When, therefore, a siege is mentioned, the Scripture uses
this word. It is then the same as though the Prophet had said, &#8220;Women<i>
</i>shall bring men into such straits that they shall hold them
captive.&#8221;</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF45</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But he uses the singular number, as
though he had said, &#8220;One<i> </i>woman shall be superior to many men, or
each Jew shall exceed in valor a Chaldean; so the Jews shall gain the upper
hand, though the strength of their enemies be great and terrible.&#8221; This is
what I regard as the meaning of the Prophet; and justly does he set forth this
as a wonderful thing, for it, was a sort of revolution in the world when God
thus raised up his servants, so that they who had enslaved them should become
far unequal to them. It follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

nor is the repetition, as we have said elsewhere, superfluous; for it was
difficult to convince the Jews that what they had already regarded as impossible
could be effected; for by their perverseness they had closed, as it were, the
door against the word of God. As then despair had thus laid hold on them, and
fast bound their minds, it was necessary to dwell at large on the subject, so
that they might at length embrace the promise of deliverance. This is the reason
why the Prophet employed many words on the same subject.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now he makes this preface, that he had his message
from God; and he speaks in his name, so that the incredible thing might be
believed both by the Israelites and the Jews.

<div><font face="Palatino">It was not without reason that the Prophet employed
this mode of speaking; for Jerusalem, we know, was entirely overthrown, and the
Temple pulled down, and even burnt with fire. As then this was a spectacle awful

Sion would again be the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>moment of

<div><font face="Palatino">He proceeds with the same subject, but sets forth the
effect of that favor of which he had spoken, for <i>dwell, </i>he says,<i>
</i>shall the Jews again in the land; that is, they shall rest there and have a
quiet habitation. He adds <i>cities, </i>only to amplify the favor of God as to
the number and multiplicity of men; as though he had said, that not a few would
return, but a vast number of men, sufficient to fill their cities. Now this was
to exceed the hope of all; for when they saw the cities deserted, and the land
almost empty, who would have thought that they would again be filled with
people? But this the Prophet confirms by saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Dwell there shall Judah and all
his cities</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>husbandmen</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>He extends God&#8217;s favor to the country and the villages, as though he
had said, that the land would be filled with inhabitants, not only as to the
fortified towns, but as to the fields.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It often happens that cities are inhabited when there
is any fear or danger from enemies; for they who dwell in cities have walls for
their defense, and mounds and other means of safety. Had then the Prophet spoken
only of cities, he would not have sufficiently set forth the favor of God. Hence
he adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>husbandmen</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>as though he had said, that dwelling in the land would be safe, though there
were no gates, no walls, no defences, for husbandmen would rest secure in their
cottages as though inclosed within walls. We now then understand what the
Prophet means.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some read thus, &#8220;Husbandmen,<i> </i>and they
who go forth with the flock,&#8221; as though the Prophet made a distinction
between husbandmen and keepers of sheep; but this seems to me unsuitable; for I
doubt not but that he means that husbandmen with their flocks and herds would be
secure, having no fear of the inroads of enemies, but living in the land under
the care and protection of God, without apprehending anything adverse or hostile
to them. The meaning is, that the restoration of the Church would be such, that
its state would not be worse than in former ages, and that it would be in a
peaceable and quiet condition, so that the inhabitants of the villages and
country places would not be less secure than those in
cities.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF46</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, were any one to ask, when was this fulfilled? We
must bear in mind what has been said elsewhere, &#8212; that the Prophets, when
speaking of the restoration of the Church, included the whole kingdom of Christ
from the beginning to the end. And in this our divines go astray, so that by
confining these promises to some particular time, they are compelled to fly to
allegories; and thus they wrest, and even pervert all the prophecies. But the
Prophets, as it has been said, include the whole progress of Christ&#8217;s
kingdom when they speak of the future redemption of the people. The people began
to do well when they returned to their own country; but soon after distresses
came as Daniel had predicted. It was, therefore, necessary for them to look for
the coming of Christ. We now taste of these benefits of God as long as we are in
the world. We hence see that these prophecies are not accomplished in one day,
or in one year, no, not even in one age, but ought to be understood as referring
to the beginning and the end of Christ&#8217;s kingdom. It follows, &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">By this verse he removes every doubt, lest any one
should reject what he had promised as to the restoration of the people, because
the Jews and the Israelites were at the time as dead men. He therefore says,

thinks that he drinks,&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">etc. The Prophet employs there the same word, because
there is hardly ever weariness without thirst; we contract thirst by weariness.
Then the soul is said to be

hunger and thirst, and be for a time without food and drink, yet their want

were fainting on account of thirst. It now follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet comes forth, and by his own example
encourages the faithful to be confident, even to recumb on God&#8217;s promise,
as though they really enjoyed<i> </i>already what was as yet hid from them, nay,
as it has been said, incredible. He then says, that he <i>awoke </i>and <i>saw.
</i>This metaphor ought to be applied to a feeling contrary to that by which the
Prophet had been, as it were, astonished. For though the Jews were not yet led
into exile, yet the ten tribes were in that miserable bondage, &#8212; their
kingdom had fallen and perished, and final ruin was nigh the kingdom of Judah.
While then the Prophet was considering these dreadful vengeances of God, he was,
as it were, overwhelmed with sleep. He now says that he <i>awoke. </i>As in
darkness men lose the rigor of their minds, and sleep also prevails, so that
they cannot distinguish between black and white; so also the Prophet confesses
that he was for a time, as it were, lifeless; he then says, that he awoke, that
is, when God&#8217;s favor shone forth, not by its own effect, but in this
prophecy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We then see that he knew as through a mirror what was
yet far distant; for the term of seventy years had not as yet commenced: but
faith, as it is well known, is the seeing of things hid, and the substance of
things absent; for except the word of God obtains in our hearts this assurance,
we betray our unbelief. The Prophet gave a proof of his faith, for he fully
acknowledged that all that had been by God predicted,<i> </i>though far distant,
would yet be accomplished in due time. We now understand why he says, that he
<i>awoke.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he adds,

me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>After having said that he <i>saw

that his sleep had been pleasant to him, while yet he had been sorrowful and
full of fear; for the best alleviator of all sorrow is hope.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">We see that the Prophet brings forward nothing new,
but only animates the Jews with confidence as to their deliverance and their
return. He yet employs another similitude, even that God would again <i>sow
</i>Judah in the land, that he might produce an increase of men, and also of
cattle, and of all kinds of animals. We have said that the land was to be for a
time dreary and forsaken. As God then thus condemned as it were the land, that
all might regard it as given up to desolation and solitude, the Prophet says
that God would cause it to be inhabited again by both men and
beasts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the similitude sets forth still more fully the
favor of God. There is to be understood a contrast between a cultivated and a
deserted land. It is as though one should say, &#8220;They<i> </i>shall sow and
reap on mountains, where corn has never been, where a plough has never been
seen.&#8221; Were any one then to promise a sowing and a harvest in a desert
land, it would be a new thing, and could hardly be believed. Even so does the
Prophet now say, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
sow</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc., </i>as though he said,
&#8220;The<i> </i>land indeed shall for a time be accursed, so that it will not
sustain either men or beasts; but it shall be sown again.&#8221;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will sow
it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,

which might have been asked, &#8220;How<i> </i>can it be that the land will be
again inhabited, since it is now deserted by its inhabitants?&#8221; even
because God <i>will sow </i>it. In this way then, the Prophet answers the
question. But at the same time he exalts the favor of God, as though he had
said, that there would be no other remedy for the barrenness of the land, until
God should cultivate it himself, and scatter seed on it: which is the same as to
say, that the restoration of the land would not be the work of human industry or
power, but of the wonderful power of God.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino">By these words the Prophet confirms what he had said;
for the Israelites and the Jews might have ever made this objection,
&#8220;Why<i> </i>should God promise to be the liberator of his people, whom he
had suffered to be oppressed with so great evils, for it would have been easier
to prevent them?&#8221; The Jews then might have raised this clamor, &#8220;Thou
givest us here the hope of a return, but why does God suffer us to be driven
into exile? why then does he not apply the remedy in time; for now too late he
declares that he will be a help to us after our ruin.&#8221; As then the Jews
thought that a restoration was promised to them unseasonably, the Prophet
says<i> </i>that it was God who chastised them and punished them for their sins,
and that he could also relieve them whenever it pleased him. For had the
Chaldeans, according to their own pleasure, ruled over the Jews, and had
obtained the victory over them, who could have ever hoped that the miserable
men, thus reduced, could have been delivered by God&#8217;s hand? But now the
Prophet shews that there was no reason for the Jews to despair, as though it
were difficult for God to free them from the tyranny of their enemies; for
nothing had happened to them by chance, or through the power of their enemies,
but through the righteous judgment of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive the design of the Holy Spirit in
what the Prophet says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As I have

what is said elsewhere,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">But he employs many words, for the great mass of so
many evils might have plunged the Jews into the abyss of despair. Hence the
Prophet anticipates them, and shews, that though they had been reduced to
extremities, yet so many and so severe calamities could not prevent God from
restoring them, when it seemed good to him. He yet reminds them, that it was not
without cause that they suffered such grievous things; for God takes no delight
in the miseries of his people. The people then ought to have learnt that they
had been guilty of great sins from the fact, that they had been chastised with
so much rigor and severity. He now adds,

God&#8217;s hand to save as well as to destroy. They had disregarded
threatenings as long as God had spared them, and they thought that they could
sin with impunity; and we see how insolently they rejected all the Prophets. But
God had at length shewed by severe proofs how his judgments oughf; to have been
dreaded. He now then inspires them with hope, for his watching would no less

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah proceeds with the same subject, but shews
more clearly how much more abundant and richer the favor of God would be towards
his people than formerly, he then does not simply promise the restoration of
that dignity and greatness which they had lost, but something better and more
excellent. We hence see that this passage necessarily refers to the kingdom of
Christ, for without Christ nothing could or ought to have been hoped for by the
people, superior to the Law; for the Law was a rule of the most perfect
doctrine. If then Christ be taken away, it is certain that we must abide in the
Law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence then conclude, that the Prophet predicts of
the kingdom of Christ; and this passage is also quoted by the Apostles, as being
remarkable and worthy of notice.

<div><font face="Palatino">But we must observe the order and manner of teaching
here pursued. The Prophet confirms what I have before said, that what we have
been considering was incredible to the Jews. Having then already spoken of the
benefits of God, which could have been hardly recognised by the senses of men,
in order to obviate the want of fifith, he adds, that the Lord would manifest
his mercy towards them in a new and unusual manner. We hence see why the Prophet
added this passage to his former doctrine. For had he not spoken of a new
covenant, those miserable men, whom he sought to inspire with the hope of
salvation, would have ever vacillated; nay, as the greater part were already
overwhelmed with despair, he would have effected nothing. Here then he sees
before them a new covenant, as though he had said, that they ought not to look
farther or higher, nor to measure the benefit of God, of which he had spoken, by
the appearance of the state of things at that time, for God would make a<i> new
covenant.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is yet no doubt but that he commends the favor
of God, which was afterwards to be manifested in the fullness of time. Besides,
we must ever bear in mind, that from the time the people returned to their own
country, the faith of those who had embraced the favor of deliverance was
assailed by the most grievous trials, for it would have been better for them to
continue in perpetual exile than to be cruelly harassed by all their neighbors,
and to be exposed to so many troubles. If, then, the people had been only
restored from their exile in Babylon, it was a matter of small moment; but it
behoved the godly to direct their minds to Christ. And hence we see that the
Prophets, who performed the office of teaching after the restoration, dwelt on
this point, &#8212; that they were to hope for something better than what then
appeared, and that they were not to despond, because they saw that they did not
enjoy rest, and were drawn into weary and grievous contests rather than freed
from tyranny. We indeed know what Hagggai says of the future temple, and what
Zechariah says, and also Malachi. And the same was the object of our Prophet in
speaking of the new covenant, even that the faithful, after having enjoyed again
their own country, might not clamor against God, because he did not bestow on
them that happiness which he had promised. This was the second reason why the
Prophet spoke of the new covenant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As before, he now repeats the words, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the days would
come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>in which God would make a covenant
with Israel as well as with Judah. For the ten tribes, as it is well known, had
been driven into exile while the kingdom of Judah was still standing. Besides,
when they revolted from the family of David, they became as it were another
nation. God indeed did not cease to acknowledge them as his people; but they had
alienated themselves as far as they could from the Church. God then promises
that there would be again one body, for he would gather them that they might
unite together, and not be like two houses.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, as to the <i>new </i>covenant, it is not so
called, because it is contrary to the first covenant; for God is never
inconsistent with himself, nor is he unlike himself, he then who once made a
covenant with his chosen people, had not changed his purpose, as though he had
forgotten his faithfulness. It then follows, that the first covenant was
inviolable; besides, he had already made his covenant with Abraham, and the Law
was a confirmation of that covenant. As then the Law depended on that covenant
which God made with his servant Abraham, it follows that God could never have
made a new, that is, a contrary or a different covenant. For whence do we derive
our hope of salvation, except from that blessed seed promised to Abraham?
Further, why are we called the children of Abraham, except on account of the
common bond of faith? Why are the faithful said to be gathered into the bosom of
Abraham? Why does Christ say, that some will come from the east and the west,
and sit down in the kingdom of heaven with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob?
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;421622&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
16:22;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400811&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
8:11) These things no doubt sufficiently shew that God has never made any other
covenant than that which he made formerly with Abraham, and at length confirmed
by the hand of Moses. This subject might be more fully handled; but it is enough
briefly to shew, that the covenant which God made at first is
perpetual.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now see why he promises to the people a <i>new
</i>covenant. It being new, no doubt refers to what they call the form; and the
form, or manner, regards not words only, but first Christ, then the grace of the
Holy Spirit, and the whole external way of teaching. But the substance remains
the same. By substance I understand the doctrine; for God in the Gospel brings
forward nothing but what the Law contains. We hence see that God has so spoken
from the beginning, that he has not changed, no not a syllable, with regard to
the substance of the doctrine. For he has included in the Law the rule of a
perfect life, and has also shewn what is the way of salvation, and by types and
figures led the people to Christ, so that the remission of sin is there clearly
made manifest, and whatever is necessary to be known.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As then God has added nothing to the Law as to the
substance of the doctrine, we must come, as I have already said, to the form, as
Christ was not as yet manifested: God made a new covenant, when he accomplished
through his Son whatever had been shadowed forth under the Law. For the
sacrifices could not of themselves pacify God, as it is well known, and whatever
the Law taught respecting expiation was of itself useless and of no importance.
The new covenant then was made when Christ appeared with water and blood, and
really fulfilled what God had exhibited under types, so that the faithful might
have some taste of salvation. But the coming of Christ would not have been
sufficient, had not regeneration by the Holy Spirit been added. It was, then, in
some respects, a new thing, that God regenerated the faithful by his Spirit, so
that it became not only a doctrine as to the letter, but also efficacious, which
not only strikes the ear, but penetrates into the heart, and really forms us for
the service of God. The outward mode of teaching was also new, as it is evident
to all; for when we compare the Law with the Gospel, we find that God speaks to
us now openly, as it were face to face, and not under a veil, as Paul teaches
us, when speaking of Moses, who put on a veil when he went forth to address the
people in God&#8217;s name.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470313&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 3:13) It is not so, says Paul, under the Gospel, but the veil is
removed, and God in the face of Christ presents himself to be seen by us. This,
then, is the reason why the Prophet calls it a <i>new </i>covenant, as it will
be shown more at large: for I touch only on things which cannot be treated
apart, that the whole context of the Prophet may be better understood. Let us
then proceed now with the words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>covenant</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>which he will make will not be such as he <i>had
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>made
with</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fathers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Here he clearly distinguishes the new covenant from the Law. The contrast
ought to be borne in mind; for no one of the Jews thought it possible that God
would add anything better to the Law. For though they regarded the Law almost as
nothing, yet we know that hypocrites pretended with great ardor of zeal that
they were so devoted to the Law, that they thought that heaven and earth could
sooner be blended together, than that any change should be made in the Law; and
at the same time they held most tenaciously what God had only for a time
instituted. It was therefore necessary that the Law should be here contrasted
with the new covenant, that the Jews might know that the favor in reserve for
them would be<i> </i>far more excellent than what had been formerly manifested
to the fathers. This, then, is the reason why he says, not according to the
<i>covenant, </i>etc.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which I made with their fathers
when I laid hold of their hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc.
</i>Here he shows that they could never have a firm hope of salvation, unless
God made a new covenant. Such was their pride, that they hardly would have
received the favor of God, had they not been convinced of this truth: for this
would have been always in their mouth, &#8220;Did not God shew himself a Father
to his people when he redeemed them? was it not a testimony of his paternal
favor? has he not elevated the condition of the Church, which he designs to be
perpetual?&#8221; They would have therefore rejected the favor of God, had not
the Prophet openly declared that the Law had been and would be still useless to
them, and that there was therefore a necessity for a new covenant, otherwise
they must have perished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive the design of the Prophet; and this
ought to be carefully observed; for it would not be enough to know what the
Prophet says, except we also know why he says this or that. The meaning then is,
that it ought not to appear strange that God makes a new covenant, because the
first had been useless and was of no avail. Then he confirms this, because God
made the first covenant when he stretched out his hand to his ancient people,
and became their liberator; and yet they <i>made void </i>that covenant. The
circumstance as to the time ought to be noticed, for the memory of a recent
benefit ought to be a most powerful motive to obedience. For how base an
ingratitude it was for those, who had been delivered by the wonderful power of
God, to reject his covenant at a time when they had been anticipated by divine
mercy? As then they had made void even at that time the covenant of God, it may
with certainty be concluded, that there had been no time in which they had not
manifested their impiety, and had not been covenant-breakers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I however ruled over
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or was Lord over them. Though some
confine the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ytl[b</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
bolti, </i>to the rule exercised by a husband, and this would not be unsuitable,
as God not only ruled then over his people, but was also their husband, a
similitude which is often used; yet I know not whether this view can be
satisfactorily sustained we ought therefore to be satisfied with the general
truth, that God had the people under his own authority, as though he had said,
that he only used his own right in ruling over them and prescribing to them the
way in which they were to live. At the same time the word covenant, was more
honorable to the people. For when a king enjoins anything on his people, it is
called an edict; but God deals with his own people more kindly, for he descends
and appears in the midst of them, that he may bind himself to his people, as he
binds the people to himself. We hence see, in short, why God says that he
<i>ruled over </i>the people, even because he had purchased them for himself,
and yet he had not enjoyed his own right on account of the untameable and
perverse disposition of the people.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF53</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It ought at the same time to be observed, that the
fault is here cast on the people, that the Law was weak and not sufficiently
valid, as we see that Paul teaches us in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450712&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
7:12. For as soon as the weakness of the Law is spoken of, the greater part lay
hold of something they deem wrong in the Law, and thus the Law is rendered
contemptible: hence the Prophet says here that <i>they </i>had made God&#8217;s
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>covenant
void</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as though he had said, that the
fault was not to be sought in the Law that there was need of a new covenant, for
the Law was abundantly sufficient, but that the fault was in the levity and the
unfaithfulness of the people. We now then see that nothing is detracted from the
Law when it is said to be weak and ineffectual; for it is an accidental fault
derived from men who do not observe nor keep their pledged faith. There are
still more things to be said; but I now, as I have said, touch but briefly on
the words of the Prophet. It then follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He now shews a difference between the Law and the
Gospel, for the Gospel brings with it the grace of regeneration: its doctrine,
therefore, is not that of the letter, but penetrates into the heart and reforms
all the inward faculties, so that obedience is rendered to the righteousness of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A question may however be<i> </i>here moved, Was the
grace of regeneration wanting to the Fathers under the Law? But this is quite
preposterous. What, then, is meant when God denies here that the Law was written
on the heart before the coming of Christ? To this I answer, that the Fathers,
who were formerly regenerated,<i> </i>obtained this favor through Christ, so
that we may say, that it was as it were transferred to them from another source.
The power then to penetrate<i> </i>into the heart was not inherent in the Law,
but it was a benefit transferred to the Law from the Gospel. This is one thing.
Then we know that this grace of God was rare and little known under the Law; but
that under the Gospel the gifts of the Spirit have been more abundantly poured
forth, and that God has dealt more bountifully with his Church. But still the
main thing is, to consider what the Law of itself is, and what is peculiar to
the Gospel, especially when a comparison is made between the Law and the Gospel.
For when this comparison ceases, this cannot be properly applied to the Law; but
with regard to the Gospel it is said, that the Law is that of the letter, as it
is called elsewhere,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450706&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
7:6) and this also is the reason why Paul calls it the letter in 2 Corinthians
3:6,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;the<i> </i>letter
killeth,&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">etc. By &#8220;letter&#8221; he means not what Origen
foolishly explained, for he perverted that passage as he did almost the whole
Scripture: Paul does not mean there the simple and plain sense of the Law; for
he calls it the letter for another reason, because it only sets before the eyes
of men what is right, and sounds it also in their ears. And the word <i>letter
</i>refers to what is written, as though he had said, The Law was written on
stones, and was therefore a letter. But the Gospel &#8212; what is it? It is
spirit, that is, God not only addresses his word to the ears of men and sets it
before their eyes, but he also inwardly teaches their hearts and minds. This is
then the solution of the question: the Prophet speaks of the Law in itself, as
apart from the Gospel, for the Law then is dead and destitute of the Spirit of
regeneration.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will put my Law in their inward
parts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By these words he confirms what
we have said, that the newness, which he before mentioned, was not so as to the
substance, but as to the form only: for God does not say here, &#8220;I will
give you another Law,&#8221; but
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will write my
Law</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, the same Law, which had
formerly been delivered to the Fathers. He then does not promise anything
different as to the essence of the doctrine, but he makes the difference to be
in the form only. But he states the same thing in two ways, and says, that he
would </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>put
</i></font><font face="Palatino">his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>law in their inward
parts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and that he would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>write it in their
hearts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF54</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We indeed know how difficult it
is that man should be so formed to obedience that his whole life may be in
unison with the Law of God, for all the lusts of the flesh are so many enemies,
as Paul says, who fight against God.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450807&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:7) As then all our affections and lusts thus carry on war with God, it is in a
manner a renovation of the world when men suffer themselves to be ruled by God.
And we know what Scripture says, that we cannot be the disciples of Christ,
except we renounce ourselves and the world, and deny our own selves.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400624&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
6:24;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;421426&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
14:26, 27) This is the reason why the Prophet was not satisfied with one
statement, but said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will put
my Law in their inward parts, I will write it in their
hearts.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may further learn from this passage, how foolish
the Papists are in their conceit about free-will. They indeed allow that without
the help of God&#8217;s grace we are not capable of fulfilling the Law, and thus
they concede something to the aid of grace and of the Spirit: but still they not
only imagine a co-operation as to free-will, but ascribe to it the main work.
Now the Prophet here testifies that it is the peculiar work of God to write his
Law in our hearts. Since God then declares that this favor is justly his, and
claims to himself the glory of it, how great must be the arrogance of men to
appropriate this to themselves? To <i>write </i>the Law
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the heart
</i></font><font face="Palatino">imports nothing less than so to form it, that
the Law should rule there, and that there should be no feeling of the heart, not
conformable and not consenting to its doctrine. It is hence then sufficiently
clear, that no one can be turned so as to obey the Law, until he be regenerated
by the Spirit of God; nay, that there is no inclination in man to act rightly,
except God prepares his heart by his grace; in a word, that the doctrine of the
letter is always dead, until God vivifies it by his Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will be to them a God, and
they shall be to me a people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here God
comprehends generally the substance of his covenant; for what is the design of
the Law, except that the people should call upon him, and that he should also
exercise a care over his people? For whenever God declares that he will be our
God, he offers to us his paternal layout, and declares that our salvation is
become the object of his care; he gives to us a free access to himself, bids us
to recumb on his grace, and, in short, this promise contains in itself
everything needful for our salvation. The case is now also at this day the same
under the Gospel; for as we are aliens from the kingdom of heaven, he reconciles
us by it to himself, and testifies that he will be our God. On this depends what
follows, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall be my
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for the one cannot be separated
from the other. By these words then the Prophet briefly intimates, that the main
object of God&#8217;s covenant is, that he should become our Father, from whom
we are to seek and expect salvation, and that we should also become his people.
Of these things there is more to be said again; but I have explained the reason
why I now so quickly pass over things worthy of a longer explanation. He adds,

difference between the old and the new covenant, even that God, who had
obscurely manifested himself under the Law, would send forth a fuller light, so
that the knowledge of him would be commonly enjoyed. But he hyperbolically
extols this favor, when he says that no one would have need of a teacher or
instructor, as every one would have himself sufficient knowledge. We therefore
consider that the object of the Prophet is mainly to shew, that so great would
be the light of the Gospel, that it would be clearly evident, that God under it
deals more bountifully with his people, because its truth shines forth as the
sun at noon-day. The same thing Isaiah promises, when he says that all would
become the disciples of God.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;235413&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
54:13) This was indeed the case also under the Law, though God gave then but a
small taste of heavenly doctrine: but at the coming of Christ he unfolded the
treasures of wisdom and knowledge, so that under the Gospel there is the
perfection of what had been begun; for we know that the ancient people were like
children, and hence God kept<i> </i>them in the rudiments of knowledge: now, as
we are grown up, he favors us with a fuller doctrine, and he comes, as it were,
nearer to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence, he says, No

fF55</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I have said that the Prophet here
amplifies the favor of God. But we find that some fanatics have ignorantly and
foolishly abused this passage, seeking to put down teaching of every kind, as
the Anabaptists in our day, who reject all teaching; and flattering themselves
in their ignorance, they proudly boast that they are endued with the Spirit, and
say, that dishonor is done to Christ, if we are still disciples, because it is
written as one of the praises and encomiums given to the new covenant, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>no one shall teach his neighbor
any more</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And hence it has also
happened, that they are inebriated with strange and horrible doctrines: for the
devil, when they become swollen with so much pride, can fascinate and delude
them as he pleases; and their own pride also so leads them astray, that they
invent dreams; and many unprincipled men have drawn aside this passage to serve
their own purposes. For when they boast themselves to be prophets, and persuade
the simple that they are so, they hold many attached to themselves, and derive
gain by this sort of boasting.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet here does not mean inspiration, nor
does he exclude the practice of teaching, as I have already said; he only shews
to us the superior brightness of the gospel light, as God, under the Law, did
not so perfectly teach his people as he does us at this day. And hence is that
saying of Christ,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Blessed<i> </i>are the eyes which
see the things which ye see, and the ears which hear the things which ye hear;

<div><font face="Palatino">for the Prophet there intimates that the Fathers had
indeed some light, but not such as we have. In short, we ought to bear in mind
the comparison, of which mention was made yesterday, even that God held his
people in suspense with the hope of a better state.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And that we may no farther seek an explanation, let
us carefully weigh the words; for it is not simply and without exception said,
&#8220;No<i> </i>one shall teach his neighbor,&#8221; but it it is added,
<i>&#8220;Saying,</i> <i>Know ye Jehovah.&#8221; </i>We hence see that the
Prophet promises knowledge, so that they might be no longer alphabetarians; for
these words, &#8220;Know<i> </i>ye Jehovah,&#8221; point out the first elements
of faith, or of celestial doctrine. And, doubtless, if we consider how great was
the ignorance of the ancient people, they were then only in the elements. He who
is at this day the least among the faithful, has so far advanced, that he knows
much more clearly what pertains chiefly to salvation than those who were then
the most learned. The meaning then is, that all God&#8217;s chosen people would
be so endued with the gift of knowledge, that they would no longer continue in
the first elements.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, were any one pertinaciously to urge this one
clause, it would be right to set before him a passage in Isaiah, for he
certainly speaks of the kingdom of Christ, when he says,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Lay<i> </i>hold shall each on the
hand of his neighbor, and say, Come, let us ascend into the mountain of the
Lord, and he will teach us his ways,&#8221; etc.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
2:3)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, let us reconcile these two prophecies. The
design of both is to set forth the favor of God, manifested by Christ at his
coming. The one passage says, &#8220;No one will teach his neighbor;&#8221; and
the other, &#8220;Lay<i> </i>hold will each on the hand of his neighbor, and
say, Let us come and ascend into the mountain, that Jehovah may teach us.&#8221;
Now the way of reconciling them is this, &#8212; that Jeremiah says, that the
people would not be so ignorant under the new covenant as to stand in need of
the first principles of truth; but that Isaiah says, that each would lay hold on
the hand of his neighbor, that they might mutually help one another, so as to
attain the knowledge of God&#8217;s law. The question is thus solved; and we, at
the same time, see how remarkable is the benefit with which God favors his
people, as he thus makes himself familiarly known to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All shall know me, from the least
to the greatest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He does not mean that
knowledge would be in all in an equal measure. Experience indeed proves this to
be false; and further we know, that God has testified from the beginning, as
Paul also reminds us,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
12:2, 3) that the measure of his gifts is according to his good pleasure. But
the Prophet means, that those who are the least or the lowest among God&#8217;s
people shall be endued with so much light of knowledge that they will be almost
like teachers. To the same purpose is the prophecy of Joel,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Prophesy<i>
</i>shall your sons, your daughters shall see visions, and your old men shall
dream dreams.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;290228&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Joel
2:28)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He promises that there would be everywhere prophets
and teachers, because the grace of God would be at that day more abundant; and
these things ought ever to be understood comparatively. Though, then, many are
now ignorant among the children of God, and among those who are really of the
number of the faithful, yet if we consider how great was the obscurity of the
Law, those who are at this day the least among the disciples, are not otherwise
than prophets and teachers. And for this reason Christ says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;He who is least in
the kingdom of heaven,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">is greater
than John the Baptist,&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">who yet was superior to all the Prophets.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401111&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
11:11) John the Baptist was, in his office, exalted above all the Prophets, and
he excelled them in knowledge; and yet the least of those who professed the
Gospel and bore testimony to it, was greater, says Christ, than John the
Baptist. And this is not to be applied only to them individually, nor be
confined to them, but rather to the clear and plain doctrine which the Gospel
conveys, according to the passage we quoted yesterday, where Paul says that
there is now no veil intervening, but that we are allowed to see God, as it
were, face to face in the person of Christ.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470318&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 3:18)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I well forgive their sins,
and their iniquities will I remember no
more</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Prophet, no doubt, shews here
the foundation of God&#8217;s kindness, even that he would receive the people
into favor by not imputing to them their sins. If we then seek for the origin of
the new covenant, it is the free remission of sins, because God reconciles
himself to his people. And we hence conclude, that there is no other cause that
we can imagine, why God appeared in his only-begotten Son, and manifested so
great a bounty: for the Prophet here reduces to nothing all the glory of the
flesh, and lays prostrate all merits, when he says, that God would be so
bountiful to his people as to become propitious to them, freely to remit their
sins, and not to remember their iniquities. This passage, then, cannot properly
be taken as referring to the perpetual remission of sins, though this he
included in the general doctrine; but we must bear in mind the design of the
Prophet, which was to shew, that God from the beginning, with regard to his
Church, was moved by no other cause than a desire to abolish
sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Apostle, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, gives
rather a refined interpretation of this passage, for he dwells on the word
<i>more,
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">d[</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
od. </i>He says, that under the New Testament God forgives iniquities, because
expiation has been made, so that there is no more need of sacrifices. For he
assumes the opposite idea, that God remembered iniquities until he made the new
covenant. If he remembered sins, he says, until he made a new covenant, it is no
wonder that he then required daily sacrifice to propitiate him: but now under
the New Testament he remembers them no more. Then sacrifices cease, because
there is now no need of satisfaction when sins are forgiven. He hence concludes,
that we have been so expiated by the blood of Christ, and so reconciled to God,
that confidence as to our salvation ought to give us an entire rest. But we
ought to bear in mind what I have said, that the Prophet here expressly, and in
the first place, speaks of the beginning of the mercy and grace which God
promises; he therefore declares that God would be so kind and so gracious as not
to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>remember
iniquities</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What, then, does the particle <i>more </i>intimate?
Even that God had for a time been angry with his people, and visited their sins
with judgment. For God is said to call our sins to remembrance, he is said to be
angry with us, he is said to be the avenger of our iniquities, when he punishes
us, when he gives evidences of his severity and of his vengeance. Whenever then
God severely handled his people, he seemed to remember their iniquities; but
when he made the new covenant, all iniquities were then buried, and cast, as
another Prophet says, into the depths of the sea.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;330719&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Micah
7:19) Then the Apostle misapplied the testimony of the Prophet: by no means; for
he wisely accommodated it to the subject he was discussing: what God promises,
that he would not any more remember iniquities, after having made the new
covenant, was accomplished through the coming of Christ. Then Christ alone has
effected this &#8212; that our iniquities should no more be remembered before
God. Hence also we easily learn what the Apostle intended to prove, even that
sacrifices cease when sins are expiated. These things indeed harmonize well
together, and there is nothing forced or too refined.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, the Prophet does not here discuss the whole
question respecting the difference between the Old and New Testament, but only
takes this as granted, that the grace of God would be more abundant than
formerly, in order that the faithful, supported by hope, might patiently endure
their evils and most grievous trials with which they had to contend, and not
despond until Christ was manifested, as we said yesterday. Here, then, he speaks
of the grace of regeneration, of the gift of knowledge, and at the same time
promises that God would be propitious to his people in a different and more
perfect way than he had been in former times. But the Apostle in that Epistle
seems to apply this to ceremonies, because these things are connected together;
that is, the abrogation of ceremonies and the regeneration of the Spirit which
is promised here. Then the Apostle does not wrest the words of the Prophet; but
as he commends the new covenant, which was to be more excellent than the Law, he
hence concludes, that it is no wonder that ceremonies were not to continue but
for a time. For he assumes this principle, that a new covenant was to succeed
the old: then some change was necessarily to be. He assumes also that the new
covenant was opposed to the old, and that the old was subject to destruction.
The Jews could not endure any change in the types, for they would have them to
remain the same. But the Apostle says that it is nothing strange that a thing
should decay; for God, he says, does not certainly without reason call that
covenant old which he made by Moses; then it will not always continue valid.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;580813&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
8:13) Since it is so, it cannot be inconsistent with the truth and faithfulness
of God, that the ceremonies should cease as to their use, while the Law itself
remained unchanged. We now then see that the Apostle faithfully interpreted the
design of the Prophet by accommodating his testimony to the abrogation of
ceremonies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as I have to explain only the words of the
Prophet, there is no need to speak further of the difference between the Old and
New Testament, that is, in what particulars they differ; for the Old and New
Testament differ also in other things. But the Prophet, as I have said, thought
it sufficient to touch on this point, &#8212; that something better was to be
hoped at the coming of Christ than what the Fathers in all ages had found. And
thus, as I have said, he sought to alleviate the sorrow of the faithful, whom
God exercised with hard trials before Christ was manifested in the
flesh.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, the Law and the Gospel form a contrast like
Moses and Christ. Then the New Testament is more excellent than the Law, as
Christ excels Moses. But we must come to a passage in John, that we may more
fully understand why the Prophet says that the grace of the new covenant would
be different from that, of the old. John says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The Law was given
by Moses, but grace</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and truth came
by Jesus Christ.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
1:17)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">John seems there to leave nothing to the Law but an
evanescent shadow. For if Christ only brought truth to us, then there was no
truth in the Law, and there was no grace in the Law; but this seems to east a
reproach on the Law. Now this question was in part answered yesterday. But as I
wish to finish this passage, let it be briefly observed, that whenever the Law
is thus extenuated, it is only that the benefit of Christ may be set forth, so
that we may know how invaluable is God&#8217;s mercy which appears in his
only-begotten Son.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Were now any one to object and say, &#8220;But<i>
</i>why had he previously published the Law? and why did he command it to be
reverently received, if it was without grace and truth?&#8221; To this I answer,
according to what I said yesterday, that the Law was not destitute of those
benefits which we at this day receive under the Gospel, but that these benefits
were then, as it were, adventitious, and that they do not properly belong to the
Law; for if the Law were separated from the Gospel, it would be the same as if
one was to separate Moses from Christ. If Moses be regarded, not as opposed to
Christ, he was the herald and witness of God&#8217;s paternal kindness towards
his people; his doctrine also contained promises of a free salvation, and opened
to the faithful the door of access to God. But if Moses be set in opposition to
Christ, he becomes the minister of death, and his doctrine leads to destruction;
for the letter, as Paul in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 3:6, calls it, killeth, &#8212; how so? Because whosoever is
attached to Moses departs from Christ; and Christ alone possesses in himself the
fullness of all blessings. It then follows, that nothing remains in Moses when
considered in himself. But God promised salvation to his ancient people, and
also regenerated his chosen, and illuminated them by his Spirit. This he did not
do so freely and extensively as now. As then God&#8217;s grace is at this day
more abundant, it is justly extolled in high terms by all the Prophets; and
then, as I have already said, whatever God at that time conferred, was, as it
were, adventitious, for all these benefits were dependant on Christ and the
promulgation of the Gospel. Let us now proceed, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms the promises which we have been
considering; for it was difficult to believe that the people would not only
recover what they had lost, but also be made much more happy; for the Church was
then wholly in a desponding state. It was not then an easy matter to raise, as
it were, from the lowest depths a miserable people, and to comfort them so that
they might overcome their dreadful trial; for the disorder of the Church was
such, that had it been raised a hundred times from the dead, it might again be a
hundred times crushed into death, for there still remained for it most grievous
evils in future. This is then the reason why the Prophet dwells at large on
proving the same thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says in the person of God, &#8220;I am he who
created the sun, the moon, and the stars; the regular order of things in
creation still continues, for the sun performs its course, and so does the
moon.&#8221; He speaks, indeed, of their diurnal course, for we know that the
Prophets spoke popularly, and according to the common notions. Had they
philosophized, as astrologers do, and spoken of the monthly course of the moon,
and of the annual course of the sun, they could not have been understood by the
common people. They were, therefore, satisfied to state things which even
children could comprehend, even that the sun made its circuit daily round the
world, that the moon did the same, and that the stars in their turns followed;
so that the moon holds the first place in the night among the stars, and that
the sun rules during the day. &#8220;I am the Lord,&#8221; he says, &#8220;who
have fixed this order of things which still remains:&#8221;<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I cut
</i></font><font face="Palatino">or divide
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>do its
waves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.&#8221;</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He mentions things which are contrary, but not
inconsistent, though different. For the course of the sun, moon, and stars is

changeable.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF56</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Then in the heavens we find an order so
arranged and regulated, that nothing deviates from its appointed course. But in
storms and tempests God seems as though he would shake the world and overturn
what appears otherwise immovable; for even the very rocks, as it were, tremble
when the sea is violently stirred up; and yet God calms the very sea, and thus
puts an end to storms and tempests, so that there ever appears to be a stability
and a perpetuity in nature. He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If removed shall these laws be
from my presence, the seed of Israel shall also
fail</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, &#8220;As certain as is
the stability of the order of nature, seen in the course of the sun and the
moon, and in the turbulent sea, so certain will be the deliverance of ray
Church, nor can it ever be destroyed.&#8221; The tempest on the sea seems to
shake the world, and yet the world remains fixed. The sun and moon, when they
rise, might overwhelm the whole earth; for we know that the sun is much larger
than the earth. While so large a body, and almost immeasurable, hangs over our
heads, and rolls on so swiftly, who ought not to be afraid? Yet the sun proceeds
in its course, and the earth remains firm, because it so pleases God. There is,
therefore, no reason to fear that the safety of the Church should ever fail, for
the laws or decrees of nature shall never cease; that is, God, who has from the
beginning governed the world, will not disregard the welfare of his Church, for
whose sake the world has been created.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nor, indeed, is it a matter of wonder, that the
safety of the Church is here shewn to be so secure, for it may justly be
preferred even to the fixed course of the sun and of the moon, and to other
institutions of nature. But God deemed it enough in this place to use this
comparison, according to what is said in the Psalms, where the sun and the moon
are called his faithful witnesses in heaven.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;198936&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
89:36, 37) But there also the covenant is spoken of, which God was about to make
with his people through his only-begotten Son. He mentions the moon as his
witness in heaven; but as I have already said elsewhere, he raises us far above
the world and above all the elements, yea, above the sun and the moon, when he
treats of the certainty of our salvation; and, doubtless, the condition of the
Church does not depend on the state of the world; for it is said in another
place,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;They<i> </i>shall

<div><font face="Palatino">And the Prophet there compares the heavens to
garments, which wear out by use, and at length become useless; but the condition
of the Church, he says, is far different. He does not, indeed, express these
words; but after having said, &#8220;Thou, O God, art the same from
eternity,&#8221; he comes to the eternity of the Church, &#8220;Thy
children&#8217;s children shall endure.&#8221; We now see that the Church has
the preference over the whole world. But God had a regard in this place to the
weakness of his people, when he said that his grace to his people would be as
sure and certain as the institutions of nature. Some refer the last clause in
verse 35

even that it would be impossible for God wholly to forget his covenant, but that
he would again gather his people. Exile might indeed appear as a permanent
death; and thus the truth of God might have been brought to nothing; and the
covenant could not have been made void without giving the people a sort of right
to complain, that they had been deceived.<i> </i>For we know, that though a
condition was added to the covenant, yet it was not founded on the integrity of
men; and hence it is said, that God is not a liar, though all the Jews were
perfidious.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:3, 4) Then the Prophet teaches us here, that though God had severely punished
the sins of the people, and had resolved to punish them in future, even so as to
destroy their city, there would yet be a place for mercy after the people had
been chastised.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He had said before that God&#8217;s covenant with
Abraham&#8217;s children could no more fail than the laws of nature: he now

strange and impossible things, that we may know that he will at length be
reconciled to his people after having justly punished them. And this promise
could not have afforded any consolation to hypocrites, because God does not
include the whole seed of Abraham, but says, that he would not allow the whole
seed of Abraham to perish, for some remnant would continue, according to what is
said by Isaiah,</font><br></div>

discussion, whether the center of the earth can be found out. The philosophers
do indeed bring some probable reasons as to the extent of the heavens, and the
dimension of the earth is also conjectured by them. But the Prophet&#8217;s
purpose was to declare, according to the common and popular mode of speaking,
that God&#8217;s mercy would be perpetual and immeasurable towards the children
of Abraham, like the immensity of the earth and the heavens, which exceeds the
comprehension of the human mind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On account of all the things
which they have done</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, though
they have deserved to die eternally a hundred times, I will yet have a regard to
my covenant and my mercy. The Prophet then designedly sets before us here the
sins of the people, that we may know that God&#8217;s mercy would be very great,
as that the whole mass of so many evils would not hinder God to forgive them.
This is the reason why he says,

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet speaks of the rebuilding of the
city. I doubt not but that his object was to shew them that the largeness and
splendor of the city after the return of the people would not be less than it
had been under David in its most flourishing condition. We must, however, first
speak of the words before we proceed to the subject.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, the days are coming, saith
Jehovah, and built shall be the city</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It
was not as yet destroyed; but the Prophet intimated that its utter ruin was nigh
at hand; he therefore makes now their hope to depend on God&#8217;s mercy alone,
as to the deliverance of the people from exile:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Built
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be the city to Jehovah from
the tower of Hananeel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. This tower
was, no doubt, placed in the wall of the city. Almost the same prediction is
found in Zechariah 14:10, though there is some diversity in the words; but both
the Prophets refer to the same thing. Zechariah&#8217;s object was to animate
the people under this circumstance, because the beauty, greatness, and extent of
the city did not at first correspond with what it had formerly been. He then
promises that its glory would at length be the same as it had been; and he names
there the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tower of
Hananeel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Jeremiah adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the gate of the
corner</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The corner,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnph</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
ephene, </i>is in the singular number; but in Zechariah it is
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ynph</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
ephenim, </i>in the plural; and it is thought that corners or corner is thus
called metaphorically, because a corner shews two faces while it stands out, and
thus two parts appear; but whether it be the gate of the corner or of the
corners, it makes but little difference.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yet go forth shall the line of
measure before him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some apply this to
the gate, because from the gate the line was to be extended to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the hill Gareb, and go round to
Goath</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Of these names of places I cannot
say much, for we do not know the ancient situation of the city; and the Jews
themselves, when they make conjectures<i> </i>about these uncertain things, shew
only their own ignorance. However, the greater part of interpreters understand
this, &#8212; that the city was to be large, as though God promised that he
would extend it beyond the walls; and this they illicit from the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">axy</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
itsa, </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>go forth shall the
line</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or cord,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of
measure</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But when the Prophet says
<i>yet, </i>he compares the ancient greatness of the city with that which he
perceives it to be hereafter. Then Zechariah seems to promise that it would be
such a city as would contain the same measure; for he says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Inhabited shall
the city be under itself,&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">or in its own place.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;381206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
12:6) As then Zechariah promises that the city would occupy the same place as
formerly, I do not conclude anything else from the words of our Prophet,
especially as the particle <i>yet </i>intimates the same thing. When it is said
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>I apply this to God and not to the
gate; for mention is previously made of God,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Built shall be the city to
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I have no doubt but that the
Prophet here bids the Israelites to raise up their eyes to God, that they might
expect from him what was incredible according to the comprehension of men and of
the flesh: then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, when God restores the
city, then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go forth shall the

to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the hill Gareb, and surround
Goath</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the whole
valley</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some read, &#8220;the whole
valley shall be holiness to Jehovah:&#8221; and it may be suitably taken, that
all the places near to the city were to be holy to God; but this verse may be
connected with the preceding, as though he said, extended shall be the line to
the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whole valley of the carcases
and of the ashes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;&ccedil;d</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
dashin, </i>means ashes and fatness; but here it is to be taken for ashes; and
it is thought that the place was so called, where they were wont to throw the
ashes gathered from the altar, after the sacrifices were burnt: as then there
was there a great heap of ashes, the place had this name given to it. Another
place was also called the place of carcases, because there a host of enemies had
been slain by an angel, in the reign of Hezekiah. As then a great and a
memorable slaughter had taken place there, it is thought that it received this
name, in order that God&#8217;s favor might remain known to posterity. If then
this name became the monument of God&#8217;s favor, Hezekiah, I have no doubt,
was the cause of it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is then added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and all the regions to the brook
Kidron</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is probable enough that the
places here named were outside of the city, for we know that the brook Kidron
was not within the city. Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the corner of the gate of the
horses</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is thought that through this
gate went forth the chariots of the king when he wished to exercise his horses.
It might have been the market-place for horses. Conjectures only have place
here; for no one knows of a certainty whether the king had a place of exercise
for his horses. But this gate looked towards the east. He says that all the
places would be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>holiness to
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and then he promises them a
quiet and a perpetual condition,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It shall not be cut off nor
destroyed any more for ever</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for which
it is said by Zechariah, &#8220;there shall be no more
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;rj</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
cherim, </i>destruction.&#8221;</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF57</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see the design of the Prophet: after having
spoken of the return of the people, he adds that the city would again become
splendid and large, as it had been; for the land continued in a state of
disorder until the restoration of the city, as God had there chosen a habitation
for himself. And as the Temple had been built there, it behoved the Israelites,
wherever they dwelt, ever to direct their eyes to the Temple and the sanctuary
of God, that they might live under his protection. Except, then, the city had
been built again, the goodness of God could not have been really enjoyed; for a
sort of desolation would have otherwise ever presented itself to the eyes of the
people, as the city was as it were the banner under which God protected them.
This then is the reason why the Prophet expressly announced this prophecy
respecting the future restoration of the city.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, when he says that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>city would be built to
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he intimates what was
especially expected by the Jews, that that city would again be holy; for if it
only flourished in wealth and power like other cities, it would have been but a
small comfort to the Israelites. But he points out here a difference between
Jerusalem and all heathen cities; for God was, as it were, the architect of that
city, as it is said in the Psalms,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;He himself founded
it,&#8221;<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;198705&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
87:5)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and further,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;His<i>
</i>foundations are on the holy mountains,&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and this ought to be understood of himself.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;198701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
87:1) The meaning is, that God would again care for that city, as the Temple
would become as it were his royal throne and earthly sanctuary. At the same time
when the Prophet affirms that the extent of the city would not be less than it
had been, we see that this prophecy must necessarily be referred to the kingdom
of Christ: for though Jerusalem before Christ&#8217;s coming was eminent and
surrounded by a triple wall, and though it was celebrated through all the East,
as even heathen writers say that it excelled every other city, yet it was never
accomplished, that the city flourished as under David and
Solomon.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF58</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We must then necessarily come to the
spiritual state of the city, and explain the promise as the grace which came
through Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must especially notice what is said, that it
would be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>holiness to
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and also that no ruin or
destruction would be dreaded any more. Had the condition of the elect people
been the same as that of other nations, the promise of restoration would have
been small and of no great moment; for it would have been better for them to
dwell in exile where they inhabited a pleasant and fertile country. But the
Prophet here commends a privilege with which God had favored the children of
Abraham above all other nations, when he adopted them as his peculiar people.
There is however to be understood an implied contrast between the profanation
which then prevailed, and the sanctification which is here promised. The Jews
had so polluted the land that it differed nothing from other countries; and God,
as Ezekiel says, had thence migrated,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;260806&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
8:6) and we know that the Temple was called by the prophets the den of robbers,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240711&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
7:11) and that the city was also compared to Sodom and Gomorrah.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:10) Hence the Prophet here promises that the city, with its whole vicinity,
would be holy to God, because God would cleanse it from all the defilements by
which it had been polluted: and he also claims this as his own work, for to
sanctify is a work peculiar to himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The promise of perpetual favor is added, as it is
also done by Zechariah; for it would not be sufficient to have God&#8217;s mercy
promised to us for a short time, except its perpetuity were secured. The Prophet
then promises now that the course of God&#8217;s benefits would be permanent;.
The city indeed was again destroyed by Titus, and at length wholly demolished by
Adrian; but this fact does not militate against this promise; for as we have
said, God gave some taste of his favor in the external aspect of the city until
Christ came; but after Christ was manifested, the heavenly Jerusalem became the
object to be sought, for all the types and shadows then ceased. The perpetuity
then of which the Prophet speaks, is that which corresponds with the character
of Christ&#8217;s kingdom, and is therefore spiritual. Moreover, this passage
teaches us that the Church will be perpetual, and that though God may permit it
to be terribly shaken and tossed here and there, there will yet be ever some
seed remaining, as long as the sun and the moon shall shine in the heavens, and
the order of nature shall continue; so that all the elements, everything we see
with our eyes, bear evidence to the perpetuity of the Church, even that it will
ever continue: for though Satan and all the world daily threaten its ruin, yet
the Lord will in a wonderful manner preserve it to the end, so that it will
never perish. This is the import of the passage. Another prophecy
follows.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here declares, that though he was shut up
in prison, the Word of God was not bound, and that he himself was not less loose
and free in his confinement than if he rambled through the whole city and
visited all the lanes and the streets. He then did not desist from his office<i>
</i>as a Prophet, though he was cast into prison. And thus we see that the
course of heavenly truth cannot be impeded, how much soever the world may rage
against all its ministers, and bind them in order to make them mute: and then
also we see here that the constancy of the Prophet was invincible, because he
was not cast down with fear, though he was a captive and not beyond the reach of
danger; for we find that even then he proceeded in the discharge of his
office.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He points out then the circumstances of that time,
and not without reason, when he says, that he was then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shut up in
prison</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and also mentions the year, even
the tenth of Zedekiah and the eighteenth of king
Nebuchadnezar.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF59</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It was about the end of the ninth year
that the army of Nebuchadnezar came up to Jerusalem; the city was besieged for
two months in that year. The tenth year followed, in which this vision was given
to the Prophet. The siege continued for a year and a half; but there was some
interruption; for the Egyptians came to its aid. Thus for a short time, while
the Chaldeans went to meet them, it had some liberty. But the Egyptians, as we
shall hereafter see, were forced to retire in disgrace, and afterwards suffered
punishment for their audacity and rashness. It was then about the middle of the
siege that God, as we shall see, foretold to the Prophet the future return of
the people. But though God shewed a regard for the miserable exiles, he yet at
the same time confirmed what he had previously said of his future vengeance; for
the people could not be restored before they had been driven into exile. It was
indeed a dreadful instance of hardness and obduracy, that having been so often
scourged they received no benefit. They had experienced the heavy judgment of
God under Jehoiakim, and also under Jeconiah; but the memory of these calamities
had soon vanished, and they lived as securely as though they had never heard a
word from the mouth of Jeremiah: and he was not the only one who had threatened
them, but there were before him Isaiah and others, and at the same time with him
was Ezekiel, who had been exiled into Chaldea. Then from the number of years we
conclude<i> </i>how great must have been the obstinacy of the
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the same time we must observe how seasonable was
this prophecy for alleviating the minds of the godly, as they were not far from
extreme calamity; for it was in the eleventh year of Zedekiah and in the fourth
month that the city was taken and demolished, the people driven into exile, and
the Temple burnt. Then there were not more than six or seven months, perhaps, to
the time of their utter ruin; there is indeed no mention made here of the month
in which the Prophet received the vision, but the tenth year is only mentioned.
Now, the city was taken at the beginning of the eleventh year, as we have
stated. Hence then comes more fully to light the extreme perverseness of the
people; for while the enemy surrounded the city, they held Jeremiah captive. He
had already foretold many years past what experience then taught them to be
true. For forty years he had not ceased to cry out and to strive by warning,
exhorting, and threatening them to lead them to repentance. As then nothing new
happened to them, and as they found by the evils which came on them that
Jeremiah had been a true and faithful servant of God, what was their object in
shutting him up in prison? was not this to carry on war with God? for what had
they to do with Jeremiah? He had not evidently acted a private part, nor had he
only dreamt of what he had so often foretold them. Then they did not fight with
a mortal man, but like the giants they dared to raise up their horns against God
himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For the same reason also, he calls himself a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Prophet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>This indeed he often did, but there is no doubt but that the indignity
offered to him is pointed out, that even at the time when the Chaldeans
surrounded the city with their army, Jeremiah the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Prophet
</i></font><font face="Palatino">was shut up in the court of the prison. He
might have only said, that Jeremiah was shut up, but for honor&#8217;s sake he
assumed the title of a Prophet, that hence might appear more evidently the
baseness of the people&#8217;s contumacy, that though they perceived that God
was angry with them, they yet ceased not from their presumption; for they then
held the Prophet in prison as though they were fighting with God himself. We
know that fools, according to the old proverb, being chastised, become wise. If
then the Jews had a particle or a spark of wisdom, they might have been so
subdued by evils and calamities as to cast aside their haughtiness and
obstinacy. But we see that they were untameable, and through a mad fury
persisted in their wickedness; for though besieged by their enemies, they yet
attempted to hold God as it were captive in the person of his
servant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>court
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of the prison, I doubt not but it was a milder
sort of imprisonment, for we shall hereafter see that the Prophet prayed that he
might not be thence thrown into the dark prison where he had been. He sought it
as no common favor to remain in some prison; and he was as yet exposed to the
mockeries of all. However this may have been, we see that the people had then
become nothing better, though they had already been chastised and scourged by
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We ought at the same timeto bear in mind what I have
already said, that though the ungodly sought in all ways wholly to extinguish
the word of God, they yet did not attain what they wished; for God broke through
all hinderances, and continued the course of his word notwithstanding all their
attempts. And this ought to be carefully noticed, for we see at this day all
sorts of contrivances made by the wicked to impede the course of celestial
truth. Let then this history be remembered, that though Jeremiah was a captive,
yet his word was free and his tongue at liberty, as Paul also boasts, that
though he was bound with chains, yet God&#8217;s word was not bound.

<div><font face="Palatino">Then the reason is added why he was shut up in
prison, &#8212; he had dared to prophesy against the city and the king himself.
It was no wonder that the king&#8217;s mind was exasperated when Jeremiah boldly
said that he would come into the hands of his enemies, for he had not only
spoken of the ruin of the city, but also of the fall of the king; he had said
that he would be brought before king Nebuchadnezar, and be led to Babylon, and
be there until God visited him. We know how delicate are the ears of kings; it
was then no wonder Zedekiah became incensed against Jeremiah; but yet he ought
to have been softened and humbled when he found that this oracle had come from
God. That he then still kept Jeremiah a prisoner, proves his madness and
stupidity, for he had no regard for God. I shall proceed with the subject
to-morrow.</font><br></div>

HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SIXTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We began yesterday to speak of the presumption, and
also of the madness of King Zedekiah in keeping the Prophet in prison, while he
was yet besieged by his enemies, as it had been foretold. He saw that Jeremiah
had spoken as from the mouth of God, for the accomplishment of the prophecy
proved that he had brought forward nothing rashly, but what had been committed
to him from above; and yet he did not throw aside his own perverseness. The
words themselves shew sufficiently that he was wholly blinded, for he said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore dost thou prophesy to
us, The Chaldeans will come and take this city?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">It was not indeed the design of this foolish
and insane king to close the mouth of the Prophet, and, at the same time, to
confess that he had a command from God; but thus it is commonly with the wicked,
they assail as it were blindly the servants of God, without any judgment or
discrimination. Were any one to ask them, whether they mean openly and
professedly to resist God as their judge, they would deny it; but yet they
cannot bear to be warned and reproved. Here then, as in a mirror, we see how
madly all the wicked resist God, and try as much as they can to extinguish his
Spirit. In short, they may, indeed, concede some authority to God, provided they
be allowed to live without having anything said against their lusts by his
prophets. There is yet no doubt but that the king was especially exasperated by
the following words of the Prophet, &#8212; </font><br></div>

exempt from the common judgment, he was especially displeased with Jeremiah; for
kings seek to be exempt from all laws, and when they allow the people to be
reproved, they yet wish themselves to be deemed sacred. As then Jeremiah classed
the king Zedekiah with all the common people, it was a thing not to be endured
by a proud king. Hence his indignation was such, that he shut up Jeremiah in
prison; and he became<i> </i>implacable, even when God&#8217;s hand pressed hard

Nebuchadnezar Zedekiah captive; and </i></font><font face="Palatino">he will
remain in exile until I shall <i>visit him. </i>Some understand this time of
visiting of his death, for it is certain that he died in Babylon; and as his
condition was not improved like that of Jeconiah who was taken from the filth of
a prison to the table of the king, this exposition at the first view seems
probable, that is, that he was worn down to death by poverty and disgrace. It,
however, seems that some alleviation was promised, if indeed a certain kind of
death may be deemed a favor; for he was not slain with the sword; and though he
was not restored to his own country, there is yet nothing improper in this way
of speaking, that he would be in exile until he was visited, for nothing
particular could be hence concluded; and we shall hereafter see that when dead
he was buried honorably and with mourning. It is then no wonder that God points
out here a time of favor, though Zedekiah was never restored to his own Country,
and we know that his eyes were plucked out by King Nebuchadnezar, after having
been tried and condemned. But this favor of God, however, is not here without
reason mentioned, for Nebuchadnezar at length treated him more kindly, at least
as far as his burial was concerned:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lead

he shall be then as one of the lowest, and shall, in short, drag on life
ignominiously until the time of my visitation.</font><br></div>

the Prophet meets those foolish notions which still filled the minds of the
Jews, so that they did not submit to God nor humble themselves<i> </i>under his
mighty hand; for there was yet a large number of men, and the city had strong
fortifications. As then they saw that they were furnished with men and forces,
they were still confident; and then they became<i> </i>hardened on account of
the length of the time they had sustained the siege. When enemies make<i>
</i>the first attack, fear fills the minds of all; but when the event
disappoints them, then they who before trembled gather courage. So it was with
the Jews; for when the city was first encompassed by the Chaldean army, the
miserable inhabitants no doubt were greatly terrified; but when they saw their
enemies stopped, and effecting nothing by their attacks, they then hardened
their hearts more and more. For we must notice what I said yesterday, that they
had been besieged probably six or eight months when this vision was given to
Jeremiah. Hence<i> </i>it was that their confidence was greater. But the Prophet
repels this folly by saying,</font><br></div>

but the issue will be unsuccessful; for God will lay you prostrate before your

<div><font face="Palatino">The sum of this introduction is, that Jeremiah was
then shut up in prison, and that the king continued in his contumacy, though
God&#8217;s hand pressed hard on him; and then the cause of this is set forth,
even because he boldly threatened the king and the city, and deelard that
God&#8217;s vengeance was nigh them, so that the king would be led into exile
and the city taken and plundered by their enemies. It now follows, &#8212;

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The whole of this passage ought to be read together,
for the Prophet at large explains how and by what symbol this prophecy had been
confirmed. Now the purpose of the whole is to shew that after a long time the
Jews would return to their own country, for God would restore them, and their
captivity would have an end. God&#8217;s design, then, was to give them a hope
of deliverance, but yet they were admonished to wait patiently for the end of
their exile.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now come to the external symbol. The Prophet
was commanded to buy a field of his uncle&#8217;s son. Now this appeared
strange, for the enemies had taken possession of that part of the country, and
none of the Jews could then venture to go out to their own fields. As then they
were deprived of the very sight of their own fields, the Prophet must have
appeared to have been beside himself when he bought a field in the possession of
enemies. But in this way God intended to shew, that after the Jews had for a
time been deprived of the possession of the land, they would again return to it,
so that every one would recover his own right, and thus everything would become
completely their own, that is, after God had shewed them mercy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But in the first place, let us see whether this was,
as they say, a naked vision, or a real transaction. Some think that it was
exhibited to Jeremiah by the prophetic Spirit; but it may be easily gathered
from the context that the field was actually bought. It is first said, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>word came to
Jeremiah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but shortly after it is added,
that after his uncle&#8217;s son came, Jeremiah was informed that the whole
business was directed by God. God then foretold the Prophet what was to be,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, Hanameel the son of
Shallum, thine uncle, shall come to thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and shall offer to sell his field to thee. This is what God said to the
Prophet; and thus far we may say, that Jeremiah was informed of what was to be
either by a dream or a vision; but when he afterwards adds, that Hanameel
himself came, and that Jeremiah testifies that he now knew that it was from the
Lord, there is no doubt but that it is a real narrative. God then
inducedHanameel to come to Jeremiah and to offer him the field on sale, and to
ask him to buy it, because he was the next heir, and therefore had the right of
redemption. We then perceive that it was a communication from above, but then
the reality was connected with it, for Hanameel came and sold the field before
witnesses; and all this was necessary, not so much on account of Jeremiah as of
the whole people, and especially of the faithful, for whom this prophecy was
particularly designed; for God did not intend this to be a common treasure, but
laid it up for his chosen people, as we may gather from the
conclusion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Before Hanameel then came, the Prophet was instructed
that nothing was done unadvisedly, but that God had arranged and ordered the
whole. He was then commanded to buy the field, and as it were to cast away his
money; for who would not have said that it was the same thing as to throw it
away? And then we are to notice a circumstance as to the time; for the Prophet
was then in danger of his life, to what purpose then was the field to him? We
have also said that he could not have a free access to it, had he not been shut
up in prison; for he could not have ventured to go out of the city. It was then
a most strange and ridiculous purchase according to the judgment of the flesh;
for Jeremiah squandered away his money, and the possession of the field was only
imaginary. But yet as God would have him to buy it, he spared not his money, but
purchased the field from his uncle&#8217;s son.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hanameel his uncle&#8217;s son
came</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as Jehovah had spoken, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>came into the court of the
prison</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and that he spoke to him as God
had foretold. As to the end of the verse, it may seem strange that the Prophet
says, that he now <i>knew </i>that the word came from God: for if he before
doubted, where would be the certainty as to the prophetic spirit? He had already
received a vision; he ought to have embraced what he knew had been foretold to
him from above, even without any hesitation: but it appears that he was in
suspense and perplexity. It then seems an evidence of unbelief, that he did not
put a full and all entire trust in God&#8217;s testimony, and was not fully
persuaded as to the heavenly oracle, until he saw the whole thing really
accomplished. But it is right to distinguish between the knowledge received from
the revelation of the Spirit and experimental knowledge, as they say. The
Prophet therefore did not then for the first time learn that God had spoken, but
as he was confirmed in the certainty of his faith, and in the thing itself,
there is no inconsistency; for nothing is taken away from the credit and
authority of God&#8217;s word, when the reality and experience confirm us; and
thus God often has a regard to the weakness of his people. Jeremiah then relied
on God&#8217;s oracle, and was fully persuaded that he was directed from above
to buy the field; but afterwards, when Hanameel came to him, the event was as it
were the sealing of the vision: then the truth of God was more and more
confirmed in the heart of the Prophet. This, as I have said, was experimental
knowledge, which detracts nothing from the credibility of the word, but is
rather a help and a comfort to human infirmity. In this sense it was that he
said, that he now <i>knew </i>it; and thus he intended also to make others to
believe the prophecy. For when the faithful compare a vision with its
accomplishment, this consent and harmony, so to speak, avails not a little to
confirm their faith, that as when in one part they hear that God had spoken, and
when in another they see that what the Prophet had been taught was really
fulfilled.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF60</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bought the field of Hanameel his
uncle&#8217;s son, which was in Anathoth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>in </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the land of
Benjamin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There is nothing superfluous
in these words, for though the Prophet speaks of places well known, yet he had a
regard to the time of the purchase, for the land of Benjamin was then in the
power of enemies: the Jews had been reduced to such straits that they were not
safe at Jerusalem. Anathoth was a village, as it was well known, exposed to the
ravages of enemies, and was seized on as a prey at their first coming. And he
adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the land of
Benjamin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>for it was nigh the borders of
Judah, but it had been forsaken by its inhabitants, and all had fled to
Jerusalem. As then the land of Benjamin had no inhabitant, it was by no means
reasonable for the Prophet to pay even the smallest sum for a field
there.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may now be asked, how could Hanameel, who was of
the Levitical order, sell a field, for we know that fields did not belong to the
Levites, and that they had tithes for their inheritance.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;041821&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
18:21) But this is to be taken for a suburban field, for they had the suburbs,
and each had a meadow: they neither ploughed nor reaped, nor was it indeed
lawful for them, according to the law, to labor in agriculture, but they fed
cattle and sheep: and this is proved by the smallness of the sum given; for what
was the field sold for? for seven shekels and ten pieces of
silver.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF61</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
We hence see that it was not a large field, but only a meadow like a garden; for
the price would have been larger, had it been some acres of land. Then the
difficulty here is easily removed, for Hanameel sold to Jeremiah a small meadow,
as every Levite had in the suburbs a meadow to feed his sheep or his cattle; at
the same time none of them had large herds, but each had a cow or two. This,
then, is what we are to understand by the field.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet adds, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wrote a
book</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, the writing of the
purchase; for

purchase was made, and then it was <i>sealed, </i>not as we do by appending a
seal to it, but it was closed up, as the custom then was. He also adds,
according to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the law and
custom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and at last he says that another
writing was made which remained
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>open</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>and it is thought that. the open writing means what we call <i>a copy;
</i>and so the sealed writing was deposited in a chest, and the open copy could
be referred to at any time.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF62</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Though the Prophet alludes to a common
custom, yet I doubt not but that he wrote this prophecy on rolls, one sealed and
the other open, in order that those who were then living might receive some
benefit from his doctrine, and also that the authentic copy, or the original
itself, might remain for posterity, as we shall hereafter see. And doubtless God
not only intended to strengthen the hope of the faithful after the completed
time of exile, as this prophecy would he dormant for seventy years; but he
designed also that it should be then of use, so as to be a support to them in
their sufferings. There was also another benefit to be derived from this
prophecy, even that the Jews while in exile might begin to entertain hope, and
remembering this vision, might feel assured that God would be their Deliverer,
according to what he had promised.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This then was the reason why two writings of the
purchase were made, the sealed and the open.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF63</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The open had a present benefit, as it
would make the faithful to go more willingly into exile, and calmly to submit to
the chastisement allotted to them by God; and for this reason the Prophecy was
to be open to all. It was also sealed, in order that after the lapse of seventy
years it might animate the godly, and inspire them with the hope of their
promised deliverance. This, therefore, is the reason, as I think, why the
Prophet relates that he made a writing and sealed it, and then that he made
another writing which remained open.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds, that he gave both to his scribe
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Baruch, the son of Neriah, the
son of Maaseiah, in the presence of Hanameel, and in the presence of the
witnesses who had subscribed the writings, and in the presence of all who stood
there</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, in the court of the
prison. Hence we may again plainly conclude, that he is narrating a real
history, and not a vision exhibited to him: the seller, Hanameel, was present
together with witnesses and other Jews; and he says that he gave up the writing
with certain orders, for otherwise it would have been merely the delivering up
of a book. If he had only deposited it with Baruch, the people would have learnt
nothing; but the orders are added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I charged
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Baruch,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>saying</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>etc. We hence may also conclude, that this oracle was given to the Prophet,
not only that it might continue for posterity, even after the time of exile was
completed, but that it might also be then published and made known to all the
Jews. He then says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He had not yet shewn the design
of the prophecy; but when he said that the affair was carried on by the command
of God, he rendered them all attentive.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>these writings, and
put them </i></font><font face="Palatino">in an
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>earthen
</i></font><font face="Palatino">or a potter&#8217;s
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>vessel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>It seems strange that he did not bid him to put them in another kind of
vessel, for that vessel might become decayed, and so the writings might have
perished. But we know that even the most precious treasures are deposited in
earthen vessels. It is then no wonder that God commanded the prophecy to be put
in an earthen vessel. Were any one disposed to understand something more
refined, it might be said, that the promise, which apparently was not very firm,
was an earthen vessel; for what is more frail than a voice which is dissipated
into air? The Jews were driven into exile; they had heard from the mouth of
Jeremiah, that the prefixed period was seventy years: but they might, in the
meantime have despaired, since only the sound of the voice had reached their
ears. However this may be, since the oracle, which was a pledge of deliverance,
had been laid up in an earthen vessel, it remained safe and undecayed, because
the treasure had been deposited there by God&#8217;s command.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they may continue for many
days</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By these words he intimates that
the prophecy would not only be profitable to the Jews, who were to be driven
soon after into captivity, but also to their posterity, who were not yet born,
and that they might know that this prophecy would stand valid after their death,
for we ought not to measure the faithfulness of God by the extent of our life.
This, then, was the reason why this clause was added: the prophecy was to be
preserved in earthen vessels, that it might remain safe and secure for many
days, that is, until God delivered his people.</font><br></div>

at this day the evidence of eternal salvation sealed in earthen vessels, and

<div><font face="Palatino">Though we sufficiently perceive the meaning of the
preceding prophecy, it may, however, be proper to touch briefly on the last
part, which is the application of the vision,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Houses, and fields, and vineyards

</i>God&#8217;s design then was, that his servant should lay out his money
without any regard to his own interest, in order that he might, by this expense,
cherish the hope of the faithful to the time of restoration. What is here said
was deemed incredible, for no one thought that such a change would happen, as
that a permission would be given to the Jews to return to their own country; for
the power of the Chaldean monarchy was deemed invincible, and it was necessary
for it to be wholly overthrown, in order that God&#8217;s people might be set
free. For this reason then the vision was given, even that the Jews might know
that their calamity would not be perpetual, for God had resolved to restore the
people and the land. But by the word <i>field, </i>all possessions were
designated, for he names not only fields, but also <i>houses </i>and
<i>vineyards. </i>It now follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Though the Prophet was discharging his own office,
yet he confesses that he was himself perplexed at the vision. It hence appears
that God&#8217;s counsel was not always made known in everything to the
Prophets, but as far as it was expedient. However, the Prophets were not seized
with ecstasies like heathen soothsayers, who pretended they were carried away
beyond all their senses. There was not then this fanaticism in the Prophets, so
that they spoke like sounding brass, or like the ass of Balaam; but the Lord
discovered to them what they taught. They were then disciples, so that they
delivered faithfully to the people, as if it were from hand to hand, what was
committed to them. But the knowledge with which they were endued was not
inconsistent with ignorance as to some things; as when the Prophet said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Houses, and fields, and vineyards
shall yet be bought</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he knew that God
promised the restitution of the land and of the people, nor was the vision
itself an obscure enigma; but yet the reason was hid from him, and hence the
perplexity of which he now speaks; for being astonished at so wonderful a thing,
he had recourse to prayer, and confessed that his mind was perplexed. The wonder
then of the Prophet proceeded from his ignorance; but that ignorance was not
incompatible with prophetic knowledge. For as far as it was necessary, and the
office of a teacher required, he no doubt understood the counsel of God; but
such was the height or the depth of this mystery, that he was constrained to
confess that it was a work of God which surpassed all his
thoughts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive how these two things are
consistent, &#8212; the prophetic knowledge with which Jeremiah was endued, and
the ignorance<i> </i>which compelled him to make this exclamation. He knew with
certainty what had been shewn to him in the vision, but what was the design and
how the work could be done by God, seemed incomprehensible, and hence his
astonishment. He therefore says that he prayed: and by this we are taught, that
whenever thoughts creep into our minds, which toss us here and there, we ought
to flee to prayer. For many increase their anxieties by fomenting them, while
they turn themselves to all quarters, and indulge their own thoughts, and weary
themselves without any benefit. Whenever, therefore, any anxiety stealthily lays
hold on our minds, let us know that the remedy ought to be in due time applied,
that is, to pray to God; so that he may relieve us, and not suffer us to sink
into the deep, as it usually happens to all who are curious, and give loose
reins to their own imaginations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see that the Prophet was greatly astonished,
and yet in such a way as not to look for more than what was profitable; but he
immediately prayed, that God would make him to understand what grieved his mind.
His prayer follows, which, however, does not immediately discover the mind of
the Prophet, for he does not shew the purpose of his prayer until he comes to
the 25th verse
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;243225&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
32:25). But he seems here to refer to many things unconnected with his subject.
His design must be ascertained from the conclusion of his prayer, &#8220;O<i>
</i>Lord,&#8221; he says, &#8220;why hast thou bidden me to buy the field which
is now in the hand of enemies? the Chaldeans possess it; and thou hast bidden me
to throw away my money.&#8221; This was substantially his
prayer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But Jeremiah seems to wander and take long circuits
when he says, &#8220;Thou<i> </i>hast made the heavens and the earth by thy
great power and stretched-out arm; nothing is wonderful to thee; thou shewest
mercy to thousand generations; thou repayest the iniquity of fathers to their
children; thy name is Jehovah of hosts; thou art great in council and excellent
in work; thine eyes are open,&#8221; etc. These things seem not to belong in any
degree to the present subject. But the Prophet&#8217;s object, no doubt, was to
restrain himself, as it were, by putting on a bridle, so that he might acquiesce
in the counsel of God, though it was hid and incomprehensible to him: for if he
had immediately rushed into prayer, he might, at the first burst of his
feelings, have contended with God; for such is the disposition and character of
man, when he suddenly addresses God, that he boils over beyond all moderation.
The Prophet then, who well understood that there is no such moderation in men as
to judge rightly and calmly of God&#8217;s works, set up against himself these
fences, and placed, as it were, barriers around him, that he might not take more
liberty than what was right. Let. us then know that these high terms in which
the Prophet spoke were designed for this end, &#8212; that he might produce
moderation and humility in himself, so that he might check all those roving
thoughts by which men are wont to divert themselves. Let us come now to the
words:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ah, Lord Jehovah!
</i></font><font face="Palatino">he says;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>behold, thou hast made heaven and
earth. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Were any one not to attend to the
circumstances<i> </i>of the passage, he might think that the Prophet is here
rambling, and does not connect his sentences, so that his prayer seems
incoherent. But as I have already said, that as the Prophet knew<i> </i>that men
take too much liberty when they speak of God&#8217;s works, he bridled himself
in due time, before he came to his subject. He then made this sort of
introduction, &#8220;O<i> </i>Lord, it does not behove me to contend with thee,
nor is it right in me to require thee to give me a reason for thy doings, for
thou hast </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>made heaven and earth
by thy great power and extended arm</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.&#8221;
</i>There is here then an implied contrast between God and mortal man;
&#8220;For who am I to dare to summon thee to a contest! for thy power is justly
to be dreaded by us; when we raise up our eyes to heaven, when we look on the
earth, there is nothing which ought not to fill us with admiration of thy power,
for its immensity appears above and below.&#8221; We hence see that the Prophet
extols in high terms the power of God, in order that he might keep himself in a
meek and humble state of mind, and not dare to clamor against God, nor
presumptuously rush forward to pronounce a judgment on his works.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says; he sets before his eyes the wonderful workmanship of the world, in
which the immeasurable power of God shines forth most
conspicuously.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nor is there any thing hid from
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This clause admits of two
meanings; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">alp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>pala, </i>means wonderful, and also hidden. Now the greater part of
interpreters give this explanation, &#8212; that nothing is hid from God,
because all things are before his eyes, for his knowledge penetrates to the
deepest depths. It may then be a commendation of God&#8217;s knowledge, as an
eulogy on his power has previously been given; and this meaning is not
unsuitable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I do not, however, reject the other meaning, given by
<i>Jerome, </i>that there is nothing difficult to God, or wonderful, because all
things are subject to his will. Thus the Prophet might say, continuing the same
thought, that the power of God, which shines forth to our view in the heavens
and in the earth, may at the same time be observed in the permanent government
of the world; for he who has created the heavens and the earth can do all
things, so that nothing is wonderful to him, that is, nothing is difficult for
his power as soon as he has decreed this or that. The main object of the Prophet
is, however, still the same.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF64</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shewest mercy to thousands,
and repayest the iniquity of the fathers to the bosom of their
children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here the Prophet acknowledges
God&#8217;s judgments to be right, though the reason for them escapes human
minds. Both these things were necessary, that is, that Jeremiah should set
before himself the awful power of God, and that he should also regard
God&#8217;s judgments as right, though men often think otherwise. For God has
hidden reasons for his judgments; and so it happens, that various thoughts
disturb us, and every one is disposed to set himself up against God. Hence the
Prophet, after having spoken of the immeasurable power of God, now declares also
that he is a just judge of the world; and he again restrains himself by another
bridle, lest he should pronounce a judgment on God&#8217;s works according to
his own perceptions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shewest mercy to
thousands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is taken from the Law of
Moses,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;022006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
20:6) for the Prophets often borrowed their chief sentences from Moses, of whom
they were the interpreters. Since God then under the Law declared that he is
merciful to thousand generations, though it appears unnaccountable to us, yet
nothing remains for us to do, but to learn reverently to receive what we cannot
comprehend. The Prophet then here confesses that the method which God adopts as
to his mercy is hid from the human mind. But the latter clause seems, however,
less reasonable, &#8212; that God should
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>repay the iniquity of fathers to
their children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Shortly before we saw
that this was set forth as an impious blasphemy,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;243129&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
31:29) when they said that their fathers had eaten sour grapes, and that their
children&#8217;s teeth were set on edge; for it is always true that the soul
that sinneth, it shall die.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;261802&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
18:2, 20; Deuteronomy 24:16) But if God repays the iniquity of fathers to their
children, he punishes the innocent, and transfers to children what he ought to
have rendered to their fathers. But the Prophet, regarding it a wicked thing to
contradict what God had spoken by Moses, adores here this mystery, and thus
brings himself to humility and meekness, so that he might not break forth into
extremes when speaking of the hidden works of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must at the same time briefly observe, that the
innocent are not punished when God includes children with their fathers, and
casts the iniquity of fathers into the bosom of their children, for he does not
refer to the innocent and the righteous, but to the wicked. Some, when they saw
that this truth militated against the common feelings of mankind, have laid hold
of an evasion, that is, that God by a temporal punishment renders to children
what their fathers had deserved. But God speaks without exception, that he
repays to the bosom of children the reward due to their fathers. But how ought
this to be understood? It is a part of this punishment, that God withholds from
them his Spirit. When, therefore, his purpose is to punish the vices of fathers
in their posterity, he withholds from their posterity the light and grace of his
Spirit. It cannot then be but that they will ever accumulate evils on evils, and
thus they are entangled in the guilt of their fathers. God then proceeds by
degrees in the work of punishing sins; for when it is his purpose to forgive the
son the punishment which he together with his father has deserved, he draws him
to himself by his Spirit, so that he is freed from punishment; but if his
purpose is to execute vengeance on sons and grandsons, he withholds from them,
as I have already said, the gift of the Spirit, so that they do nothing but
provoke his wrath more and more, and thus they become involved in the same guilt
with their fathers; hence fathers and children receive in common the same
punishment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This indeed seems not at the first view to be just
and right; but let us remember that God&#8217;s judgments are hid from us, and
for this reason, &#8212; that we may cultivate meekness and humility and learn
to be soberly wise, and so confess God to be a just judge as to know that our
minds cannot penetrate into this deep abyss. But still the solution given seems
plain enough, that is, that God never punishes the innocent. For when he visits
the sins of fathers on their children, a part of that punishment is, as I have
already stated, that he withholds from the children the light of his Spirit;
being blind, they ever run headlong to their own ruin, and thus by the continual
commission of new sins they provoke God&#8217;s vengeance against themselves.
When therefore God renders to them the reward due to their fathers, he punishes
them at the same time for what they themselves have deserved; nor have they any
reason to complain, because they have been guilty in common with their fathers:
there is, therefore, nothing strange that they share with them in their
punishment. But it, however, depends on the hidden mercy of God, that. he favors
some with pardon, and thus delivers them from ruin, while he forsakes others;
and as they are wicked, they deserve all the punishment he inflicts on them:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>repayest into the bosom
of their sons after them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, after
their death.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards exclaims,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God, strong and mighty! Jehovah
of hosts is his name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He again declares
the greatness of God&#8217;s power, that he might restrain himself, and not
rashly undertake any new inquiry, as the ease is with curious men, who indulge
themselves in speculations, and thus summon God as it were to an account, as
though there could be appointed a tribunal before which he might be found
guilty. As then the insolence and arrogance of human nature are so great, the
Prophet here sets barriers around himself, so that he might keep within the
bounds of humility and soberness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards changes the person, which is a proof of
vehemence and ardor; for it is, as we have seen, a prayer. He does not now
address God directly, but says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah of hosts is his
name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>speaking in the third
person.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF65</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Had he continued in the same strain, he would have said, &#8220;Thou art God,
strong and mighty,&#8221; etc., but he says, &#8220;Jehovah of hosts is his
name.&#8221; We then see that the Prophet as it were turns aside; and this
change of person, as I have stated, proceeded from the vehemence and ardor of
his mind. And it often happens to the faithful, that they break off their direct
address when they pray, while they contemplate God&#8217;s works, as displaying,
now his power, then his goodness, or his wisdom. The faithful then do not always
pray in a continued strain; but as feeling guides them, they now address God,
then they turn aside and blend apostrophes. It follows, &#8212;

And then he mentions the execution of his counsel, which affords evidences of
that wisdom which appears to us. By the works of God we learn how great and how
unequalled is his wisdom: for that in itself cannot be comprehended, nay, men
could not have the least knowledge of it, except it were rendered conspicuous by
works. The works of God then through their excellency are evidences of his
immeasurable wisdom. For this reason and in this sense the Prophet calls God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>great in counsel and great in
work</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds, that his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>eyes are open on all the ways of
men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By these words he intimates that he
is the judge of the whole world, and that whatever men may consult, speak, or
do, must come to a reckoning. The meaning is, that the providence of God so
extends to all parts of the world, that the works of men cannot possibly be hid
from him, and that no one can escape his hand; for after having spoken of
God&#8217;s eyes, he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that
he may render to every one according to his ways and according to the fruit of
his doings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet then does not speak here of any idle
speculation such as ungodly men entertain; for they confess that all things are
seen by God, but imagine that he is satisfied with having only this bare
knowledge; and thus they deprive him of the dignity and office of a judge. But
the Prophet here shews what the end of God&#8217;s providence is, why God has
his eyes open, even that he may at last produce at his tribunal all the sayings
and doings of men, yea, their thoughts also. We are further taught by these
words that our life cannot be rightly formed, unless we bear in mind the
presence of God, so as to know that his eyes are on us, and that there is
nothing hid from him: for whence is there so much liberty in sinning, except
that men grow wanton like fugitives? as when a rebellious son withdraws himself
from the eyes of his father, he can then abandon himself wholly to sin, for he
is freed from all fear and shame. So our thoughtlessness is like a flight, for
we think that we are far removed from God. This then, as I have said, ought
always to be remembered, that the eyes of God are open on all our ways, and for
this end, &#8212; that he may render to every one according to his ways, and
that every<i> </i>one may gather the fruit of his own doings.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though, then, God for a time may connive at what we
do, and may not manifestly shew that he is the judge of men, there is no reason
that indifference should creep over us, as though we could escape from his hand;
but let us know that all our doings and sayings are now noticed by him, that he
may hereafter shew that he is not an idle observer, as some ungodly men dream,
but that he is an eye-witness of all things, that he may at last appear as our
judge.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage is turned by Papists for the support of
merits by works; but<i> </i>it is a frivolous attempt; for when Scripture
declares that it shall be rendered to every one according to his works, it does
not exclude the gratuitous mercy of God; and when God renders a reward to the
faithful, it depends on gratuitous pardon, because he forgives them whatever
would otherwise vitiate their good works: and to speak more exactly, God does
not render to the faithful according to their works, except as he gratuitously
pardons them and forgives whatever they have done amiss. Reward then depends on
the free mercy of God only. As to the wicked, it is no wonder that a just reward
is said to be rendered to them;for we know that they are worthy of eternal
perdition, and that God is a righteous judge when he punishes their sins. It

Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that: is, for the sake of his
people. For why were so many miracles done, except to prove the care he had for
his chosen people, and thus to confirm his covenant? We hence see that
God&#8217;s favor towards the children of Abraham is here set forth, that is,
when he refers to the signs and wonders</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">which had been done in the land of Egypt. And he
adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and in

a certain time, but he performed them that they might be remembered in all ages,

<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and among
men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Prophet goes on still further.
After he had spoken of the redemption of the people, he intimates that wherever
he turned himself, he observed and admired the evidences of God&#8217;s power,
as though he had said, &#8220;O Lord, thou hast indeed given peculiar
testimonies as to thy wonderful power and goodness; the redemption of thy people
was a singular work, and ought to be commemorated through all ages; but wherever
we turn ourselves, there is no corner in the whole world where some miracles do
not appear, which ought to lead us to celebrate thy praises.&#8221; We hence see
that the Prophet proceeds from what is particular to what is general: after
having considered God&#8217;s power and goodness in the redemption of his
people, he extended his thoughts to all parts of the world, and contemplated
God&#8217;s miracles everywhere. And this is what often occurs in Scripture;
after having been reminded of some particular instance of divine power or grace,
we are carried away so that we make a transition to what is general. And he
adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and thou hast made
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or acquired to thyself,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a name according to this
day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, thou hast made thy name to
be perpetual, as its glory still at this day shines forth before our eyes. Then
the Prophet means that God had so wonderfully manifested his power, that the
knowledge of it would be perpetual, and could never be buried by the ingratitude
of men.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah comes now nearer to the point in hand; for,
after having spoken of the unequalled power of God, he now extols his righteous
judgment in inflicting punishment on an ungodly and wicked people. For this end
he refers to the favor of redemption, and he then adds that the <i>land </i>had
been given to Israel which had been promised to their fathers. He afterwards
states that this favor had been conferred on the ungrateful, for they
immediately shook off the yoke and despised God their redeemer, together with
his Law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says, that the people had been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>brought up from the land of Egypt
with signs and wonders</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is an
amplification, for God had in an unusual manner made it sufficiently evident
that without his favor the people could not have been delivered from Egypt. For
had it not been for the manifest display of God&#8217;s power in miracles and
wonders, the Israelites might have appropriated to themselves the favor of God,
or to some worldly instrumentality; but God&#8217;s favor appeared so
resplendent in signs and wonders, that the liberation of the people could not
have been ascribed either to fortune, or to the efforts of men, or to any other
means. And for the same purpose he mentions
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the strong hand and the extended
arm</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He intimates by these words, that
the people had been so delivered, that the hand of God, yea, his extended arm,
openly appeared, that is, his power, as we have explained elsewhere, was
manifested far and wide.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He refers at last to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>great
terror</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>such was the haughtiness of
their enemies, that they would have never suffered the people to depart, had
they not been filled with great terror. As then the Egyptians had been by terror
subdued, Jeremiah amplifies by this circumstance the favor of redemption, as
though he had said, that God&#8217;s favor was not obscure, because the
Israelites might have known by these extraordinary evidences that they were
delivered by a divine power. For so great was the power, the valor, and cruelty
of their enemies, that no hope of a free departure could have been entertained,
had not God put forth his hand from heaven. It afterwards follows, &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the fruitfulness of the land is commended, so
that the ingratitude of the people for their redemption might appear less
excusable. God had already bound them, as it were, more than enough to himself,
but when the wealth and fruitfulness of the land were added, the bounty of God
was doubled, which, by a stronger and more sacred chain, bound the people to
obedience. But when they buried, as it were, both their benefits, their impiety
was extreme, and so much baser was their ingratitude. We hence see why the
Prophet said that the <i>land </i>was given to the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He at the same time mentions the reason, even because
it had been promised to their fathers. It is not, however, right to suppose that
the fathers had any merits, as Jerome says, who ignorantly perverts this
passage; for he says, that nothing was due to the people on the ground of merit;
but that the fathers were yet worthy on account of their great virtues. But we
know that God&#8217;s covenant was from the beginning gratuitous. The Prophet
then means here, that the land was not given as a reward rendered to the people
for their works, but that it was given them because it had been gratuitously
promised. And he mentions the <i>oath, </i>because God, regarding the infirmity
of Abraham and the fathers, confirmed by an oath his own promise. But as I have
spoken elsewhere more at large on this subject, I touch on it but slightly now.
However, whenever there is mention made of an oath, let us know that reproof is
indirectly given to the inconstancy of men, who always vacillate, and can never
recumb on God&#8217;s<i> </i>promise, except they are helped by this
confirmation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">However this may be, the Prophet here reminds us that
God confirmed the pledge which he had given to the fathers when the people
entered into the land, because they could not have obtained it by their valor,
or by any other means. In short, Jeremiah calls the attention of the people to
God&#8217;s gratuitous covenant, that they might understand that they became
possessors of the land by no other right than this, &#8212; that God of his own
free will had promised to Abraham and his seed that he would give them that
land. He speaks, as I have just said, of the fruitfulness of the land, because
it was God&#8217;s design to allure the people in every way, that they might
continue in his service. And when the people, thus bountifully dealt with, did
not acknowledge God&#8217;s favor, their extreme and base stupidity was fully
proved. What the Prophet then means is, that the land was most fruitful, in
which the people had all abundance, and that yet they despised God the giver of
so much bounty, according to what immediately follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet in this verse confesses that. God&#8217;s
vengeance was just, when the people were cast out of the land and driven into
exile, because they, after having entered into the land, did not obey the voice
of God. The very sight of the land ought to have<i> </i>made the people obedient
to God; for they could not have eaten a crumb of bread, without being always
reminded whence their food came, even because God had expelled the Gentiles from
that land. When, therefore, they were filled with all kinds of good things, and
at the same time despised God, no excuse could have been pretended; for if they
made ignorance their pretense, the very land itself was before their eyes,<i>
</i>which recalled them to the fear of God. This, then, is the reason why the
Prophet joins those two things together, that the Israelites
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>entered into the
land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>disobeyed the voice of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, by this clause he intimates that they had not
fallen through ignorance, because God had sufficiently made known his will. God
had indeed spoken, but it was to the deaf. The Prophet then here shews that
there was no other cause for the sin of the people, but that they obstinately
refused to attend to the voice of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds for the same purpose, that they had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not walked in his
Law</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Law is often compared to a way;
for except God prescribes to us what his will is, and regulates all the actions
of our life according to a certain rule, we should be perpetually going astray.
God&#8217;s Law, then, is justly said to be like a way, according to what Moses
also speaks,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;This is the way,
walk ye in it.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(Deuteronomy

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;233021&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
30:21)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then Jeremiah, after having shewn that the people had
been taught, mentions this, &#8212; that the way had been made known to them, so
that they went astray knowingly and wilfully; for they could not have turned
aside either to the right hand or to the left without being called back by the
doctrine of the Law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, in the third place,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What thou hast commanded them to
do they did not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He explains here the
same thing more clearly and without any figurative expression, even that they
had been unwilling to obey God, while yet they sufficiently understood what was
right; for the Law suffered them not to go astray, and God had included in it
everything necessary to be known. The Prophet then shews that they had not
turned aside except through perverseness, because they knew what God required.
As a certain Lacedaemonian said, that the Athenians knew what was right, but
were unwilling to do it; so the Prophet in this place distinguishes the open
impiety and contempt of the people from ignorance and inadvertence, and does not
mean that the people did not satisfy <i>all </i>the precepts of the
Law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this passage also <i>Jerome </i>explains very
absurdly; for he says that the Israelites did not stand to their promises,
because they had said that they would do whatever God commanded. But the Prophet
here does not condemn them as to one thing only, as though he had said that
there had been some defect, but he says that they had been wholly disobedient,
for they had not despised only one precept of the Law, but had as it were
designedly cast aside the whole Law, and obeyed none of God&#8217;s
commandments. Then this negative sets forth the defection<i> </i>of the people
as to the whole law, and as to every<i> </i>precept of it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this passage is worthy of special notice, because
the Prophet advisedly repeats the same thing, &#8212; that the people
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had not walked in the
Law</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, &#8212; </i>that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had not obeyed the voice of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, &#8212;

what had been
commanded</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF67</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for a heavier condemnation and
vengeance await those who have been faithfully taught what pleases God and what
is right, and yet follow their own will, and are carried away by the passions
and lusts of the flesh. In a word, Jeremiah points out the highest pitch of
impiety, that is, when people clearly and familiarly know what the will of God
is, and yet disregard it and shake off the yoke, and thus shew manifestly a
contempt for the whole Law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore thou hast made to come
on them all this evil</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Prophet here
testifies that whatever had happened to the people, was not by chance, but that
a reward was rendered to their sins. Men in some measure acknowledge God&#8217;s
judgments, but this acknowledgment presently vanishes. Wisely then does the
Prophet here shew that God&#8217;s vengeance is evident in adversities, and that
the people thus received the reward which they had deserved. It now follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">Here then at length the Prophet discovers his own
perplexity. We have already stated the reason why he made so long an
introduction before he came to the main thing: it was necessary for him to put
on as it were a bridle; for except we restrain our thoughts, we shall become<i>

was bidden to buy the field when the city and the whole country were delivered
up into their enemies. He then mentions here this inconsistency, and
confesses<i> </i>that his mind was embarrassed, for he could not discover why
God had bidden him to buy the field, and yet had determined to drive the people
into exile and to scatter them into remote lands. But we have said that the
Prophet was fully persuaded of God&#8217;s truth; and hence it was that he was
so willing and ready to obey; for he made no delay in buying the field; and he
afterwards laid up with Baruch the writings of the purchase. But after having
performed all this, he brought a complaint against God; and as the thing
appeared unreasonable, he desired this knot to be untied.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold the
mounts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, the warlike engines, for the
word may mean either. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twlls</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
sallut, </i>often means mounts; but as mention is made here of a siege, the
Prophet seems to refer, as we have said in the sixth chapter, to warlike engines
or battering rams. And there were engines to beat down walls; great stones or a
number of stones were also cast. I am therefore inclined to the opinion of those
who consider that they were either engines to shoot stones and darts, or
battering rams.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>then, he says, there are moved to the city
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>battering rams to take it, and
the city is delivered up to the Chaldeans</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>It was, it seems, the tenth year of Zedekiah, and at the beginning of the
eleventh month the city was taken. But the Prophet is the best interpreter of
his own words, and what he means may be easily gathered from the context, for he
says that the city was taken by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the sword, by famine, and by
pestilence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as though he had said, that
though the enemies had not as yet entered into the city, yet it was all over
with it, that there was no hope remaining, because it was not only assailed by
arms and a powerful force, but it had also enemies within, which pressed hard on
it, even
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>famine</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pestilence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>As then a great number had already been consumed by pestilence and famine,
the Prophet says, that though, the enemies should cease to assail it, and make
no forcible entrance into it, yet it was all over with it, because the
pestilence and famine had so prevailed, that there was no hope of deliverance.
By these words he intimates an extremity of despair; and hence also arose the
thought which tormented the mind of the Prophet, that it appeared wholly
unreasonable that God should bid him to buy the field when the city had been
already delivered up into the power of enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and what thole hast spoken is
come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>He confirms what he had just said, even that the destruction of the city did
not otherwise happen than through God&#8217;s judgment. And he confirms it,
because whatever then happened, had already been testified during the time of
the Prophet himself. And it hence appeared, that the city was not distressed
through chance, because God had foretold nothing by his servants but what he had
decreed and resolved to do. Then the ruin of Jerusalem was the work of God, of
which he had foretold by his servants. For these two things ought to be joined
together &#8212; the mouth of God and the hand of God. Nor is it lawful to
imagine such a thing as some fanatics do, that God sees from heaven whatever is
done on earth, and yet continues in an idle state. But he decrees what is right,
and then when it is necessary, he testifies it by his servants the Prophets.
However, the mouth of God ought not to be separated from his hand. The Prophet
then shews that the destruction of the city was the righteous judgment of God,
because the Prophets had previously spoken of it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou seest
it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>refer to the preceding sentence, or
to that which immediately follows, even because it seemed inconsistent or
unreasonable that the Prophet should buy the field as God commanded, and yet
that God knew that the land was possessed by enemies, and that the people were
to be driven into exile. Since then God had resolved to cast out the people from
the land, how was it that he had bidden his servant to buy the field? Had all
this been unknown to God, the inconsistency would not have been so evident But
when God perfectly knew that what he had so often proclaimed as to the exile by
his Prophets could not be changed, what could be his purpose in bidding the
field to be bought and the purchase to be confirmed by witnesses, when yet the
city was delivered up to enemies? Jeremiah, after having mentioned the substance
of his prayer, now adds the answer he received from God, in which is seen the
fruit of his prayer, even that he had been taught what had regard to the
deliverance and return of the people, in order that the faithful might entertain
hope, and also that they, relying on the promise, might cheerfully bear their
exile until the prefixed time came. The words are these, &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">We have already said that the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">alp</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>pela, </i>admits of two meanings; it means to be hid and to be wonderful, and
hence by a metaphor it means what is difficult and impossible. Many take it to
mean here, that nothing escapes the observation of God. But as I have said in
the last lecture, I am more inclined to refer it to God&#8217;s power, even that
all things are in the hand and at the pleasure of God, so that there is no
difficulty in his way. For whence comes to men so much anxiety, except that they
are stopped by obstacles? but God can surmount all obstacles without any labor.
That our minds then may not be perplexed, rightly is set before us the power of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this meaning is most suitable to this passage:
for Jeremiah, when that which seemed inconsistent occurred to him, was
constrained to cast his anxiety as it were into the bosom of God. Then God, in
order to relieve him, says that nothing is difficult to him, because he is the
God of all flesh. Though by the words
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the Scripture often means all
kinds of animals, yet oftener the human race only. I do not, however, refinedly
explain this passage, as though God did set the Gentiles in opposition to the
Jews, and thus denied that he would be any longer the God of Abraham&#8217;s
children, because he had repudiated them on account of their sins; but he says
that he is in an especial manner the king of the whole earth, and rules over the
whole human race. As God then, he says, is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the God of all flesh, can
anything be impssible to him?</i></font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The import of the answer is, that though God would
bring to an end the seventy years of exile, yet there was no reason for
hypocrites to gather encouragement, for this promise did not belong to them. God
then speaks here, in the first place, of his vengeance, in order to fill the
despisers of his Law with dread, and to intimate that they were excluded from
the favor of redemption, he afterwards adds, that he would at length be merciful
to the exiles; but this favor is confined to the elect and faithful
alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The two parts of the answer ought then to be noticed,
for God seems here to set in opposition one to another two contrary things. But
as I have said, in the former clause, he has in view the hypocrites, who applied
to themselves, without faith and repentance, what the Prophet had testified of
restoration. God then sets forth here his extreme severity, and then he
mitigates that rigor; but he then turns his discourse to the elect, because they
alone were capable of receiving his favor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now come to the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will deliver this city into the
hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of King Nebuchadnezar, and he will take
it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>this purpose was, that what Jeremiah
himself had predicted by his command, should remain unalterable, that the city
could not be delivered. For it might have disturbed the mind of the Prophet were
the Jews shortly after to be delivered, and were the siege of the city to be
raised: he might, in that case, have been exposed to ridicule, together with his
prophecies, and rashness might have been objected to him, because he had dared
to announce in God&#8217;s name what we before noticed. For this reason and
purpose God declares that nothing could be changed, for the Chaldeans were to
take the city; and thus he bids the Prophet to retain a quiet mind, and not to
disturb himself, as though it was his intention to expose his prophecies to
ridicule; for God&#8217;s sacred name would thus have been subjected to many
reproaches. Had Jeremiah been proved guilty of falsehood, what would have been
the consequence, but that the Jews would have insolently triumphed over God? God
then declares again that the city was given over to
destruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And therefore he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>enter in shall the Chaldeans who
assail the city</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for he does not say
that they would come, but he confirms in other words what he had said;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Break
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>into the

up and fortified; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and shall set
on fire this city</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It was not without
purpose that he mentioned the word city so often; for as it was the sanctuary of
God, and the royal seat, the Jews thought that it was impregnable, and that the
sun could be sooner cast down from heaven than that; enemies could take
possession of it: in order then to subvert this false confidence, God often
mentioned the word city. He at last adds, that the Chaldeans would <i>burn
</i>it, as though he had said, that whatever Jeremiah had predicted would
certainly be fulfilled, not only respecting the attack on the city, but also its
destruction, so that not a stone would be left on a stone, but that there would
be a dreadful desolation until the time of its restoration. The rest
to-morrow.</font><br></div>

HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I did not, in the last lecture, fully explain the
passage in which the Prophet announced the burning of the city. After having
spoken of the city, he mentions the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>houses on
</i></font><font face="Palatino">which they had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>offered incense
</i></font><font face="Palatino">to their idols, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>poured out
libations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He then expresses the cause
why so heavy a vengeance from God awaited that holy city, even because its
houses had been polluted by superstitions. And he says, that incense had been
made to idols on their tops or roofs; for the roofs, as it appears from many
parts of Scripture, were places, as it were, to walk in; and we know that
idolaters ever sought high places, as they imagined that they were thus nearer
to God. Then the design is to shew, that the punishment of which the Prophet had
spoken, was not too severe, because all the houses had been contaminated by many
sacrilegious acts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He first mentions
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Baal</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>foreign
gods</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Baal, we know, is sometimes taken
specifically, and sometimes includes all sorts of idols, and yet the Prophets
often used the plural number, and called them Baalim, that is, patrons; whom the
Jews thought that they were first to propitiate, in order that they might in the
same manner pacify God. For superstition is never satisfied with the one only
true God, but seeks many gods, as we shall hereafter see in the 35th verse
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;243235&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
32:35), where Molech is mentioned, being added to Baal. And the Prophet says
here, that they had poured
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>libations to foreign
gods</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We hence see that Baal includes
idols of every sort.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they might provoke
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By these words God intimates, that
no ignorance could have been pretended by the Jews, for they had been more than
sufficiently taught from the Law how God was to be worshipped; and a rule had
been also prescribed to them to worship God alone: but they worshipped many
gods, and according to their own fictitious superstitions. Justly, then, does
God here complain that they had, as it were, purposely provoked him, for
ignorance could not have been made a pretext, since the doctrine of the Law was
sufficient to guide them. It now follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

as yet true religion continued at Jerusalem. By mentioning then the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>children of
Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he no doubt aggravated their
guilt, intimating that they had fallen together with the Israelites, while yet
they had for a time been preserved. The Israelites had become degenerated,
afterwards the whole seed of Abraham became implicated in the same defection, so
that they forsook the true worship of God. But afterwards he mentions only the
children of Israel, but he includes also the tribe of Judah. For it ought to be
observed, that when Scripture connects Israel with Judah, Israel then means the
ten tribes, and that for the sake of honor or reproach the house of Judah is
referred to separately; from the kingdom of Israel; but that when Israel is
alone mentioned, it includes generally all the children of Abraham without
exception. So it is in this place, when he says that the children of Israel and
the children of Judah had done nothing but provoked God. Afterwards he mentions
only Israel, and includes the twelve tribes.</font><br></div>

fF68</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We hence see that every ground of
complaint is taken away from the Jews, because God, by long forbearance, had
deferred his vengeance, for he might have punished them many ages before. As
then they had never ceased to provoke God, the rigor shewn to them could not
have appeared too much, for he had, in his goodness, invited them to repentance,

judgment of God. Whenever then God declares that men have sinned before his
eyes,<i> </i>he means that it is in vain for them to seek subterfuges, by
alleging their good intentions, as they are wont commonly to say, because with
him is the authority to judge. But this truth he confirms, when he says, that

commands and the works of our hands, for whatever we obtrude on God besides his
Law is the work of our hands; but obedience is better than sacrifice. Then God
here expressly condemns all the inventions of men, as though he had said, that
however men may delight in their own superstitions, they are yet impious and
detestable, for it is not lawful to devise anything. For God having given us his
Law, has left nothing for us to do, except to follow what he has commanded; and

his judgment, because their iniquity had reached the highest pitch. It was a
dreadful judgment when the city was wholly demolished by fire, and the Temple
destroyed. Hence the atrocity of the punishment might have driven many to
complain that God was too severe. Here he checks all such complaints, and says,
that the <i>city </i>had been <i>built </i>as it were for this end, even to
provoke him, as we say in French, <i>Elle a este faite pour me depiter, pour me
facher. </i>Some read, &#8220;Reduced to me has been the city;&#8221; but they
pervert and obscure the meaning. It might more properly be rendered, &#8220;The
city has been destined to me for my wrath and indignation.&#8221; But the
meaning which I have given is simpler. Thus the words

<i>aphi, </i>and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ytmj</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
chemeti, </i>are to be taken passively, even that the city Jerusalem had been in
a manner devoted to this madness, so that it ceased not to inflame more and more
against itself the vengeance of God. In a word, he repeats in other words what
he had before said, even that the children of Israel did nothing else than
provoke God by their misdeeds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is then nothing new said here, but as it was a
thing difficult to be believed, the Prophet dwells on it, and says, that the
city Jerusalem </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had been for the
wrath and indignation of God, from the time in which it had been
founded</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And we may gather from the end
of the verse that this is the true meaning, for he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Even to this day, that I should
remove it from my sight</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as though he
had said, that the Jews had made no end of sinning, so that it was now quite the
time to punish a people so wicked, whose impiety was un-healable. And he points
out their persistency when he says,

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse is connected with the last: God had
complained, that the city had been so perverse in its character, that it seemed
to have been founded and built for the purpose of seeking its own ruin by its
sins. He confirms that declaration by adding, On
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>account of all the wickedness of
the children of Israel, and of the children of Judah. By all the wickedness
</i></font><font face="Palatino">or evil, he means what he before said, that
they had been doing only evil, for they had offended not only in one thing, but
had abandoned themselves to impiety, so that there was nothing pure or honest
among them; for they had given themselves up to impiety, so that they omitted
nothing that was calculated to provoke God. A universal blot is extended to
every part of life, as though he had said, that they were imbued with so much
wickedness, that no sound part remained in them. It is possible for man&#8217;s
body to labor under one or two diseases, while there may be soundness in some of
the members; but the Prophet means here, that the Israelites had become so
corrupt, as it is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;191401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
14:1, that nothing remained whole among them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now God condemns here all ranks of men: in the first
place he says, that the <i>kings </i>had sinned; for they not only themselves
had forsaken the true worship of God, but had become the cause of defection or
apostasy to others. To kings he adds <i>princes, </i>or counsellors, and then
<i>priests </i>and <i>prophets. </i>And, doubtless, the kings with their
counsellors ought to have been one eye, the priests and the prophets the other;
for the two eyes in a true and legitimate government are the judges and the
pastors of the Church. But the Prophet says, that the kings and their
counsellors had been ungodly, and then that the priests and the prophets had
been implicated in similar crimes. And it was indeed something monstrous to see
such blindness and madness in those priests whom God had, by a hereditary right,
set over the Church as the interpreters of the Law, according to what is
said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The<i>
</i>priest&#8217;s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the Law at
his mouth, for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;390207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Malachi
2:7)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And when the priests failed in their office, either
through ignorance or sloth, God raised up prophets in their place, and his
purpose was to prevent by such a help the ruin of his Church. But Jeremiah says,
that the prophets had become like the priests.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage deserves to be carefully noticed; for we
see how delighted many are when the Church is disturbed by discords; for they
think that they are thus excused, when they cast aside every care and every
concern for religion; and many indulge in this kind of indifference. But if the
faithful had been so careless at that time, must not religion have a thousand
times vanished away, having been wholly extinguished and obliterated from their
hearts? Let us then learn, that though false prophets may rise and obscure pure
doctrine by their fallacies, and though the sacrificers should become apostates,
and raise up, as it were, a banner to demolish the whole Church &#8212; yet let
us learn to be firm; for our faith ought not to be shaken, though the whole
world were in confusion, nay, though Satan mingled heaven and earth together. In
short, it is the real trial of our faith, when we firmly abide in God&#8217;s
truth at the time when Satan attempts above all things to throw everything into
confusion. For Jeremiah does not speak here of the Egyptians or the Assyrians,
but of the chosen people, the children of Abraham, the sacred heritage of God;
and yet he says that the priests and prophets had become leaders to the people
in their sinful courses, so that they cast aside the true worship of God,
perverted the Law, and in short, departed from religion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and the men of Judah and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He speaks not
of the Israelites, who had long ago become polluted, and had abandoned
themselves to ungodly superstitions, for they had become, as it were, aliens to
the people of God; but he names only the Jews, who remained alive, that
God&#8217;s Church might continue in the world. He proceeds by degrees, for he
mentions the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the last place. It was indeed less to
be endured that those, who had the Temple before them, who were constantly
reminded of God&#8217;s true worship, should be apostates, than if they dwelt in
villages; for those who lived in the country, and were wont to come to the
Temple three times a year, had apparently some excuse. But as the citizens of
Jerusalem enjoyed so many religious means, as the Law of God continually sounded
in their ears, as the sacrifices were as trumpets by whose blast they were
summoned to serve and fear God, it was, as we have said, a great aggravation to
their guilt. Hence the Prophet, for the sake of a greater reproach, joins them
to the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>men of
Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It follows &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet expresses more clearly the
perverseness of the people, as though he had said, that they had deliberately
rejected every instruction, and had shewn no regard for God; for he who turns
his back on us, does this knowingly and wilfully, and indeed not without
contempt. When any one addresses me, and I look another way, is it not a
manifest sign of contempt or disdain? and he who speaks, does he not see that he
is disregarded? Thus God then complains that the Jews had not fallen away
through ignorance, but as it were through a premeditated obstinacy:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they

fF71</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>when yet they ought to have been
attentive to hear the doctrine of the Law. For God shews to us his face<i>
</i>whenever he is pleased to prescribe what ought to be done, or to shew the
way of salvation. When he looks on us, how detestable must be our pride, if we
look not also on him in return? This, then, is the first thing, that the Jews<i>
</i>had knowingly and wilfully despised God and his Law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he amplifies their guilt by saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I taught them, I rose up
early and taught them, and they hearkened
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF72</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>If the Law had been only once
promulgated, the Jews might have objected and said, that they were for the most
part illiterate; but no color of pretense remained for them, since the Prophets
were continually interpreting the Law, as God had also promised by
Moses,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;A Prophet will I
raise up for thee from the midst of thy brethren.&#8221;

18:18)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For he intimates that this benefit would be perpetual
in the Church, so that there would never be wanting Prophets to shew the right
way to the people. For he sets Prophets in opposition to soothsayers, diviners,
foretellers, and all other ministers of Satan, as though he had said, that there
was no reason for the people to seek the fallacies of Satan, since the Prophets
were sufficient. Lest the Jews<i> </i>then should complain that they were hardly
dealt with, God here shews that he had taught them, for he ascribes to himself
what he had done by his Prophets: and doubtless Prophets and teachers<i> </i>are
nothing else but the instruments of the Holy Spirit; for no one is fit to teach,
but when he is guided by the Spirit of God. Justly then does God claim for
himself these offices,<i> </i>so that all the praise for the building up of his
Church is due to him, though he employs the labors of men. In this sense it is,
that he says, that he had taught<i> </i>them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rose up
early</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, that he had been
sedulous. As a master of a family, who is solicitous for his own, early inquires
how they are, and looks around the whole house; so also God represents himself
here, speaking of his care in teaching the Israelites, as though he had said,
that not only his Law was set before their eyes, by which they might learn what
was right, but that Prophets were also given who ceased not to admonish and
exhort them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this manner of speaking ought to be particularly
observed, as we hence learn how base their ingratitude is who reject the
teaching of the Prophets; for they not only disregarded men, but God himself, as
Christ also declares,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;He who hears you,
hears me; and he who rejects you, rejects me.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;421016&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Luke
10:16)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This form of speaking, then, commends the truth of
the doctrine taught by the Prophets; for God comes forth and shews that he
speaks by his servants. And on the other hand, we learn what an incomparable
blessing it is to have faithful and true teachers; for God, through them and
their labors, with certainty declares that he cares for our salvation, as though
he watched over us, as though he rose up early, as though he visited us; and the
preaching of the Gospel is not without reason called the visitation of God.
There is, then, no reason for us to seek anything better, when God is present
with us by his word; for we have a sure testimony of his presence whenever true
and faithful teachers rise up.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,

been intractable, for they refused to be corrected. The word is, indeed, taken
sometimes for doctrine, but it means here correction, even when any one, who
generally holds a right course, deviates from the right way, but being warned,
repents. We hence see what the Prophet means, even that the Jews had not only
closed their eyes against the clear light which shone forth in the Law, but that
they had been wholly refractory, so that they could not be subdued when God
called them to repentance, that when he sought to heal their diseases, they
showed such stubbornness that they cast aside all correction and
discipline.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">

he appointed,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">As God then had expressly testified that sacrifices
are not acceptable to him except in one Temple, and on one altar, he shews here
that the lawful worship had been corrupted by the Jews, even because they caused
their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire in honor to Molech. And
yet<i> </i>in a former passage he calls him Baal. Hence it appears, as we said
yesterday, that the word Baal includes all kinds of idols. For the Jews, no
doubt, while they worshipped their Baalim, ever wished to ascribe to the one
true God the chief sovereignty, but, at the same time, they devised patrons for
themselves, and hence was the multitude of their gods. But Molech was a
particular deity, as we learn from other parts of Scripture.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, perceive the Prophet&#8217;s meaning,
&#8212; that the Jews had not been satisfied with one kind of idolatry, but
built high places or altars for themselves; for so do some explain

word <i>&#8220;altars.&#8221;</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF75</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As to the main point, God no
doubt condenms the Jews here, because they had dared to set up a foreign mode of
worship in the valley of Hinnom, when the Law expressly forbade it. The relative
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
asher, </i>as I have said, may be applied to the altars as well as to Baal. But
it seems to me a more suitable meaning, if we say that Baal himself, that is,
the idol, was in the talley of Hinnom. Of the passing through the fire, I have
spoken elsewhere &#8212; it was a kind of lustration. There is no doubt,
however, but that some exceeded the moderation commonly observed, who wished to
excel others in the fervor of their zeal; for they actually burned their sons
and their daughters, which was a deed the most savage. But they yet thought that
it was a service acceptable to God. Others performed their superstition in a
milder manner, as they deemed it enough that their children should pass through
the fire as a symbol of purification, as also the heathens were wont to purify
themselves.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF76</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet speaks of <i>sons </i>and of

Jews, that they not only prostituted themselves before their idols, but also
contaminated their offspring with these defilements.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He at last says, that he had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>commanded

mind</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We have said elsewhere, that
whenever this manner of speaking occurs, God cuts off every handle from
objectors, because the superstitious ever have something to allege as a pretense
when they are summoned to an account. We know that the Papists, by pretending
good intentions, confidently glory against God; and they think that this one
pretense is sufficient to defend them against all reproofs; and they think also
that the servants of God and the Prophets are too morose and scrupulous when
such an excuse does not satisfy them. But God, that he might not tediously
contend with the superstitious, assumes this principle, &#8212; that whatever
they attempt beyond the Law is spurious, and that, therefore, the inventions of
men cannot be defended by any disguise or pretense. Let us then know that true
religion is always founded on obedience to God&#8217;s will; and hence
everything devised by men, when there is no command of God, is not only
frivolous, but also abominable, according to what was said yesterday respecting
the work of the hands; and so here the command of God is set in opposition to
all the inventions of men. But as such declarations often occur, I now touch but
slightly on this passage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This doctrine, however, ought to be especially
noticed, that is, that there is no need of a long refutation when we undertake
to expose fictitious modes of worship, which men devise for themselves according
to their own notions, because, after all that they can say, God in one word
gives this answer, that whatever he has not commanded in his Law, is vain and
mischievous. He then says, that he had not
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>commanded
</i></font><font face="Palatino">this, and that it had never entered into his
mind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God in the last clause transfers to himself what
applies only to men; for it cannot be said with strict propriety of God, that
this or that had not come to his mind. But here he rebukes the presumption of
men, who dare to introduce this or that, and think that an acceptable worship of
God which they themselves have presumptuously devised; for they <i>seek </i>thus
to exalt their own wisdom above that of God himself. And we even find at this
day that the Papists, when we shew that nothing has proceeded from the mouth of
God of all the mass of observances in which they make religion to consist, do
always allege that they do not without reason observe what has been commanded by
the fathers, as though some things had come into the minds of men which had
escaped God himself! We then see that God in this place exposes to ridicule the
madness of those, who, relying on their own inventive wits, devise for
themselves various kinds of worship; for they seek, as we have said, to be wiser
than God himself. We<i> </i>now, then, perceive the force of the expression,
when God says that it never came to his mind, because men boast that it had not
been contrived without reason, and glory in their own acuteness, as though they
were able to appoint a better thing than God himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they should do this
abomination</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>God now goes farther, and
calls whatever he had not commanded an abomination. And this clause confirms
what I have before said, that there is no need of long arguments when the
question is respecting the inventions of men, for nothing can be approved of in
the worship of God but what he has himself commanded. Whatever therefore has
proceeded from the notions of men, is not only frivolous and useless, but it is
also an abomination; for God so represents it in this place. It is therefore not
enough at this day to repudiate and to treat with disdain the fictitious modes
of worship in which the Papists so much glory; but if we would prove that we
have a true zeal for religion, we must abominate all these fictitious things;
for God has once for all declared them to be abominable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that Judah might
sin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, that they might make Judah to
sin: either is admissible, and there is a twofold
reading.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF77</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> However this may be, he declares that
those who build not on the Law, do nothing but sin, though they may think that
they render to God the best service, even because they ought to have begun with
this principle, &#8212; to do nothing but according to what the Law prescribes.

<div><font face="Palatino">God has hitherto been shewing that the Jews were
worthy of that extreme punishment with which he had already visited the kingdom
of Israel, and that they could not complain of extreme severity, though they
were to rot in exile after the ruin of the city and the Temple, for they had
polluted the land which ought to have been sacred to God, and had everywhere
spread abroad their abominations, so that even the Temple was not free from
their filth and defilements, and they had not thus offended for a short time,
but, as we have seen, they had despised all warnings; and though God had been
solicitous for their safety, they had yet proudly rejected and even extinguished
his favor. As then they were of a disposition so wicked, and their impiety had
become altogether incurable through so much hardness, God shews that he would
render to them the reward due to their works, by wholly rejecting them. But now
he adds the promise of favor, in order to shew that he would in such a manner be
the avenger of wickedness, as ever to have a regard for the gratuitous covenant
which he had made with Abraham.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have already said often, that whenever God
mitigates the bitterness of punishment with some hope of mercy,<i> </i>he has a
peculiar respect to his chosen people. The word then is not indiscriminately
addressed to all, when God declares that he will be at length merciful and
propitious, for he encourages his chosen people alone, as I have said, to
entertain hope. As then there were some godly seed remaining among the people,
God intended to relieve them, so that they<i> </i>might not wholly
despond.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see the Prophet&#8217;s object; and this truth
ought to be carefully observed; for we shall be mistaken as to the doctrine
taught by the Prophets, except we know, that after having threatened the wicked
and the despisers of God, they then turn their discourse to the elect, to<i>
</i>encourage them to bear patiently and with calm minds the punishment laid on
them, as Jeremiah did in his own case when he exhorted the faithful to lay their
mouth in the dust, and then patiently to wait for God, though he would for a
time hide his face from Jacob, that is, from his Church. Jeremiah then, after
having shewn that the Jews could not be too severely treated, because they had
been wholly intractable, now adds,-</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And now therefore, thus saith
Jehovah, the God of Israel, concerning this
city</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, to this city. The preposition
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">la</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>al, </i>signifies both, but it is more suitable to take it here in the sense
of &#8220;concerning:&#8221;<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of
which</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye say that it has been delivered
into the hand of the king of
Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF78</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This does not seem to be
consistent with facts, for the Jews themselves had not announced this sentence
respecting Jerusalem, but on the contrary they sturdily rose up against the
Prophets, and made a clamor whenever the ruin of the city was announced. What
then is meant when God upbraids them with speaking in this manner? To this I
answer, that this had indeed proceeded from the Spirit of God, and also that the
Prophets had been the testifiers and heralds of this punishment; but when the
Jews saw that they could not escape, they then had such a dreadful apprehension
of God&#8217;s judgment, that they became wholly stunned with fear; and thus it
always happens to the despisers of God, for except he presses hard on them, they
scorn all his threatenings; or they think that fables are told them, when God
announces that he will execute on them his vengeance. But when they come to
extremities, they are filled with amazement, and without any hope confess only
that God is angry with them; hence their despair. The Prophet then does not
without reason upbraid them with this &#8212; that they said that the city was
delivered up to the Chaldean king, even while he was not only assailing it with
a strong army, but was also assisted by the sword, the famine, and the
pestilence as his associates. For before the siege pressed hard on them, they
esteemed as nothing, according to what we have seen, all that Jeremiah declared
to them; for he lost all his labor for nearly forty years, though the prophecy
concerning the ruin of the city, exile, the rejection of the people, and the
abolition of all holy things, was proclaimed daily. But now when they saw that
the affair was serious, and that they could not escape God&#8217;s vengeance,
they went to another extreme, and said, that God was false in his promises, that
his covenant was void and useless, that they had in vain worshipped him, that he
had deceived them and had given them false hopes, when he promised that he would
dwell in the midst of them. It is, then, in this sense that they said, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>city was delivered up into the
hand of the king of Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>it was the
same as though they had said, that the hope of return had been cut off. For they
wholly cast away the favor held forth by God, and said that all that Jeremiah
had promised was vain, because terrors had laid such hold on their minds and
feelings, that they could not entertain any hope of God&#8217;s
mercy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I have said that the case with all the reprobate is,
that they deride God while he spares and bears with them; but when they find
that he is a judge, then they do not look to his mercy, but he prostrate in
despair as though they were lifeless.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now understand what the design of the Prophet was,
when he spoke of the Jews as saying, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>city was delivered up
</i></font><font face="Palatino">to the Chaldeans and the Babylonians, even
because the promised deliverance could afford them no comfort, inasmuch as they
fully believed that their salvation was hopeless. <i>Ye </i>then <i>say, </i>he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the city has been
delivered up; but I</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will gather them from all the
lands to which I shall drive them in my wrath and hot displeasure and great
indignation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF79</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here God promises that the exile would only be
temporary, because he would at length gather, as it is said in Psalm 147:2, the
dispersed of Israel. No name is here expressed, but a pronoun; there is however
no ambiguity, for it is sufficiently evident that he speaks of the Jews when he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will gather
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As they had been scattered here
and there, the gathering of them might have appeared incredible; for had they
been only driven from their own country, and a place of exile had been granted
them where they might have lived together, they might have hoped some time to
return: but the scattering took away every hope, for they had been driven into
different countries, and far distant from each other. In order then to obviate
this difficulty, God expressly says that he would restore them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from all the lands into which he
had driven them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And the Prophet no
doubt alludes to a passage in Deuteronomy 30:4,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Though<i> </i>they
be scattered to the four quarters of the
world,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">I will thence gather
them.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As then God had through Moses promised, that though
they were banished into the farthest parts of the world, yet their restoration
would not be difficult to him; so the Prophet applies this declaration of Moses
to his own prophecy, even that God would gather from the whole of the East those
who had been scattered.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in my wrath, hot displeasure, and
great
indignation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF80</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God does not here speak of his
wrath, but in order that the Jews might perceive that they deserved so great a
punishment: for we know that as God is the judge of the world, nothing unjust
can belong to him. When therefore God&#8217;s wrath is said to be great, we may
with certainty conclude that the vices of men are great; for he is never angry
with us, except when he is offended by the greatness of our sins. We hence
perceive the reason why the Prophet mentions here the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wrath, the hot displeasure and
great indignation </i></font><font face="Palatino">of God, even that the
faithful might feel assured that God would be propitious to them, though they
were worthy of eternal ruin. In short, Jeremiah shews that there would be a
place for God&#8217;s mercy, though the Jews had merited destruction a hundred
times through their obstinacy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he adds that his favor would be continued,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will cause them to dwell
safely</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>After having promised to them a
return, he promises now a tranquil condition: for it would have been better for
the Jews to remain always in exile and in foreign lands, than to return to their
own country and to live there in misery. This was the reason why the Prophet
expressly added, that there would be a quiet habitation for
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we know that this was not fulfilled when the Jews
returned to their own country; for they were greatly harassed by their
neighbors, and the building of the Temple was at first hindered, and they
endured many troubles from all quarters, and at length they were oppressed with
tyranny by the Syrian kings, and reduced to such extremities, that exile would
not only have been more tolerable, but even pleasanter and more desirable, in
comparison with the many miseries with which they were oppressed. But, as it has
been said elsewhere, whenever the Prophets prophesied of the return of the
people, they extended what they taught to the whole kingdom of Christ. For
liberation from exile was no more than the beginning of God&#8217;s favor: God
began the work of true and real redemption when he restored his people to their
own country; but he gave them but a slight taste of his mercy. This prophecy,
then, with those which are like it, ought to be extended to the kingdom of
Christ. He afterwards adds, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This promise held the first place in the restoration
of the Church; for had the Jews been filled to satiety with wealth and plenty,
and all variety of blessings, their condition would still have been by no means
superior, had they not been the people of God; for men have no happiness, if
they live only on the good things of this earthly and frail life, or on its
pleasures and delights. Most truly it is said in the Psalms,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Happy is the
people whose God is
Jehovah.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(Psalm
144:15)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For though God commands his own blessings, and
designs them as testimonies of his paternal favor towards the godly, yet he will
not have them to live as it were on these; but he raises up their minds by
means, as it were, of these steps to the spring-head of true felicity, the very
fountain itself, so that they may know that they are under his protection, and
that he will ever be a Father to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that the Prophet, when he spoke of the
restoration of the people, propounded to them the chief and the most desirable
thing, even to know that God was reconciled to them, and that they were become
thus his people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence learn, that though God in his kindness bore
with the infirmities of his ancient people, and so mentioned the fruitfulness of
the land and other things, yet the end of all the promises was spiritual; nor
would have this promise been true, were it explained only of God&#8217;s
temporal blessings. For we must bear in mind that saying of the
Prophet,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Thou art our God,
we shall not die.&#8221;<i> </i>(Habakkuk 1:12)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And doubtless the Prophet in the Psalm which we have
just quoted, meant to distinguish the Church of God from all heathen nations,
and meant also to distinguish the felicity of the Church from all the pleasures,
honors, and those advantages, by which men persuade themselves they can be made
happy, provided they obtain them. Since then the Prophet there marks the
difference between the felicity of the Church and all the fleeting and empty
things wished for by those who look no higher than to this world and the present
life, it follows, that whenever these words are mentioned, &#8220;I<i> </i>will
be your God,&#8221;<i> </i>the hope of an eternal and a celestial life is set
before us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is another thing to be noticed, &#8212; that
whatever we seek as to the things of this world can yield us no real good,
except God be reconciled to us. When therefore we have all things in abundance,
when nothing is wanting as to every kind of pleasure, when we are favored with
great wealth, when peace and security are granted to us, yet all this, as I have
said, will prove ruinous to us, except God owns us as his children, and becomes
a Father to us. Therefore when we seek to become happy, we must direct our minds
to the principal thing, even to be reconciled to God, so that we may be able
with confidence to call him our Father, to hope for salvation from him, and ever
to flee to his mercy. Ungodly men desire this and that, as their own cupidity
leads them: the avaricious wishes for a large quantity of money, wide farms, and
great revenues; the ambitious seeks to subdue the whole world; the man of
pleasure wishes for everything that may satisfy his lusts, and even he who seems
to be moderate, yet desires what is suitable to his disposition; and thus God is
neglected, and also his grace. Let us then know that the wishes of men are
wholly unreasonable, when they anxiously seek anything in this world except what
flows from this fountain, even from the gratuitous favor of God, and when they
do not prefer this singular privilege to all blessings, even that God may be
reconciled to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now apprehend the meaning of the words, when God
declares that the Jews, after their return to their own country, would become
his people, and that he would be their God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us at the same time observe, that though God
possesses the sovereignty of the whole world, he is not yet properly called the
God of any,<i> </i>but of his chosen people; for as he gathers the Church for
himself as a peculiar treasure, as he speaks everywhere, so this privilege
cannot exist without a mutual relationship, that is, exept men know that God is
their God, and are also fully persuaded that they are counted by him as his
peculiar people. Now follows an explanation of this verse, which, on account of
its brevity, might seem somewhat obscure.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He more clearly explains the last verse; for he
mentions the effects of the favor referred to. God indeed includes everything in
one word, when he declares that he will be our God, for he thus adopts us as his
children. Hence comes the certainty as to our heavenly inheritance, and also as
to his mercy, which is better than life. There is then nothing that can be
desired beyond this benefit, that is, when God offers himself to us, and deigns
to receive and embrace us as his people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as I have already said, we do not fully
comprehend the benefit of this doctrine; for, first, we are very tardy and dull,
we perceive not what God means by this expression, and then we know how much our
nature is prone to diffidence, so far is the distance between us and God. Hence
this doctrine has need of explanation. Therefore the Prophet, after having
pointed out the cause and the beginning of all blessings, now mentions the
effects, which more fully confirm what he had said. Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I willgive to them one heart and
one way, that they may fear me for ever</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:
</i>for God does not otherwise own us as his people, nor can he be our Father,

Prophet here speaks. But I must defer the rest until to-morrow.</font><br></div>

and in the meantime remain quiet in dependence on thy protection, and
courageously fight to the end,<i> </i>not doubting but that through thy favor
all things shall turn out for good, until we shall at length enjoy that eternal
and glorious inheritance, which is laid up for us in heaven, through Christ our
Lord. &#8212; Amen</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND THIRTY-FIRST</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We began yesterday to explain the words of Jeremiah,
in which are promised to the people
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a new heart and a new
way</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Now, as God promises these, it is
certain that they are in his power, and not in the power of man. We hence learn
that it is not in man to form his heart for God&#8217;s service; for it would
have been a superfluous, nay, an absurd promise, had God said, that he would
give us a heart which was already ours, or which any one might confer on
himself. The promises, then, are sure evidences of God&#8217;s favor, not only
as to the end and effect, but also in order that we may know that God ascribes
to himself the praise of all these things which he promises to us. And it is
with this argument that <i>Augustine </i>often fights against the Palagians, and
rightly, because it would be a mere mockery, as I have said, had God promised
anything, which depended not on his favor, but on the will and power of
man.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he now speaks of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he refers to union and consent,
but of such a kind that they all obey God. Men often unite together for evil,
and the children of God are often compelled to separate themselves from the
ungodly; and hence are those discords which now prevail in the world, the blame
of which is cast on us. But as it is necessary for us to separate from the
Papists if we wish to follow God, it is better a hundred times to separate from
them than to be united together, and thus to form an ungodly and wicked union
against God. Agreement or union is, indeed, singularly a good thing, because
there is nothing better or more desirable than peace. But we must ever bear in
mind, that in order that men may happily unite together, obedience to
God&#8217;s word must be the beginning. The bond, then, of lawful concord among
us is this &#8212; that we obey God from first to last; for accursed is every
union where there is no regard to God and to his word.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must also observe, that when God promises one
heart, he adds </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one
way</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and this is to be understood of
outward works. And Paul seems to have borrowed from this place when he says that
God gives us to <i>will </i>and to <i>do </i>according to his good pleasure.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;503813&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
2:13) He mentions &#8220;to<i> </i>will&#8221; first, and the Prophet names the
<i>heart, </i>and the heart, we know, is the seat of all the affections. By
<i>one heart, </i>then, the Prophet means united affections; and then by <i>way
</i>he means what Paul expresses by &#8220;to<i> </i>do;&#8221; for it is not
enough &#8220;to<i> </i>will,&#8221; except &#8220;to do&#8221; be added to it;
while yet the external work is of itself of no value, except it be preceded by
the will and a genuine feeling.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, understand what the Prophet means:
first, he shows how God would become a God to Israel, even because he would give
them <i>one heart </i>and <i>one way. </i>We hence learn, as I have said, that
to change the heart, to put off or cast aside corrupt affections, is not in the
power of man, because it is a benefit that proceeds from God. But it would not
be sufficient for us to be formed for obedience, except God added another favor,
even to lead the will itself into action. With regard to concord or union, we
have said, that the principle of a right and lawful agreement is, to have regard
to God, to depend on his word, and, with one consent, to obey what he
commands.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">According to this meaning, he afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they may fear
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Hence, also, it appears that the
fear of God is not otherwise produced than by the regeneration of the Spirit.
For were men naturally inclined to fear God, it would not have been ascribed to
God and to his grace; and God claims nothing for himself except what is his own.
It then follows that the beginning of the fear of God is the regeneration of the
Spirit. But we ought to notice the words when he says, that he would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>give them one heart
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one
way</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>might fear
</i></font><font face="Palatino">him; for he does not say, &#8220;That they may
be able to fear me,&#8221; or, &#8220;That<i> </i>there may be a free option,
and yet a flexible will;&#8221; but he mentions, so to speak, the actual fear of
God, as the result of forming anew the hearts of
men.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF81</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This, I have said, ought to be carefully observed, because the Papists confess
with us that we are wholly weak as to what is good, and that all our faculties
are so corrupt, that the will cannot move itself, nor can any effect<i>
</i>follow, without the constant co-operation of the grace of the Holy Spirit;
but, at the same time, they imagine that the Holy Spirit does only one half of
the work in us; and hence the grace of the Spirit is called by them aid and
cooperation. We hence see how far we and the Papists agree; for they are ashamed
to deny, that man&#8217;s nature is so corrupted by original sin as not always
to need the grace of the Holy Spirit. But when God claims entirely for himself
whatever good there is in us, the Papists concede to him only the half, and
imagine a two-fold grace of God, a grace going before and a grace following.
What do the Papists mean, or what do they understand by this grace going before?
Even that God inspires us with good and pious feelings, so that if we wish we
may be free to follow what is right; for, as I have said, the Papists confess
that we are under the tyranny of the devil, and slaves to him, and that there is
no right will in men, <i>except </i>through the prevenient <i>(proeunte)
</i>grace of the Holy Spirit. But as I have already said, they talk vainly of
the grace of the Spirit, and say that it is an influence by which God enables us
to follow that which is right, if we have a will to do so. Thus, then, the grace
of God, according to them, leaves men in suspense, so that they are free either
to receive or to reject the grace of God. Afterwards, they join the subsequent
grace, which, in their view, is a reward; for if I assent to God, that is, if I
suffer myself to be ruled by his Spirit, and embrace the grace offered to me,
God will then reward me with another grace to confirm me in my right purpose.
And thus they confess that perseverance is in part the gift. of God; but they
always imagine it a co-operating grace. And then, as perseverance, according to
them, is God&#8217;s subsequent grace, and is, as it were, a handmaid, it ceases
to be grace, for it is rather the reward of merit. But what does the Prophet
say? </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will give them one heart
and one way, that they may fear
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that the grace of God is of itself
efficacious; and then he does not say that he would give them a power to turn
either way, but that he would give them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as the same thing is afterwards
more clearly expressed. We see then that the one heart or will is the work of
the Holy Spirit, and the mere favor of God. This ought in the flrst place to be
borne in mind. We further see that this grace works effectually in men; it not
only gives them a free option, but the actual work, as they commonly say,
follows, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they may fear
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and it is added, <i>all </i>their
<i>days. </i>Here God promises also perseverance as the singular gift of the
Holy Spirit; for it would not be sufficient that our hearts should be formed for
his service, were he not to sustain us in it; for such is our levity and
weakness; that we might every moment fall away from his grace. There is, then,
need of grace to preserve us. It hence appears, that not only the beginning of
good works proceeds from his Spirit, but also that he enables us to go on to the
end; for otherwise there would be no perseverance in a right
course.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That it may be well with them,
and with their children after them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By
these words he intimates, that the Israelites themselves had been the authors of
all their evils, because they had not feared God; for they could not have been
happy without continuing in obedience to him. And the Prophet confirms what we
said yesterday, that external prosperity is in itself evanescent; therefore we
ought to seek first the grace of God. But when is it that God is propitious to
us? Even when we know him as our Father, and obey his commandments; that is,
when we render ourselves submissive to him as it becomes children. It now
follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He pursues the same subject; but the repetition is
intended emphatically to recommend the grace of God, for we know how men ever
strive to withhold the praise due to his grace, and that on account of their
pride. God, then, on the other hand, celebrates in high terms his grace, lest
men should malignantly obscure it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He first says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will strike with them a
perpetual covenant</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We must notice the
contrast between the covenant of the Law, and the covenant of which the Prophet
now speaks. He called it in the thirty-first chapter a new covenant, and gave
the reason for it, because<i> </i>their fathers had soon fallen away after the
Law was proclaimed, and because its doctrine was that of the letter, and deadly,
and also fatal. But he now calls it a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>perpetual
covenant</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>That the covenant of the Law
was not valid, this was accidental<i> </i>to it; for the Law would remain in
force, were we only to keep it; but through men&#8217;s fault it happened that
the covenant of the Law became void and immediately vanished. When, therefore,
God promises anything, there is a manifest difference; but what is it? God
intimates that his doctrine is set before men with no effect, for it only sounds
in their ears, it does not penetrate into their hearts. There is, then, need of
the grace of the Holy Spirit; for except God speaks within and touches our
hearts, the sound will be to no purpose, only beating the air. We now, then, see
why the covenant is called perpetual which God now promises.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must, at the same time, bear in mind that this
covenant peculiarly belongs to the kingdom of Christ. For though it was a part
of God&#8217;s grace, which was manifested in delivering his people from
captivity, yet the continued stream of his grace ought to be extended to the
coming of Christ. The Prophet then, no doubt, brings Christ before us, together
with the new covenant; for without him there is not the least hope that God
would make another covenant, as it appears evident from the whole Law and the
teaching of the Prophets. Then Christ is here opposed to Moses, and the Gospel
to the Law. It hence follows, that the Law was a temporary covenant, for it had
no stability, as it was that of the letter; but that the Gospel is a perpetual
covenant, for it is inscribed on the heart. And for the same reason it is also
called a new covenant, for the Law must have become obsolete, since the
perpetuity of which the Prophet speaks has come in its place.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now follows an explanation,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because I will not
depart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. The
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>asher, </i>here is not a relative, but rather an explanatory or exegetic
particle. It then briefly designates the form or nature of the covenant, even
that God would never </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>depart from
behind them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>God is sometimes said to go
before his faithful people, when he shows to them the right way. He is said also
to rule them from behind, as when Isaiah says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;They<i> </i>shall
hear a voice behind them,
saying,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;This is the way,
walk ye in it.&#8217;&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;233021&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
30:21)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God no doubt testifies here, that he would be always
an Instructor and Teacher to his people. And he says, that he will speak from
behind, as schoolmasters follow the pupils committed to their care, even that
they may observe and watch all their gestures, walking, words, and everything
else. So God compares himself to those teachers to whom children are committed
to be taught and trained; and he says that he speaks from behind. We may then
explain what is here said in this sense, &#8220;I<i> </i>will not depart from
after thee:&#8221;<i> </i>but we may also take a simpler view that God would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not depart from
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>even because he would show them
perpetual favor and kindness, according to what is immediately added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that I may do them
good</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In a word, God shows that he would
be an eternal Father to his people, who would never forsake nor cast them
away.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF82</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the manner or method is also expressed, that he
would </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>put his fear in their
hearts, that they might never depart </i></font><font face="Palatino">from him.
This is the same doctrine with what we have already seen; it is now repeated,
but in other words; and thus God, as I said, more fully illustrates his favor,
he says then that he would <i>put </i>his <i>fear </i>in the <i>hearts </i>of
men. We now see how that puerile fiction is refuted, with which the Papists are
inebriated, when they say that God&#8217;s grace co-operates, because the Spirit
helps the infirmity of men, as though they themselves brought something of their
own and were co-operators. But the Prophet here testifies that the fear of God
is the work and gift of the Holy Spirit. He does not say I will give them power
to fear me, but I </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will put my
fear in their hearts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We then see that
he again shews that the Spirit works effectually in us, so as to form anew our
affections, and does not leave us capable of turning or suspended. The same
thing is said by Ezekiel,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;And<i> </i>I will
cause them to fear me.&#8221;<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;263627&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ezekiel
36:27)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus the same doctrine is confirmed there, for it is
said, that God would make Israel to fear him, not that they might be able to
fear him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds again,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they may not depart from
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We<i> </i>see that clearly refuted
are those foolish notions about neutral grace, which offers only power to men,
which they may afterwards receive<i> </i>if they please; for the Prophet says,
&#8220;that they may not depart from me.&#8221;<i> </i>Thus he again shews that
perseverance, no less than the commencement<i> </i>of acting rightly, is the
gift of God and the work of the Holy Spirit: and as I have already said, were
God only to form our hearts once,<i> </i>that we might be disposed to act
rightly, the devil might, at any moment, entice us, by his wiles, from the right
way, or, as he employs sudden and violent attacks, he might drive us up and down
as he pleases. To rule us then for one hour would avail us nothing, except God
preserved us through the whole course of our life, and led us on to the end. It
hence then follows, that the whole course of our life is directed by the Spirit
of God, so that the end no less than the beginning of good works ought to be
ascribed to his grace. Whatever merit then men claim for themselves, they take
away from God, and thus they become sacrilegious.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A question may, however, be here raised: we see that
the faithful often stumble, not ten times during life, but every day: how then
is this, that where God&#8217;s Spirit works, his efficacy is such that men
never turn aside from the right way? Were any to answer, that the faithful
indeed stumble, but do not wholly fail, and that God here refers to that
defection which shakes off every fear of God, it would not be a full solution.
For we see that even the elect themselves are sometimes like apostates, for the
fear of God and piety are, as it were, choked in them. Piety is not indeed
extinguished, but not even a spark of the Spirit appears in them. But we must
notice, that inflexible perseverance is given to the faithful, so that when they
fall, they soon repent. Hence interruptions are no hinderances that God should
not guide them from the starting-post to the goal, until they complete their
whole course. And thus true is what Augustine says, that the Spirit so works in
us, that we invariably have a good will. For he compares our state with that of
Adam, such as he was in his first creation. We know that Adam was then without
any stain, for he was formed in the image of God: he was then upright and free
from every vice. We are as yet imperfect; though God has regenerated us by his
Spirit, there abide in us still some remnants of the flesh, and we do not run
with so much alacrity as it behoves us; nay, we are constrained to exclaim with
Paul, that we are &#8220;wretched,&#8221; and to confess that we do not the good
which we would, but the evil which is hateful to us.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450715&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
7:15) Then the condition of Adam seems to have been better than ours. To this
Augustine replies, &#8212; that God deals better with us now than he did with
Adam, our first parent; for though he created him just and innocent, and without
any stain, yet he gave him a nature liable to a change; and hence Adam, having a
free-will, immediately fell. To what end then did free-will serve? even that man
immediately fell and brought us into the same ruin with himself. This is the
praise of free-will! even that man, possessed of it, cast himself down into the
lowest abyss, whence he could never of himself have risen. But now, with respect
to us, though we halt, and also turn out of the right way, and our depraved
lusts entice us to evil, and our corruption hinders us from running as we desire
to do, yet our condition is far better, because God endues us amidst all our
conflicts with the power of his own Spirit, so that we are never overcome or
overwhelmed. This indefectible constancy, <i>(indeclinabilis constantia) </i>as
Augustine calls it, is then far superior to the excellency and honor which Adam
at first possessed. This may be clearly gathered from the words of the Prophet
when he says, that God would </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>put
his fear in the hearts </i></font><font face="Palatino">of his people, so that
they may </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>never depart
</i></font><font face="Palatino">from him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may be again asked, why is there no mention made
of gratuitous justification? for the covenant of God cannot be valid, except he
reconciles us to himself, for regeneration is not sufficient for the obtaining
of God&#8217;s favor, as in part only we will rightly and act rightly. To this
we answer, that there is no doubt but that God includes faith in the word
<i>fear; </i>hence remission of sins, by which men return into favor with God,
is not excluded when regeneration is spoken of. This passage may at the same
time be explained in this way, that the Prophet states a part for the whole.
Doubtless the new covenant, as we have before seen, consists of two parts, even
that God, in adopting us as his children, forgives us, and pardons all our
infirmities, and then governs us by his Spirit: but here he speaks only of the
last. So the sentence may be viewed as including a part for the whole. Still the
Scripture, as it has been said, when it speaks of God&#8217;s fear, often
includes faith, for God, as the Psalmist says, cannot be feared, except we taste
of his goodness,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">When God says that he would take pleasure in doing
good to his people, he adopts the language of man, for fathers rejoice when they
can do good to their children. God then, as the paternal love with which he
regards his people could not have been otherwise expressed, made use of this
similitude. Further, the contrast also ought to be noticed, even that God had
rejoiced when he punished his people for their wickedness. For God delights in
judgment as well as in mercy. God then for a time rejoiced when he punished the
peopie; for as his judgment is right, he delights in it. But now he says that he
would manifest his paternal affection, so as to take pleasure in doing them
good.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will plant them in this
land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He had indeed planted them, when,
by Joshua, the possession of the land was given them, according to what is said
in the 80th Psalm, where a similar expression is used, even that God had brought
his vine out of Egypt, and planted it in the promised inheritance.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;198008&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
80:8) But afterwards the people were plucked up by the roots. Hence the first
possession of the land to the time of the exile was not, strictly speaking, a
plantation, for the people did not then strike firm roots. God then promises
here something new and unusual, when he speaks of a plantation. Nor is there a
doubt but the perpetuity, of which mention has been made, is intended; for this
plantation of the people depends on the covenant, and the covenant is not
temporary as before the exile, but perpetual in its duration.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand what the Prophet means when he
compares to a plantation the restoration of the people after their return from
exile. We know, indeed, that the people from that time had not been banished,
and that the Temple had ever stood, though the faithful had been pressed down
with many troubles; but this was only a type of a plantation. We must therefore
necessarily pass on to Christ, in order to have a complete fulfillment of this
promise. The beginning, as we have said, and I am often compelled to repeat
this, is to be taken from this return; but Christ is not to be excluded from
that liberation which was like the morning star, before the sun of righteousness
itself appeared in its own splendor. When Christians explain this passage and
the like, they leave out the liberation of the people from Babylonish exile, as
though these prophecies did not belong at all to that time; in this they are
mistaken. And the Jews, who reject Christ, stop in that earthly deliverance. But
the Prophets, as I have said, begin with the return of the people, but they set
Christ also in the middle, that the faithful might know that that return was but
a slight taste of the full grace, which was alone to be expected from Christ;
for it was then, indeed, that God really planted his people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Further, when the Jews were afterwards expelled from
the land of Canaan, it was owing to their ingratitude; and it was a total
abdication. In the meantime, however, God planted there his own vine until
Jerusalem was extended and had its limits in the farthest parts of the earth:
and we are said to be grafted in Christ and planted, when God adopts us into his
Church; and hence that saying of Christ,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Every tree which
my Father hath not planted shall be rooted up.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401513&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
15:13)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us then know that the Church was planted in
Judea, for it remained to the time of Christ. And as Christ has pulled down the
wall of partition, so that there is now no difference between Jews and Gentiles,
God plants us now in the holy land, when he grafts us into the body of
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in
truth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, faithfully, so as never
to pull them up again. And he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with my whole heart and with my
whole soul</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The words are indeed
singular, for God transfers to himself the affections and feelings of men; but
it is necessary that he should in a manner transform himself, that he may be
understood by us; for unless he prattled, where would be found so much
understanding as would reach the immense altitude of his wisdom? As then the
mysteries with which he favors us are incomprehensible, it is necessary that he
should accommodate himself to our limited capacities. By the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whole
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>then, and the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whole
soul</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he means that faithfulness and
constancy which will ever endure until the faithful shall obtain eternal life.
Integrity in man is called the whole heart, because there may be a double heart.
It cannot, it is true, be for this reason applied to God or to his nature. But
as I have already said, he says by a similitude that he would do this with the
whole heart, because he will do it so perfectly that there will be nothing
wanting to render salvation complete, and the same thing is also meant by
<i>truth; </i>though some philosophize more refinedly as to this word, for by
truth they understand the firmness or veracity of the
promises,</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF83</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But we know that according to the usage
of the Hebrew language, that truth means often what is solid and perpetual. He
means then that the plantation would be so firm and solid, that there would be
no danger that the people would ever be removed elsewhere, even because there
would be a living root, as we have explained: the Church was fixed in Judea
until the coming of Christ, who brought in the real accomplishment of this
plantation; for when we are grafted into him, we already in a manner possess
eternal life and are become the citizens of heaven.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">God shews here again to his Prophet that exile would
be temporary as to the remnant; for we know that the greater part of the people
had been wholly rejected; but it pleased the Lord, that his Church should
survive, though very small in number. Then this promise is not to be extended
indiscriminately to all the twelve tribes, but refers especially to the elect,
as the event sufficiently proved, and Paul also is a most faithful interpreter
of this truth. And this ought to be carefully borne in mind, because hypocrites
always steal for themselves whatever God promises to his faithful people, while
yet they falsely pretend his name. Let us then understand the design of God,
even that his purpose was to support with strong confidence his chosen, lest
despair should close up the avenue to prayer. Since, then, a portion of the
people remained, that the Church might not wholly be cut off, this promise was
fulfilled; and as we can never embrace the promise of mercy, except repentance
and acknowledgment of sin precede, the two things are here referred to by the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that God had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>made to
come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or had brought, a dreadful
calamity; and it then follows, that he would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bring
</i></font><font face="Palatino">on them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all the good
</i></font><font face="Palatino">that he had promised. By these words God
intimates that what he had before promised would not be difficult for him to
accomplish, because he could heal the wound which he had inflicted. Had the
Chaldeans, as it had been said elsewhere, taken the city according to their own
will, the remedy might have been difficult; but as God had employed the
Chaldeans, and as they had fought, as it were, under his banner, it was an easy
thing for him to restore the city, and to recall from exile those whom his
righteous vengeance had banished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must notice especially what is said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will render to them all the
good</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which I have spoken concerning
them. For God shews on what support the faithful were to rely in hoping for
their liberation; he bids them to depend on his own mouth; for whatever men may
promise is evanescent and without fruit. If, then, we would have our hope to be
firmly fixed, so that it may not disappoint us, let us learn to rely on
God&#8217;s promises, so that no one of us may presumptuously dream of this or
that, as we thus often deceive ourselves; but let us acquiesce in the word of
God. But when the evidence of God&#8217;s grace fails us, we may have recourse
to many confidences, but it will be without profit. We now perceive why the
Prophet expressly added this particular respecting God&#8217;s word. It follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms the prediction respecting the return of
the people, and makes application of the vision which had been presented to the
Prophet; for he had been commanded, as we have seen, to buy a field in the land
of Benjamin. God now then annects that sign to the prophecy; for the use of
signs is to secure faith to doctrine, which yet deserves of itself to be
believed, and is fully authentic, and of itself worthy of belief; it is however
conceded to our infirmity, that signs are given us, in order that the promises
may be more fixed and ratified in our hearts.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Deserted it is by man and
beast</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The chief men did not say this,
as we have elsewhere shewn; nay, when Jeremiah declared this to them, he was in
treated and cruelly dealt with by them; for it was a thing difficult to be
believed that the land, which was as it were the sacred habitation of God,
should be laid waste by the Chaldeans. God had indeed called it his rest, and it
had been given as a heritage to the children of Abraham. The Jews, then, did not
originate this saying; nay, it was God himself. But this question has been
solved elsewhere; they did not indeed speak of the desolation of the land in the
same sense or manner as God did; for when the Prophets threatened them with the
desolation of the land, they always added the hope of deliverance and of a
return; but they, when that calamity happened to them, cast aside every hope,
and gave themselves up wholly to despair. And it is a usual thing with the
ungodly to ridicule all God&#8217;s threatenings as long as he spares them or
defers their punishment; but when God makes it known that he speaks in earnest,
then they are swallowed up with despair, and conclude that nothing remains for
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This, then, is what Jeremiah upbraids his own nation
with, that is, that they cast off from themselves every hope, while yet God had
fixed for them the term of seventy years. While God then was stretching forth
his hand to them, they chose rather thus to sink in the abyss of despair, so
that nothing could alleviate their minds. This ingratitude the Prophet justly
condemns; for they considered their land as devoted to perpetual ruin, when yet
its restoration had been promised to them; as though he had said, &#8220;The
mercy of God and his faithfulness will surpass all your wickedness; but ye, as
far as you can, extinguish his promises, abolish his grace, and give no place to
his promises: nevertheless he will complete what he has promised; for though the
land is falsely deemed by you to be given up for ever to destruction, yet the
Lord will cause it to be inhabited by its own legitimate heirs, even the
children of Abraham.&#8221; This is the reason why he intimates that the Jews
had regarded the land as given up to perpetual desolation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To shew more fully what is said in the preceding
verse, he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fields with money
shall be bought, and by writing </i></font><font face="Palatino">(the verbs are

<div><font face="Palatino">This prophecy refers to the same subject; nor was it
to be wondered at, that God spoke so much of the same thing, for it was
necessary to render the Jews inexcusable, as they always pretended ignorance,
except God made frequent repetitions. And this was also the reason why Paul
said, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses everything should be
established, when he said that he would come the second and the third time to
Corinth.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;471301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 13:1) He intimated that his coming would not be useless, for except
they repented they could not have escaped by pretending ignorance, as hypocrites
are wont to do. It was, then, God&#8217;s purpose to confirm by many prophecies
what he had once testified respecting the restoration of the people; but he had
an especial<i> </i>care for the faithful, that they might not grow faint and
succumb under those many trials which remained for so long a time; for as some
died in exile, they might have forgotten the covenant of God, and thus the soul
might have perished with the body. And those who were to return to their own
country had need of no common support, so that they might continue firm for
seventy years, and rely with confidence on God&#8217;s mercy. We now, then,
understand why God repeated the doctrine as to the return of the
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is said that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah
</i></font><font face="Palatino">while he was yet in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prison</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Then the Prophet was bidden to consult the benefit of his enemies, and to
promote their welfare, however unworthy they were through their ingratitude; for
though they had not all demanded his death, yet the greater part of them had
clamorously condemned him, and he had been with difficulty delivered, and was
now lying in prison. It was a great cruelty that the people, while he was
faithfully discharging his prophetic office, should thus furiously rage against
him. He is, however, bidden still to proceed in the duties of his office, to
comfort them, to ease their grief, and to afford them some alleviation in their
evils and miseries.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is also no doubt but that it was profitable to
Jeremiah himself; for it was a most iniquitous reward, that he should, while
serving God faithfully and conscientiously, be cast ignominiously into prison,
and be there kept a captive so long. It was, then, some mitigation of his grief,
that God appeared to him in that very prison; it was an evidence that God
esteemed him higher than all the Jews. God did not then speak in the Temple, nor
throughout the whole city. The prison then was God&#8217;s sanctuary, and there
he gave responses to his Prophet, though he was wont to do this before from the
mercy-seat, from the ark of the covenant. We hence see how great was the honor
that God was pleased at that time to bestow in a manner on a prison, when he had
forsaken his own Temple.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now follows the prophecy, the substance of which is,
that though the city was to be given up into the hand of the king of Babylon,
yet that calamity was not to be perpetual, for God at length, after the
completion of seventy years, would restore it. But why this promise was given
has been stated already: it was given that the faithful might submit patiently
to God, and suffer themselves with calm minds to be chastised, and also recumb
on the hope the promise gave them, and thus feel assured, that as they were
smitten by God&#8217;s hand, their punishment would prove their medicine and an
aid to their salvation. Now, then, we perceive what this prophecy is, and also
for what purpose it was delivered.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But before God promised anything respecting the
return of the people, he strengthened the mind of the Prophet by a preface, and
also encouraged and animated the godly to entertain good hope. The preface is,
that God created and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>formed
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There was, then, no doubt but
he would at length rescue it from the hands of enemies; nay, that he would raise
it up even from hell itself. To prove this, he says that he is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>We hence see why the Prophet, before he recited the promise, honored God
with magnificent titles. But it is doubtful whether the past or the present time
is to be understood, when it is said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah the maker of it, Jehovah
the former of it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for either would be
suitable, &#8212; that is, that God at the beginning built Jerusalem and was its
founder, or that he had purposed again to create and form it anew. If the past
time be taken, then the meaning is, that the city, which had been built by God,
could not possibly perish, because his will was that it should remain
perpetually. And the same sentiment often occurs in the Prophets, and also in
the Psalms. For it was God&#8217;s design to be regarded as the founder of
Jerusalem, in order that he might distinguish it from all other cities of the
world. We know that there is nothing under the sun perpetual, for the whole
world is subject to various changes; nay,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;the fashion of
this world,&#8221; as Paul says, &#8220;passeth away.&#8221;
</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460708&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 7:81)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, then, changes so various take place in all
cities, God, by a singular privilege, exempted Jerusalem from this common lot;
and hence the Prophet truly and wisely concludes, that the ruin of the city
would not be perpetual, because God had formed it. And hence its future
restitution is sufficiently proved.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But if any one prefers the present time, then the
meaning would be, that he who had resolved to create and form Jerusalem is
<i>Jehovah, </i>the God of hosts: no one then can hinder his work. As this sense
is not unsuitable, I do not reject it, though I follow the former. We must, at
the same time, bear in mind this principle, &#8212; that restoration is promised
to the Jews, because Jerusalem had been, as it were, chosen by God, so that he
took it under his care and protection, so as to preserve it perpetually. Whether
then we take the words to be in the past or present time, that God is the
creator and former of Jerusalem, we see that the promise of deliverance is
founded on the mercy of God, even because he had cliosen Jerusalem for his own
habitation, according to what is in the Psalms,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;His foundations
are on the holy mountains.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;198701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
87:1)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And there, also, the pronoun is used instead of
God&#8217;s name, as here instead of the city&#8217;s name,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith Jehovah, who has
created it, who has formed it, that he might establish
it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here Jerusalem is not named; but the
narrative is much more emphatical than if it was expressed, as also in the place
we have just quoted, the word God is not given, nor the word Church, if I
mistake not, in the 37th chapter of Isaiah (Isaiah 37). When the Prophet
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;His foundations
are on the holy mountains,&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">there is no doubt but that the word God is to be
understood, though not expressed. So here, when speaking of the city, he says
that Jehovah </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>formed

it.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF86</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah is his

that the Jews might not set up against him what otherwise might have terrified
them, and, as it were, reduced them to a lifeless state, and caused them wholly
to faint away. He, therefore, sets before their eyes the power of God, as though
he had said, that there would be no obstacle which could delay God&#8217;s work,
for he had resolved to form and create anew his own city after its demolition;
it is, in a word, the same as though he had bidden the people to turn their eyes
and all their thoughts to God, to consider his immeasurable power, and so to
entertain hope, and thus to look down, as it were, from on high on all the
impediments which might have otherwise wholly weakened their
confidence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cry to me, and I will answer
thee, and I will announce to thee things magnificent and recondite, which thou
hast not known</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It was not so much for
the sake of the Prophet as of others that this was said. For the Prophet, no
doubt, had earnestly prayed, and his prison must have inflamed his ardor, so as
to intercede constantly with God. God then does not here reprove his torpor or
his sloth by saying, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cry to
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but as I have said, the word is so
directed to the Prophet, that God excites all the godly to pray. There is indeed
here an implied reproof, as though he had said that it was their fault that God
did not cheer their minds with a joyful and happy message, for they had closed
the door against themselves, so as to prevent God from offering them that
comfort which they yet </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>especially
</i></font><font face="Palatino">wished; but men, while they expect God to be
propitious to them, do not yet give entrance to his grace, because they bolt up,
as it were, their hearts with unbelief. We hence see why it was said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cry to me, and I will answer
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this passage ought especially to be noticed; for
we may hence conclude, that whenever we pine away in sorrow, or are worn out by
affliction, it is our own fault, because we are tardy and slow to pray: for
every one who cries acknowledges that God is always nigh, as he promises in the
Psalms, to those who truly call on him. That we are then sometimes worn out with
long grief, and no comfort given to us, this happens, let us know, through our
neglect and sloth, because we cry not to God, who is ever ready to answer us, as
he here promises.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will declare to thee great
things, and of hidden things thou knowest
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>So are the words literally; but
they cannot be thus suitably rendered: then we may read, &#8220;and things
hidden which thou knowest not,&#8221; or, &#8220;I will make thee acquainted
with hidden things which are unknown to thee.&#8221; It may, however, be asked,
why God called those things hidden, of which Jeremiah had already prophesied?
The answer is obvious, &#8212; that they had, as it were, made void all the
promises of God, and the holy man might, have been even confounded, when he saw
that God&#8217;s favor was thus rejected; for it was reasonable to conclude,
that as the people obstinately rejected the hope of deliverance, it was all over
with them, and that their condition was, as it were, hopeless. We hence see that
those things are often hidden to us which God has again and again made known to
us; for either they do not immediately penetrate into our minds, or the memory
of them is extinguished, or faith is not so vigorous in us as it ought to be, or
we are disturbed and confounded by obstacles thrown in our way.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now expresses what these hidden things were,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As to the houses, he says, (so it
is literally) thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, as to the houses of this
city, and as to the houses of the kings of
Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The proposition;
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l[</font><font face="Palatino">,
upon, often means with regard to, concerning. He names the <i>houses </i>of the
kings, for the kings of Judah were not satisfied, as it is well known, with one
palace, but had many houses without the city.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As to the
houses</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which had been thrown
down</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is variously explained; the
houses, say some, had been pulled down for the warlike engines, that is, that
these engines might be made from the materials, and for the sword. The sense,
however, would appear more obvious were we to take this view, that the houses
had been thrown down by the warlike engines, and also by the sword, that is, by
the violence of the enemies. The word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tlls</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
sallut, </i>as it has been already stated, is rendered by some fortifications;
but when the storming of cities<i> </i>is spoken of, it means no doubt warlike
machines, such as the engines to throw darts, or battering-rams: but we know not
in what form they were made by the Jews and the Chaldeans.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There are two parts to this prophecy, &#8212; that
the Jews were about to perish through their own fault, &#8212; and that they
were to be restored through the favor and goodness of God alone. Here, then, in
the first place, the Prophet condemns the false confidence<i> </i>of the people,
who stoutly resisted the Chaldeans.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
came</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to fight with the
Chaldeans</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but what would be the issue
of the battle? even to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fill</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with the carcases of
men their very houses</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>When he says that
the Jews were <i>come, </i>he speaks of what had already, as it were, taken
place. It is indeed a participle in the present tense, <i>coming; </i>but the
Prophet here sets before their eyes what was to be, as though he had said,
&#8220;The<i> </i>Jews will boldly rush forth, and will think themselves equal,
and even superior to the Chaldeans; thus they will arm themselves with courage
for the battle.&#8221; Then he says this, in order to ridicule the audacity of
the people. The sad issue of the fight follows, the filling of their own houses
with the carcases of men. The copulative is redundant, or it must be taken as
explanatory, and rendered, even.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall come
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to fight, evern that they may
fill their own houses with carcases</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and
thus inflame the fury of their enemies.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF87</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For it hence happened that the Chaldeans
shed more blood, and spared not the mass of the people; because we know that
when a city is won by force, more cruelty is exercised, and the slaughters
become much greater. Had the Jews willingly surrendered, they would have
received more humanity at the hand of their conquerors; but the Chaldeans became
implacable, because their fury had been kindled by the pertinacity of the people
fighting against them. God, at the same time, shews that the Chaldeans would not
be victorious through their own valor, but because he himself would <i>smite
</i>or slay the Jews. Then he ascribes to his own vengeance the calamity which
might have seemed to proceed from the Chaldeans; for Jeremiah could not have
exhorted the people to repentance except he shewed that it happened through a
righteous judgment, that the Chaldeans so cruelly raged against them. But we
must defer the rest until to-morrow.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that we may so
learn to humble ourselves under thy mighty hand, whenever thou chastisest us,
that we may not faint in our miseries, but flee to thy mercy with more
confidence, and by acknowledging our sins, may become so displeased with
ourselves, that we may never lose the taste of thy mercy<i> </i>but gird
ourselves up so as to entertain good hope, and call upon thee, until we shall at
length find by success that our prayers are not in vain; and may we ever thus
find comfort in our evils, so that we may at length enjoy that perfect felicity,
which thou hast prepared for us in heaven, through Christ our Lord. &#8212;
Amen.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND THIRTY-THIRD</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I was compelled yesterday to stop at the second
clause of the fifth verse, where God declares that the Jews were <i>slain </i>by
him, while they were exerting all their strength to resist. He then says that
that slaughter happened to the city and to the people, because they had sinned
against him. But he says, first, I have <i>slain </i>them, and then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have hid my face from this
city</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and he also adds the reason, on
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>accorent of all their
wickedness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Then he declares that he was
the author of that slaughter, and he also shews that in just judgment he
punished the wickedness of the people. For as they had never ceased for a long
time to provoke his vengeance, he here shews that they deserved that reward,
even of having their city forcibly taken by the Chaldeans, and also of being
everywhere slain, and of having their houses filled with dead
bodies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I will bring a renewal
and a healing, and I will heal them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>This is the main point, as they say, in the passage. He had been hitherto
shewing, that the Jews had deserved so heavy a punishment, because by their
obstinacy they had not ceased to provoke God against themselves. But he promises
here to be propitious to them after having moderately corrected them. For we
have said, that the design of this prophecy was to sustain the Jews, so that
they might not despond, but rely on the promise of favor, however bitter exile
might be. Then he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
bring a renewal</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or restoration,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and a
healing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF88</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And it is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will open to them abundance of
peace and of truth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some render the last
word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tma</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>amet, </i>prayer; for the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;ma</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
amen, </i>means sometimes to pray and also to multiply. There may then be a
twofold meaning; the first, that God would open to them an access to prayer; for
things were so hopeless among the people, that no one dared to utter a word.
Even Jeremiah himself was forbidden to pray,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;241114&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
11:14) because God had resolved to destroy those miserable men respecting whom
there was no hope of repentance. Some therefore understand that an access to
prayer is here promised, so that the faithful and the servants of God might pray
for the prosperity of the city. But this explanation seems to me to be too
far-fetched. I take, therefore, a simpler interpretation, &#8212; that God would
give them abundance of peace, or rather the prolonging or continuance of peace.
By peace is meant, as it is well known, a happy state. Then to Jerusalem,
reduced to extreme miseries, God promises joyful things, so that she should
afterwards live prosperously; and he adds the word <i>truth, </i>which is to be
taken here for stability,</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF89</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as, indeed, everywhere in Scripture, as
though he had said, that the prosperous state of the city would notbe for a
month, or a short time, but continual and even perpetual, as he declares in the
next verse.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">By the word <i>building, </i>God means that they
would return to their own country for this end &#8212; that they might remain
secure in it. And this promise was very needful, since the Jews were on every
side surrounded by enemies; for all their neighbors had united together against
them, and were most hostile, so that they never ceased to create new troubles.
For this reason mention is made of <i>building, </i>as though the Prophet had
said, that the prosperity of the city would be lasting, for it would be so
founded, that it would not fall or totter at any kind of
assault.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he promises deliverance,<i> </i>not only to the
tribe of Judah, but also to the whole kingdom of Israel. Though very few
returned, yet God offered the benefit which he had promised to all in common:
and then, as it has been often said, this promise is to be extended to the
coming of Christ. For God confined not his favor to those few years in which
liberty was granted to the Jews, when they returned from their exile in Babylon;
but included the eternal salvation which remained for them, of whiclx the
prelude was their return. Let us now proceed, &#8212; </font><br></div>

thing; but the words are not superfluous, for it was necessary seriously to
remind the Jews of their many vices, of which indeed they were conscious, and
yet they did not repent. As then they perversely followed their own wills, it
was needful for the Prophet to goad them sharply, so that they might know that
they were exposed to eternal destruction, if God&#8217;s mercy, and that by no
means common, came not to their aid. Here, then, he represents the greatness of
their sins, that he might on the other hand extol the mercy of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By the word

are not well acquainted with the language of Scripture; but
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rhf</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>theer, </i>means properly to expiate. This then does not refer to
regeneration, but to forgiveness, hence I have said, that the Prophet mentions
two things here in the same sense, &#8212; that God would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cleanse them from
iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, &#8212; </i>and that he would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pardon all their
iniquities</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We see now the reason why
the Prophet used so many words in testifying that God would be so merciful to
them as to forgive their sins, even because they, though loaded with many vices,
yet extenuated their heinousness, as hypocrites always do. The favor of God,
then, would never have been appreciated by the Jews had not the atrocity of
their guilt been clearly made known to them. And this also was the reason why he
said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will pardon all their
iniquities</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He had said before,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will cleanse them from all
iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>then he added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will pardon all their
iniquities</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For by this change in the
number the Prophet shews the mass and variety of their sins, as though he had
said, that the heaps of evils were so multiplied, that there was need of no
common mercy in God to receive them into favor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says further,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By which they have sinned against
me, and by which they have acted wickedly against
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>These words confirm what I have
already said, that the Jews were severely reproved by the Prophet, in order that
they might first consider and reflect on what they deserved; and secondly, that
they might extol the favor of God according to its value.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must at the same time observe, that the Jews had
their attention directed to the first and chief ground of confidence, so that
they might have some hope of a restoration; for the origin of all God&#8217;s
blessings, or the fountain from which all good things flow, is the favor of God
in being reconciled to us. He may, indeed, supply us bountifully with whatever
we may wish, while yet he himself is alienated from us, as we see to be the case
with the ungodly, who often abound in all good things; and hence they glory and
boast as though they had God as it were, in a manner, bound to them. But
whatever God grants and bestows on the ungodly, cannot, properly speaking, be
deemed as an evidence of his favor and grace; but he thus renders them more
unexcusable, while he treats them so indulgently. There is then no saving good,
but what flows from the paternal love of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must now see how God becomes propitious to us. He
becomes so, when he imputes not our sins to us. For except pardon goes before,
he must necessarily be adverse to us; for as long as he looks on us as we are,
he finds in us nothing but what deserves vengeance. We are therefore always
accursed before God until he buries our sins. Hence I have said, that the first
fountain of all the good things that are to be hoped for, is here briefly made
known to the Jews, even the gratuitous favor of God in reconciling them to
himself. Let us then learn to direct all our thoughts to God&#8217;s mercy
whenever we seek what seems necessary to us. For if we catch as it were at
God&#8217;s blessings, and do not consider whence they proceed, we shall be
caught by a bait: as the fish through their voracity strangle themselves, (for
they snatch at the hook as though it were food) so also the ungodly, who with
avidity seize on God&#8217;s blessings, and care not that he should be
propitious to them; they swallow them as it were to their own ruin. That all
things then may tuae to our salvation, let us learn to make always a beginning
with the paternal love of God, and let us know that the cause of that love is
his immeasurable goodness, through which it comes that he reconciles us freely
to himself by not imputing to us our sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may also gather another doctrine from this
passage, &#8212; that if the grievousness of our sins terrifies us, yet all
diffidence ought to be overcome, because God does not promise his mercy only to
those sinners who have slightly fallen, either through ignorance or error, but
even to such as have heaped sins on sins. There is therefore no reason why the
greatness of our sins should overwhelm us; but we may ever venture to flee to
the hope of pardon, since we see that it is offered indiscriminately to all,
even to those who had been extremely wicked before God, and had not only sinned,
but had also become in a manner apostates, so that they ceased not in all ways
to provoke God&#8217;s vengeance. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

that the Prophet did not speak only of the people&#8217;s return, and that this

a name to himself among all nations, but, as it is well known, only in some
portions of the east. When, therefore, he says that the favor he would shew to

done by the preaching of the Gospel, because then only was God&#8217;s goodness
towards the Jews everywhere made known, when the knowledge of the Law and of
prophetic truth came to aliens who had previously heard nothing of the true
doctrine of religion. We now then understand the design of the holy
Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Further, by these words God exhorts all to gratitude;

ought not to be indifferent, but to be stimulated to give thanks to him. When

it serves for a confirmation, when God intimates that he would be the Redeemer
of his people, in order that he might acquire to himself a name, for there is to
be understood a contrast, that in this kindness, he would not regard what the
Jews deserved, but would seek for a cause in himself, as it is expressed more
fully elsewhere,</font><br></div>

still the same; nor ought it to be deemed unreasonable that God testifies that
it would be to him for joy. For though he is not moved and influenced as we are,
yet this mode of speaking is elsewhere adopted, as in

104:31,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The Lord shall

<div><font face="Palatino">God then is said to take delight in doing good,
because he is in his nature inclined to goodness and mercy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they, shall fear and tremble for
all the goodness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lk</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
cal, </i>&#8220;all,&#8221; denotes greatness, and is to be taken emphatically.
The words, however, may at first sight appear singular, &#8220;they shall fear
and tremble for all the goodness,&#8221; etc.; for it seems not reasonable that
men should fear, when they acknowledge God&#8217;s goodness, for this, on the
contrary, is a reason for joy and confidence. This clause is sometimes applied
to the ungodly, for they have no taste for God&#8217;s favor so as to be cheered
by it, but on the contrary they fret and gnash their teeth when God appears kind
to his people; for they are vexed, when they see that they are excluded from the
enjoyment of those blessings, which are laid up, as it is said elsewhere, for
them who fear God. But I have not the least doubt but the Prophet means the
conversion of the Gentiles when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall fear
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tremble
</i></font><font face="Palatino">for all
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
goodness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc.; as though he had said,
that not only the name of God would be known among the nations, so that they
would proclaim that he had been merciful to his people, but that it would at the
same time be the effect and influence of his grace, that the nations would
become obedient to God. Moreover, it is a usual thing to designate the worship
and fear of God by the words fear, dread, and trembling. For though the faithful
do not dread the presence of God, but cheerfully present themselves to him
whenever he invites them, and in full confidence call on him, there is yet no
reason why they should not tremble when they think of his majesty. For these two
things are connected together, even the fear and trembling which humble us
before God, and the confidence which raises us up so as to dare familiarly to
approach him. Here then is pointed out the conversion of the Gentiles; as though
the Prophet had said, that the favor of deliverance to the Church would not only
avail for this end, to make the Gentiles to proclaim God&#8217;s goodness, but
would also have the effect of bringing them under his authority, that they might
reverence and fear him as the only true God. He again adds the word <i>peace,
</i>but in the same sense as before: he mentions goodness, the cause of
prosperity, and then he adds peace or prosperity as its effect. It afterwards
follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">These two verses are connected together, and have
been improperly divided, for the sentence is not complete. In the first place we
have, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yet shall be
heard</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>but what?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the voice of
joy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc., </i>as we find in the following
verse. Jeremiah confirms at large what he had taught respecting the return of
the people, because there was need of many and strong supports, that, the
faithful might </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>proceed
</i></font><font face="Palatino">in their course with
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>confidence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>It was indeed difficult to muster courage under so great a calamity; and had
they for a short season breathing time, yet new trials constantly arising might
have cast them down and laid them prostrate. There is no wonder then that the
Prophet here speaks diffusely of that favor which was deemed incredible; and
then the memory of it might not have always remained fixed in the hearts of the
faithful, had not a repeated confirmation been given.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He again introduces God as the speaker, that the
promise might have more effect.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Again</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be heard in
this place &#8212; even in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem
&#8212; the voice of joy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. He
repeats what we noticed yesterday, that the Jews put every obstacle they could
in the way of their restoration. The narrowness of our hearts, we know does in a
manner exclude an entrance as to God&#8217;s favor; for being filled, nay,
swollen with unbelief, we suffer not God&#8217;s grace to enter into us. So the
Jews,<i> </i>by desponding and imagining that their calamity was incurable, and
that no remedy was to be expected, rejected as far as they could the promised
favor of deliverance<i>. </i>This, then, is what the Prophet again upbraids them
with, even that they said that the whole country and all the cities were
destroyed, so that neither man nor beast remained. This was, indeed, the fact at
that time, and the Jews had spoken correctly; but as it was said yesterday,<i>
</i>the ungodly never feel the scourges of God without rushing headlong into
despair. Then what is condenmed is this, that the Jews thought that they were to
perish without any hope of deliverance. Hence the Prophet here reproves their
unbelief, and at the same time exhorts them to entertain hope. But he testifies
that God&#8217;s grace would surpass all their wickedness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Heard
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be the voice of joy, and
the voice of gladness; the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the
bride</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, marriages shall again be
celebrated. And this way of speaking often occurs in the Prophets when they
refer to the joyful condition of the city and of the people; for in seasons of
mourning no one thinks of marrying a wife, so that marriage-feasts then cease as
well as all festivals. Then the Prophet briefly shews that God would put an end
to the calamities of the people, and give them reasons for rejoicing after he
had for a time punished their sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he shews also of what kind their joy would be,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The voice of them who shall say,
Praise ye Jehovah of hosts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here he
distinguishes between the faithful and the ungodly, for joy is common to both,
when prosperity happens to them; for God&#8217;s children may rejoice when the
Lord shews himself to them as a bountiful Father. But the profane exult through
intemperate joy, and at the same time they make no mention of God, for they live
only on present things; but the faithful raise up their thoughts to God, and
never rejoice without thanksgiving. Thus they consecrate and sanctify their joy,
when the ungodly, by polluting God&#8217;s blessing, do also contaminate their
joy. We ought then to take special notice of this difference which the Prophet
here intimates, between godly and profane joy; for the children of this world do
indeed exult, but as we have said, immoderately in their joy; and they are
unthankful to God, and never duly reflect on his goodness; nay, they designedly
turn away their eyes and their thoughts from God; but the faithful have always a
regard to God whenever it succeeds well with them, for they know that everything
flows to them from God&#8217;s goodness only.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence he says, Heard shall be the voice of them who
shall say, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Praise ye Jehovah, for
he is good</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc. </i>The Prophet here
alludes to the customary practice of singing, which is spoken of in sacred
history. For we know that when the Temple was dedicated, the praises of God were
celebrated, and the Levites always sang,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For his mercy is for
ever</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>They first exhorted others to
praise God, and to every sentence this repetition was added, &#8220;For<i>
</i>his mercy is for ever.&#8221; What then had formerly been in common use the
Prophet refers to: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Heard
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be
</i></font><font face="Palatino">that usual song,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Praise ye Jehovah, for his mercy
is for ever</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Of them who shall bring praise to
the house of Jehovah; for I will restore the captivity of the
land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He mentions sacrifices, for the
service, according to the Law, required, that these should be added as evidences
of gratitude. God indeed had no need of vetires, nor did he delight in external
displays; but these exercises of religion were necessary for a rude people, and
still learning the elements of truth. The Prophet then speaks here with
reference to a particular time, when he connects sacrifices with praises and
thanksgiving, he yet shews for what end God required sacrifices to be then
offered to him, lest the Jews should think that God was pacified when a calf had
been slain. He then shews that all this had been prescribed to them, and
enjoined for this end &#8212; that they might shew themselves
thankful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This metonymical mode of speaking ought then to be
carefully observed; for hence we conclude, that sacrifices of themselves were of
no moment, but were only acceptable and of good odor to God on this account
&#8212; because they were evidences of gratitude.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the house of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Now, this also ought in the
last place to be noticed, &#8212; that it is not sufficient for one to be
thankful to God, but that public thanksgiving is also required, so that we may
mutually stimulate one another. And we also know that confession ought not to be
separated from faith; as faith has its seat in the heart, so also outward
confession proceeds from it; and therefore it cannot be but that the interior
feeling must break out from the soul, and the tongue be connected with the
heart. It hence follows, that all those are guilty of falsehood who say that
they have faith within, but are at the same time mute, and, as far as they can,
unworthily bury the benefits of God. And as I have said, this zeal is required
of all the godly, in order that they may stimulate one another to praise God;
for it was for this purpose and for this reason, that express mention is made of
the Temple; that is, that the faithful might understand, that God is to be
worshipped, not only privately and within closed doors, but that also a public
profession ought to be made, so that they may together with common consent
celebrate and acknowledge his benefits and blessings.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God, that as we cease
not to separate ourselves often from thee, we may at least know that

faith in thine only-begotten Son, and so return to thee as really to loathe
ourselves on account of our sins, and that relying on thine infinite mercy we
may never doubt but that thou wilt be reconciled to us, until having at length
finished our present course of life, and being cleansed from all the pollutions
of the flesh, we shall be clothed with that celestial glory, which thy Son by
his death and resurrection has obtained for us. &#8212; Amen.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah still pursues the same subject; but he
speaks here of the settled happiness of the people, as though he had said, that
there was no reason for the Israelites to fear, that God would not open for them
a way of return to their own country, and preserve and protect them after their
return. But in setting forth their quiet and peaceable condition, he speaks of
shepherds; for we know that it is a sure sign of peace, when flocks and herds
are led into the fields in security. For enemies always gape after prey, and the
experience of wars proves this; for whenever incursions are made by enemies,
they send spies that they<i> </i>may know whether there are any shepherds or
keepers of cattle; and then they know that there is a prey for them. As then
shepherds, when an invasion from enemies is dreaded, dare not go forth, and as
there is then no liberty, the Prophet, in order to intimate that the Jews would
be in a tranquil state, says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall again be in this
place the habitation of sheepherds, who will make their
sheep</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or their flock,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to lie
down</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive the design of the Prophet; for one
not sufficiently acquainted with Scripture might raise a question, Is this
promise to be confined to shepherds and herdsmen? But, as I have already
intimated, the answer is obvious, &#8212; The promise is general, but expressed
in this way, &#8212; that God would be the guardian of his people, so that
shepherds would drive here and there their flocks, and herdsmen their cattle, in
perfect safety, and without any fear of danger.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And in the next verse Jeremiah confirms the same
thing, where he mentions, as before, the cities of the mountains, and the cities
of the plains, and then the cities of the south, and adds also the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>land of
Benjamin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which was a different part of
the country, and he mentions generally the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>circuits of Jerusalem and the
cities of Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>What then?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
flocks</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall pass under the hands of a
numberer</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here, again, is set forth a
greater security, because shepherds would not, as it were, by stealth lead forth
their sheep, and afterwards gather them in a hurry, as it is usually done, when
there is any fear of danger. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
sheep</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall pass under the hands of a
numberer</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This could not be the case but
in time of perfect peace and quietness; for where there is fear, the shepherds
can hardly dare send forth their flocks, and then they dare not number them, but
shut them in; and they are also often compelled to drive their flocks into
forests and desert places, in order to conceal them. When, therefore, Jeremiah
mentions the numbering of them, he intimates that the whole country would be in
a state of peace, as in other words, and without a figure, he presently will
tell us. But the Prophet in this way exalted the benefits of God, and at the
same time strengthened the minds of the weak, for as it has been said, this
favor could have hardly been tasted by the Jews while in a state so despairing.
The Prophet then made use of a homely and ordinary style when he spoke of flocks
and herds. It now follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah now shews why God had promised that there
would be a quiet </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>habitation for
shepherds</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>so that no one would by force
take away<i> </i>their flocks. For God declares, that his promise would not be
void, as its effects would shortly be evident, even when his mercy was known by
the ten tribes and by the kingdom of Judah. Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The days shall
come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for it behoved the faithful to
look farther than to their present condition. As they were then exposed to
slaughter, though the unbelieving still entertained vain hopes, yet the children
of God saw thousand deaths; so that it could not be but that terror almost drove
them to despair; and in their exile they saw that they were far removed from
their own country, without any hope of a return. That the Prophet then might
still support these, he bids them to extend their thoughts to a future time; and
he had prefixed, as we have before seen, seventy years. It is the same then as
though he had said, that the favor of which he predicts could not be laid hold
on, except the faithful held their minds in suspense, and patiently waited until
the time of the promised deliverance came.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Coming
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>are the days, and I will

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;wq</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>kum, </i>means to rise, but here in an active or transitive sense it means to
make to rise. However, its meaning sometimes is to establish, and sometimes to
rouse,</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF90</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
so as to make that to appear which was before hidden. And this mode of speaking
is fitly adopted as to the promises of God; for they seem for a time to he
dormant without any effect, or seem to disappear or vanish away. Hence the
stability of the promises then appears, and is seen when God raises them up,
they being before hidden and concealed from the faithful. The meaning of the
Prophet is, that God would at length render evident the power of his word, by
fulfilling it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But from this manner of speaking, a useful doctrine
may be deduced: for we are thus reminded that the promises of God are not always
so manifest, that their effect or accomplishment is evident to us, but on the
contrary they may appear to be dead and void. When it is so, let us learn to
exercise faith and patience, so that our souls may not tremble, though
God&#8217;s promises may not every moment manifest their power by being actually
fulfilled. In short, the true application of prophetic truth is, that we never
lay hold on, and really embrace the promises of God, except we look forward to
the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>days that are
coming</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, except we patiently
wait for the time prefixed by God: and further, except our faith leans on the
promises, when they seem to he dormant, it is not firm, and has no roots or
foundations; for as the root which nourishes the tree is not seen, but lies hid
in the earth, and as the foundation of a house is not visible to our eyes,<i>
</i>so ought our faith to be in like manner founded, and to drive deep roots
into God&#8217;s promises, so that its firmness may not be in the air, nor have
a visible surface, but a hidden foundation. This then is the import and the
proper application of this doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But God calls it his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good
word</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because he had promised to be the
deliverer of his people. The word of God, when it denounces all kinds of death,
and contains nothing but terrors, is always good, if goodness be taken for what
is just and right; and hence God, by Ezekiel, reproves the Jews, because his
word was bitter to them, and says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Are the ways of
the Lord crooked and thorny? Ye are awry,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and<i> </i>not
my word.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;261825&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ezekiel
18:25)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here the goodness of the word is to be taken for
the deliverance of the people; for when God shakes the despisers of his Law with
terror, his word is called evil on account of its effect. At the same time, as I
have already said, whether God offers to us his favor and mercy, or denounces
vengeance on the unbelieving, his word is ever good and right, though it may not
be pleasant. This then relates to the apprehensions of men when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
rouse</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or establish,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>my good
word</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which I have
spoken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;&#8217;</i>by which clause he
confirms the doctrine of Jeremiah, for he shews that he was its author, and that
Jeremiah brought nothing from himself, but faithfully testified of his mercy and
of the liberation of the people according to the commission he had received. We
are at the same time reminded, that we are not presumptuously to hope for
anything, except God has spoken. Let us then learn to embrace his promises, so
that none of us may look for this or that, but know that then only he will be
propitious to us, when we lean on his word. He afterwards speaks of the kingdom
of Israel, and of the kingdom of Judah, to intimate that he would be merciful to
the whole people, though the ten tribes had been for a long time separated from
the tribe of Judah, and from the half tribe of Benjamin, as it has been stated
elsewhere. It follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet shews what Paul afterwards has
spoken of, that all the promises of God are in Christ yea and amen,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470120&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 1:20) that is, that they do not stand nor can be valid as to us,
except Christ interposes to sanction or confirm them. Then the efficacy of
God&#8217;s promises depends on Christ alone. And hence the Prophets, when
speaking of the grace of God, come at length to Christ, for without him all the
promises would vanish away. Let us also know that the Jews had been so trained
as ever to flee to God&#8217;s covenant; for on the general covenant depended
all particular promises. As, for instance, Jeremiah has hitherto been often
prophesying of God&#8217;s mercy to the people, after having punished them for
their sins; now this promise was special. How then could the Jews and the
Israelites believe that they should return to their own country? This special
promise could have been of no moment, except as it was an appendix of the
covenant, even because God had adopted them as his people. As then the Jews knew
that they had been chosen as a peculiar people, and that God was their Father,
hence their faith in all the promises. Now, again, we must bear in mind, that
the covenant was founded on Christ alone; for God had not only promised to
Abraham that he would be a Father to his seed, but had also added an earnest or
a pledge that a Redeemer would come.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive the reason why the Prophets,
when they sought to strengthen the faithful in the hope of salvation, set forth
Christ, because the promises had no certainty without the general covenant. And
further, as the general covenant could not stand, nor have any validity, except
in Christ, this is the point to which Jeremiah now turns his attention, as we
have also seen in other places, especially in the twenty-third chapter, from
which he repeats this prophecy. God then had promised that his people would be
restored; he had also promised that he would be so propitious to them as to
preserve them in safety as his people: he now adds &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In those days, and at that time, I
will raise up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>I will cause to
germinate; the verb in the twenty-third chapter is
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ytmqh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>ekamti, </i>I will cause to rise; but here, &#8220;I<i> </i>will cause to
germinate;&#8221; and there we read, &#8220;a righteous branch,&#8221; but here,
&#8220;a<i> </i>branch of righteousness,&#8221; which means the same thing. But
why does the Prophet now speak of the seed of David? It is not an abrupt
sentence; and the reason is, because the minds of the faithful would have alwass
vacillated, had not Christ been brought forward, on whom the eternal and
unchangeable covenant of God was founded. But they could not have had any taste
of God&#8217;s grace, had they not known that they had been gratuitously chosen
by him. Adoption then was the foundation of the covenant; and then Christ was
the earnest and pledge of the covenant, as well as of gratuitous adoption. Hence
it was, that the Prophet, wishing to seal and confirm his prophecy, bids the
faithful to look to Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In those days, and at that
time</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for, as it is said in the proverb,
&#8220;Even quickness is delay when we have ardent wishes,&#8221; so now a long
delay might have produced weariness iu the Israelites. That they might not,
then, be carried away by too much haste, he mentions
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>those days
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that
time</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>So that if God deferred the time,
that they might check themselves, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will make to grow for David a
righteous branch</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage ought, no doubt, to be understood of
Christ. We know that it was a common thing with the Jews, that whenever the
Prophets promised to them the seed of David, to direct their attention to
Christ. This was then a mode of teaching familiarly known to the Jews. The
Prophets, indeed, sometimes mentioned David himself, and not his
son,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I will raise up
David,&#8221; etc.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;263423&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ezekiel
34:23)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now David was dead, and his body was reduced to dust
and ashes; but under the person of David, the Prophets exhibited Christ. Then as
to this passage, the Jews must shew their effrontery in a most ridiculous
manner, if they make evasions and attempt to apply it otherwise than to Christ.
This being the ease, were any one to ask now the Jews, how this prophecy has
been fulfilled, it would be necessary for them to acknowledge Christ, or to deny
faith in God, and also in Jeremiah. It is, indeed, certain that Jeremiah
celebrates here the grace of deliverance especially on this account, because a
Redeemer was shortly to come. For the return of the Jews to their own land, what
was it? We know that they, even immediately at their restoration, were in a
miserable state, though their condition then was much better than afterwards;
for in after times they were cruelly treated by Antiochus and other kings of
Syria: they were ever exposed to the heathens around them, so that they were
harassed and plundered by them at pleasure. Then during the whole of that time
which preceded the coming of Christ, God did not fulfill what he had promised by
Jeremiah and his other servants. What is now their condition? Dispersed through
the whole world; and they have been so for more than fifteen hundred years,
since Christ arose from the dead; and we see that they pine away under their
calamities, so their curse seems dreadful to all. God had, indeed, spoken by
Moses, and then repeated it by his Prophets,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Ye shall be for a
hissing and for a curse to all nations.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;052837&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
28:37;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242518&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
25:18)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But that punishment was to be for a time. There is,
therefore, no reason for what the Jews allege. It hence appears that they are
wholly destitute of all credit, and only perversely pretend, I know not what,
that there may be some show, though wholly hypocritical, in what they assert.
But with regard to us, we see that the promise respecting the coming of the
Messiah has not been made in vain; and we also know, that it happened, through
the wonderful purpose of God, that the Jews did not enjoy full and real
happiness, such as had been promised at the coming of Christ, lest they should
think that what all God&#8217;s servants had promised was then accomplished: for
we know how disposed men are to be satisfied with earthly things. The Jews might
then have thought that their happiness was completed, had not God exercised them
with many troubles, in order that they might ever look forward to the
manifestation of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Branch of
righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>by way of contrast,
because the children of David had become degenerated; and God had almost deemed
them accursed, for the greatest part of the kings were destitute of God&#8217;s
grace. There was, then, but one Branch of righteousness, even Christ. We further
know how wide and extensive is Christ&#8217;s righteousness, for he communicates
it to us. But we ought to begin with that righteousness which I have mentioned,
that is, what is in opposition to the many changes which happened to the
posterity of David, for things often were in a very low state.
Though</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> unto
David</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dwdl</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
Ladavid, </i>is often taken as meaning, &#8220;I<i> </i>will raise up the branch
of David,&#8221; yet God seems here to refer to the promise which he had made to
David, as God is said in many passages to have sworn to his servant David.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;198903&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
89:3; 132:11)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he shall execute judgement
and justice in the land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By these words
a right government is denoted; for when the two words are joined tegether,
justice refers to the defense of the innocent, and judgment to the punishment of
iniquity; for except the wicked are restrained by the fear of the law, they
would violate all order. Judgment, indeed, when by itself, means the right
administration of the law; but as I have already said, justice and judgment
include the protection of the good, and also the restraint of the wicked, who
become not obedient willingly or of their own accord. In a word, the promise is,
that the king here spoken of would be upright and just, so as to be in every way
perfect, and exhibit the model of the best of kings.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must always observe the contrast between the
other descendants of David and Christ. For the Jews had seen the saddest
spectacles in the posterity of David: many of them were apostates, and perverted
the worship of God; others raged against the Prophets and all good men, and were
also full of avarice and rapacity, and given to all kinds of lusts. Since, then,
their kings had debased themselves with so many crimes, there is here promised a
king who would so discharge his office as to be owned as the true minister of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is, at the same time, necessary to bear in mind
the character of Christ&#8217;s kingdom. It is, we know, spiritual; but it is
set forth under the image or form of an earthly and civil government; for
whenever the Prophets speak of Christ&#8217;s kingdom, they set before us an
earthly form, because spiritual truth, without any metaphor, could not have been
sufficiently understood by a rude people in their childhood. There is no wonder,
then, that the Prophets, wishing to accommodate their words to the capacity of
the Jews, should so speak of Christ&#8217;s kingdom as to portray it before them
as an earthly and civil government. But it is necessary for us to consider what
sort of kingdom it is. As, then, it is spiritual, the justice and judgment of
which the Prophet speaks, do not belong only to civil and external order, but
rather to that rectitude by which it comes that men are reformed according to
God&#8217;s image, which is in righteousness and truth. Christ then is said to
reign over us in justice and judgment, not only because he keeps us by laws
within the range of our duty, and defends the good and the innocent, and
represses the audacity of the wicked; but because he rules us by his Spirit. And
of the Spirit we know what Christ himself declares, &#8220;The Spirit shall
convince the world of righteousness and judgment,&#8221; etc.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431608&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
16:8) Hence we must come to spiritual jurisdiction, if we wish to understand
what that righteousness is which is here mentioned: of the same kind also is the
judgment that is added. It afterwards follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet extends the benefits of the kingdom
to all the Jews, and shews how much was to be expected fromthat kingdom which he
had promised; for in it would be found perfect happiness and safety. Had not
this been added, what we have heard of the righteous king would have appeared
cold and uninteresting; for it sometimes happens, that however much the king may
exercise justice and judgment, yet the people continue still miserable. But the
Prophet testifies here that the people would be in every way blessed and happy,
when governed by the King promised to come. Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In those days Judah shall be
saved</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He promises salvation to the
Jews, though under that name are included also, as it is often the case, the ten
tribes. He adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>but in a similar sense,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jerusalem shall dwell
safely</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, shall be in a peaceable
state. This mode of speaking is taken from Moses; for the Prophets, whenever
they spoke of God&#8217;s blessings, are wont to borrow their doctrine from that
fountain. He then says, that the people would be saved, and then that they would
be in peace and quietness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may now be proper to repeat what I have already
touched upon, &#8212; that the salvation mentioned here belongs to the kingdom
of Christ. Had he been speaking of some earthly or temporal government, the
salvation must also have been temporal. But as the spiritual and celestial
kingdom of Christ is the object of the promise, the salvation mentioned must
reach to the very heavens. Hence its limits are far wider than the whole world.
In short, the salvation of which Jeremiah now prophesies, is not to be confined
to the boundaries of a fading life, nor is it to be sought in this world, where
it has no standing; but if we wish to know what it is, we must learn to raise
our thoughts upwards, and above the world and everything that exists here. It is
an eternal salvation. In the meantime, Christ gives us some foretaste of this
salvation in this life, according to what is said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;godliness has the
promises of the present as well</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">as
of the future life.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540408&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Timothy 4:8)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as this promise ought to be applied to the
kingdom of Christ, there is no doubt but it is perpetual, and ought to raise up
our thoughts to heaven itself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To salvation is added <i>safety; </i>for were the
faithful ever to fear and tremble, where would be their salvation? And we know
that the happiness brought to us by Christ cannot be otherwise received, except
through peace, according to what Scripture so often teaches us:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Having been
justified,&#8221; says Paul, &#8220;we have peace with God.&#8221; (Romans
5:l)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And then when he speaks in the fourteenth chapter of
the same Epistle of the kingdom of God, he says that it consists in joy and
peace; and in another place he says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;May the peace of
God, which surpasses all conception, obtain the victory in your hearts.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;500407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Philippians
4:7)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence these things are connected together, salvation
and peace, not that we enjoy this joyful and peaceful state in the world; for
they greatly deceive themselves who dream of such a quiet state here, as we have
to engage in a perpetual warfare, until God at length gathers us to the fruition
of a blessed rest. We<i> </i>must, therefore, contend and fight in this world.
Thus the faithful shall ever be exposed to many troubles; and hence Christ
reminds his disciples, &#8220;In me ye have peace; but in theworld&#8221;
&#8212; what? Sorrows and troubles.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431633&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
16:33)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, see why the Prophet joined safety or
security to salvation, even because we cannot otherwise know that we shall be
saved, except we be fully persuaded that God so cares for our salvation as to
protect us by his power, and that his aid will be always ready whenever
needed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He in the last place adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And this is the name by which
they shall call her, Jehovah our
righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In chapter 23 (Jeremiah
23) this name is given to Christ, and to him alone it properly belongs; but it
is here transferred to the Church, for whatever belongs to the head, is made
common to all the members. For we indeed know that Christ has nothing as his
own, for as he is made righteousness, it belongs to us, according to what Paul
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;He is made to us
righteousness, and redemption, and sanctification, and wisdom.&#8221; (1
Corinthians 1:30)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, then, the Father conferred righteousness on his
own Son for our sake, it is no wonder that what is in his power is transferred
to us. What, then, we found in the twenty-third chapter was rightly declared,
for it belongs peculiarly to Christ, that he is God our righteousness. But as we
partake of this righteousness, when he admits us into a participation of all the
blessings by which he is adorned and enriched by the Father, it hence follows,
that this also belongs to the whole Church, even that God is its
righteousness.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF91</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence it is wisely said by the Prophet,
that this would be the name of the whole Church, which could not be, except it
had put on Christ, so that God might reign there in righteousness, for the
righteousness of Christ extends to all<b> </b>the faithful; and Christ also
dwells in them, so that they are not only the temples of Christ, but, as it
were, a part of him; and even the Church itself is by Paul called
Christ,</font><br></div>

priesthood would be perpetual. The safety of the people, as it is well known,
was secured<i> </i>by these two things; for without a king they were like an
imperfect or a maimed body, and without a priesthood there was nothing but ruin;
for the priest was, as it were, the mediator between God and the people, and the
king represented God. We now, then, perceive the object of the Prophet, why he
speaks expressly here of the kingdom and the priesthood, for the people could
not otherwise have any ground to stand on. He therefore declares that the
condition of the people would be safe, because there would always be some of the
posterity of David, who would succeed<i> </i>to govern them, and there would
always be some of the posterity of Levi, to offer sacrifices.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this passage ought to be carefully noticed, for
we hence<i> </i>gather, that though all other things were given to us according
to our wishes, we should yet be ever miserable, except we had Christ as our
head, to perform the office<i> </i>of a king and of a priest. This, then, is the
only true happiness of the Church, even to be in subjection to Christ, so that
he may exercise towards us the two offices described here. Hence also we gather,
that these are the two marks of a true Church, by which she is to be
distinguished from all conventicles,<i> </i>who falsely profess the name of God,
and boast themselves to be Churches. For where the kingdom and priesthood of
Christ are found, there, no doubt, is the Church; but where Christ is not owned
as a king and a priest, nothing is there but confusion, as under the Papacy; for
though they pretend the name of Christ, yet, as they do not submit to his
government and laws, nor are satisfied with his priesthood, but have devised for
themselves numberless patrons and advocates, it is quite evident that,
notwithstanding the great splendor of the Papacy, it is nothing but an
abomination before God. Let us, then, learn to begin with the kingdom and the
priesthood, when we speak of the state and government of the
Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now we know that in David was promised a spiritual
kingdom, for what was David but a type of Christ? As God then gave in David a
living image of his only-begotten Son, we ought ever to pass from the temporal
kingdom to the eternal, from the visible to the spiritual, from the earthly to
the celestial. The same thing ought to be said of the priesthood; for no mortal
can reconcile God to men, and make an atonement for sins; and further, the blood
of bulls and of goats could not pacify the wrath of God, nor incense, nor the
sprinkling of,water, nor any of the things which belonged to the ceremonial
laws; they could not, give the hope of salvation, so as to quiet trembling
consciences.<i> </i>It then follows, that that priesthood was shadowy, and that
the Levites represented Christ until he came.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet here speaks according to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>circumstances
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of his own time, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cut off shall not be from David a
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>who may
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sit on the throne of the house of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cut off shall not be from the
priests, the Levites, a man </i></font><font face="Palatino">who may
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>kindle burnt-offerings burn an
oblation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>etc.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF92</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Why does he not speak in general of the
whole people? Why does he not promise that the twelve tribes would be saved? for
this would be, a matter of greater moment. But as we have said, we ought to
understand this principle, that every kind of blessing is included here, so that
men are always in a miserable state unless they are ruled by Christ and have him
as their priest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be asked here, how does this prophecy
agree with facts? for from the time Jeremiah promised such a state of things,
there has been no successor to David. It is true, indeed, that Zerubbabel was a
leader among the people, but he was without a royal title or dignity. There was
no throne, no crown, no scepter, from the time in which the people returned from
their Babylonian exile; and yet God testified by the mouth of Jeremiah that
there would be those from the posterity of David, who would govern the people in
continual succession. He does not stay that they would be chiefs or leaders, but
he adorns them with a royal title. Some one, he says, will ever remain to occupy
the throne. I have said already that there has been no throne. But we must bear
in mind what Ezekiel says, that an interruption as to the kingdom is not
contrary to this prophecy, as to the perpetuity of the kingdom, or continued
succession,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;262127&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
21:27) for he prophesied that the crown would be cast down, until the legitimate
successor of David came.<i> </i>It was therefore necessary that the diadem
should fall and be cast on the ground, or be transverted, as the Prophet says,
until Christ was manifested. As, then, this had been declared, now when our
Prophet speaks of kings succeeding David, we must so understand what he says as
that that should remain true which has been said of the cast down diadem. God,
then, did cast down the diadem until the legitimate successor came. Ezekiel does
not only say, &#8220;Cast<i> </i>ye it down transverted,&#8221; but he repeats
the words three times, intimating thereby that the interruption would be long.
There was, therefore, no cause of stumbling, when there was no kind of
government, nor dignity, nor power; for it was necessary to look forward to the
king, to whom the diadem, or the royal crown, was to be
restored.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see how it was that there have been
always those of David&#8217;s posterity who occupied the throne; though this was
hidden, yet it may be gathered from other prophetic testimonies. For Amos, when
he speaks of Christ&#8217;s coming, makes this announcement,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;There shall come
at that time one who will repair the ruins of the tabernacle of David.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;300911&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Amos
9:11)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was therefore necessary that the kingdom should
be, as it were, demolished when Christ appeared. We further know what Isaiah
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Come<i> </i>forth
shall a shoot from the root of Jesse.&#8221; (Isaiah 11:l)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He does not there name David, but a private person,
who was content with a humble, retired, and rustic life; for a husbandman and a
shepherd, as it is well known, was Jesse<i> </i>the father of David. In short,
whenever the Prophets declare that the kingdom of David would be perpetual, they
do not promise that there would be a succession without interruption; but this
ought to be referred to that perpetuity which was at length manifested in Christ
alone. We have said elsewhere, how the time of return ought to be connected with
the coming of Christ. For it is not necessary nor expedient to introduce an
anagogical sense, as interpreters are wont to do, by representing the return of
the people as symbolical of what was higher, even of the deliverance which was
effected by Christ; for it ought to be considered as one and the same favor of
God, that is, that he brought back his people from exile, that they might at
length enjoy quiet and solid happiness when the kingdom of David should again be
established.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the priesthood, the same difficulty might be
raised, for we know that the priesthood became corrupted; nay, that for the most
part the priests not only became degenerate, but altogether sacrilegious. Hence
the sacerdotal name itself became nothing else but a base and wicked profanation
of all sacred things. But it was God&#8217;s purpose in this manner to shew that
another priest was to be expected, and that men were not to look on figures and
types, but were to raise their thoughts higher, even to him who was to be the
only true Mediator to reconcile God to men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who may kindle a
burnt-offering</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc., he specifies
certain things, or some parts of the priest&#8217;s office, because the Prophets
accommodated their discourses to men of their own age and time, and described
the kingdom and priesthood of Christ under those external symbols, which were
then in use. It is hence proper to take the ceremonies of the Law as denoting
the reality, or what they signified. For Christ offered no calves, nor any
incense, but fulfilled all these things which were then set forth to the people
under symbols. And he speaks of <i>burning, </i>or perfuming the <i>oblation,
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hjnm</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
meneche, </i>for though the oblation remained entire, there was yet a perfuming
made by frankincense, and a small portion of the flour was burnt. It is then a
mode of speaking, when a part is stated for the whole. It now follows &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms the same thing, but by introducing a
similitude; for he shews that God&#8217;s covenant with the people of Israel
would not be less firm than the settled order of nature. Unceasing are the
progresses of the sun, moon, and stars; continual is the succession of day and
night. This settled state of things is so fixed, that in so great and so
multiplied a variety there is no change. We have now rain, then fair weather,
and we have various changes in the seasons; but the sun still continues its
daily course, the moon is new every month, and the revolving of day and night,
which God has appointed, never ceases; and this unbroken order declares, as it
is said in Psalm 19, the wonderful wisdom of God. The Prophet then sets before
us here the order of nature, and says, that God&#8217;s covenant with his Church
shall be no less fixed and unchangeable than what it is with mankind, with
regard to the government of the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive the purpose of the Prophet in saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If void ye can make my covenant
respecting the day and the night, then abolished shall be my covenant with David
and the Levites</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Now he indirectly
touches on the wickedness of the people; for the Jews did, as far as they could,
overthrow, by their murmurs and complaints, the covenant of God; for in their
adversities they instantly entertained the thought and also expressed it, that
God had forgotten his covenant. This want of faith then is intimated by the
Prophet, as though he had said, &#8220;Why are these complaints? It is the same
thing as though ye sought to pull down the sun and the moon from the heavens,
and to subvert the difference between day and night, and to upset the whole
order of nature; for I am the same God, who has settled the succession of day
and night, and has promised that the Church shall continue for ever: ye can,
therefore, no more abolish my covenant with David than the general law of
nature.&#8221; We now then understand the Prophet&#8217;s object: for this was
not said without conveying reproof; because they were very wicked and ungrateful
to God, when they doubted his truth and constancy, respecting the promise as to
the perpetual condition of the Church. He in short intimates that they were
carried away, as it were, by a blind madness, when they thus hesitated to
believe God&#8217;s covenant, as though they attempted to subvert the whole
world, so that there should be no longer any difference between light and
darkness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall be abolished my
covenant with David my servant, that he should not be my
son</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. He repeats what he had said,
even that it could not be but that the posterity of David should obtain the
kingdom, which we know has been fulfilled in Christ. <i>The throne </i>of David
he now calls what he had named before as the throne of the house of Israel; but
he means the same thing. It is called the throne of the house of Israel, because
the king and the people are relatively connected,<i> </i>and also because the
posterity of David ruled for the public good, not for their own

to him, &#8220;Number the stars, if thou canst, and the sands of the sea, so
shall thy seed be.&#8221; We hence see that this blessing was extended to the
whole seed of Abraham, and especially to the twelve tribes. And now it is
confined to the family of David, and to the Levitical tribe.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what we have already touched upon ought to be
borne in mind, &#8212; that the safety of the people was grounded on the kingdom
and the priesthood. As then kings ruled not for themselves, nor had the
sacerdotal dignity been given to the Levites for their own private advantage,
but for the sake of the people, so now the Prophet, stating a part for the
whole, intimates that the whole people would be secure and safe, when the royal
and sacerdotal dignity flourished. There is not, then, anything diminished from
God&#8217;s promise, as though the other tribes were not to multiply; but what
Jeremiah testifies respecting the family of David and the Levitical tribe, is to
be extended, without any difference, to the whole Church. It is yet not without
reason that an especial mention is made of David and Levi; for, as it has been
said, the Church must have been in a miserable state, without a head, and
without a Mediator. There is, however, no doubt but that Jeremiah alluded to
that passage which we have already quoted,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;011505&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
15:5;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450418&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
4:18) and thus he reproved the want of faith in the people; for they could not
have doubted the restoration of the Church without impugning the truth of God,
as though he had given only vain words to Abraham, when he
said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Number the stars
of heaven if thou canst, and the sands of the sea, so shall thy seed
be.&#8221;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He now assigns a reason why he had so largely spoken
of the deliverance of the people and of their perpetual preservation, even
because the blessing promised by God was regarded as uncertain by the
unbelieving. Farther, God not only reminds his Prophet why he bade him to repeat
so often the same thing, but speaks also for the sake of the people, in order
that they might know that this repetition was not in vain, as it was necessary
to contend against their perverse wickedness; for they had so filled their minds

no place to faith or hope.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There are some who explain this passage of the

cold and unmeaning. I have no doubt but that God here expostulates with the

been divided into two parts; for they ought to have been one nation. But though
it had happened through the defection of the ten tribes that the body of the

speaking, says, that the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>two

might be one: for as there is but one head, so there ought to be but one body.
But God had not wholly cast away the ten tribes, though they had wickedly and
impiously revolted from the family of David. He then says, according to the
language which prevailed, that the

said, that both were rejected, which was true, but not in the sense they
intended; for as it has been before said, they thought that there was no hope
remaining, as though the covenant of God had been wholly abolished, while yet
the rejection was only for a time.</font><br></div>

promises, when they saw that they were to go into exile. For as before they had
hardened themselves against threatenings, so now despair immediately laid hold

<div><font face="Palatino">Here God opposes the constancy of his faithfulness to
their perverse murmurings, of which he had complained; and he again adduces the

that sacred covenant which I have made with my chosen

thing in itself sufficiently clear, even because the contest with the obstinate
hopelessness of the people was difficult. For they thought that they were

Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>he now fitly joins together what
might have seemed unconnected; for he says, that there would be always some of
David&#8217;s posterity to rule over all the tribes. God, therefore, thus
preserved his Church when he set a king over his Church; or a kingdom, as we
have said, is inseparable from the safety of the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He lastly adds,

of the people: for an objection was ready at hand, &#8220;What<i> </i>can this
mean? for the ten tribes have been already led away into distant regions, and
are scattered; a part also of the kingdom of Judah has been cut off; and what
remains is not far from entire ruin.&#8221; Hence God calls their attention to
the hope of deliverance, as though he had said, that they were acting foolishly,
because they were thus hasty, for their expectation ought to have remained in
suspense until the time prescribed, that is, till the end of the seventy years,
according to what we have before seen, when the Prophet spoke against impostors
who boasted of a quick return. He therefore tells them that they ought patiently
to bear their exile, until the full time of their deliverance came.<i> </i>And

<div><font face="Palatino">It is no wonder, nor ought it to be deemed useless,
that the Prophet so often repeats the same things, for we know how great was the
hardness of the people with whom he had to do. Here, then, he tells us that he
was sent to King Zedekiah when the city was besieged by Nebuchadnezzar and his
whole army. The Prophet mentions the circumstances, by which we may understand
how formidable that siege was, for Nebuchadnezzar had not brought a small force,
but had armed many and various people. Hence the Prophet here expressly mentions
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the kingdoms of the earth and the
nations who were, under his
dominion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Zedekiah was then the king at Jerusalem, and there
remained two other cities safe, as we shall hereafter see; but it is evident how
unequal he must have been to contend with an army so large and powerful.
Nebuchadnezzar was a monarch; the kingdom of Israel had been cut off, which far
exceeded in number the kingdom of Judah; and he had subdued all the neighboring
nations. Such a siege then ought to have immediately taken away from the Jews
every hope of deliverance; and yet the Prophet shews that the king was as yet
resolute, and there was still a greater obstinacy among the people. But Zedekiah
was not overbearing; we find that he was not so proud and so cruel as tyrants
are wont to be: as then he was not of a ferocious disposition, we hence see how
great must have been the pride of the whole people, and also their perverseness
against God, when they made the king to be so angry with the Prophet. Yet the
state of things as described ought to have subdued his passion; for as ungodly
men are elevated by prosperity, so they ought to be humbled when oppressed with
adversity. The king himself, as well as the people, were reduced to the greatest
extremities, and yet they would not be admonished by God&#8217;s Prophet; and
hence it is expressly said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;143616&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 36:16, that Zedekiah did not regard the word of the Prophet, though
he spoke from the mouth of the Lord, by whom he had been sent.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sum of this prophecy is as follows: &#8212; He
first says that the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>word was
given him by Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and secondly, he
points out the time, for what reason we have already stated. For if he had
reproved Zedekiah when there was peace and quietness, and when there was no fear
of danger, the king might have been easily excited, as it is usual, against the
Prophet. But when he saw the city surrounded on every side by so large and
powerful an army, &#8212; when he saw collected so many from the kingdoms of the
earth, &#8212; so many nations, that he could hardly muster up the thousandth
part of the force of his enemies,wthat he could not and would not,
notwithstanding all this, submit to God and acknowledge his vengeance just,
&#8212; this was an instance of extreme blindness, and a proof that he was
become as it were estranged in mind. But God had thus blinded him, because his
purpose was, as it is said elsewhere, to bring an extreme punishment on the
people. The blindness, then, and the madness of the king, was an evidence of
God&#8217;s wrath towards the whole people; for Zedekiah might have appeased God
if he had repented. It was then God&#8217;s will that he should have been of an
intractable disposition, in order that he might by such perverseness and
obstinacy bring on himself utter ruin.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He mentions
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nebuchadnezzar
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his whole
army</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>he afterwards describes the army
more particularly, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with all the
kingdoms under his dominion, and all
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>When Jerusalem was in this
condition, the Prophet was sent to the king. The substance of the message
follows, even that the city was doomed to destruction, because God had resolved
to deliver it into the hand of the enemy. This was a very sad message to
Zedekiah. Hypocrites, we know, seek flatteries in their calamities; while God
spares them they will not bear to be reproved, and they reject wise counsels,
and even become exasperated when God&#8217;s Prophets exhort them to repent. But
when God begins to smite them, they wish all to partake of their misfortunes;
and then also they accuse God&#8217;s servants of cruelty, as though they
insulted their misery by setting their sins before them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is what we are taught by daily experience. When
any one of the common people, at the time when God does not chasten them either
by disease or poverty, or any other adversity, is admonished, the petulant
answer is, &#8220;What do you mean? in what respect am I worthy of blame? I am
conscious of no evil.&#8221; Thus hypocrites boast as long as God bears with
them, and though his kindness spares them. But when any adversity happens to
them, when any one is laid on his bed, when another is bereaved of a son or a
wife, or in any way visited with afltietion, &#8212; if then God&#8217;s
judgment is set before them, they think that a grievous wrong is done to them:
&#8220;What! have I not evils enough without any addition? I expected comfort
from God&#8217;s servants, but they exaggerate my calamities.&#8221; In short,
hypocrites are never in a fit condition to receive God&#8217;s
reproofs.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is then no doubt but that Jeremiah knew that
his message would be intolerable to King Zedekiah, and to his people. However,
he boldly declared, as we shall see, what God had committed to him. And we
further perceive how stupid and hardened Zedekiah must have been, for he
hesitated not to cast God&#8217;s Prophet into prison, even at the time when
things were come into extremity. It was the same thing as though God with a
stretched out arm and a drawn sword had shewn himself to be his enemy; yet he
ceased not to manifest his rage against God; and as he could do nothing worse,
he cast God&#8217;s servant into prison; and though he did this, not so much
through the impulse of his own mind as that of others, he yet could not have
been excused from blame.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I will deliver this city
into the hand of the king of Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Had he simply said that the city would in a short time be taken, it would
have been a general truth, not effectual but frigid. It was therefore necessary
to add this, &#8212; that the ruin of the city<i> </i>was a just punishment
inflicted by God. And Zedekiah was also thus reminded, that though he were
stronger than his enemy, yet he could not effectually resist him, for the war
was carrid on under the authority of God, as though he had said, &#8220;Thou
thinkest that thou contendest with men; it would be difficult enough for thee
and more than enough, to contend with the eastern monarchy and so many nations
and kingdoms; farther than this, God himself is thine enemy; have regard to him,
that thou mayest learn to dread his judgment.&#8221; And that the words might be
more forcible, God himself speaks in his own person,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will deliver this
city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with
fire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This last sentence was a dreadful
aggravation; for it often happens that cities are taken, and the conquerors are
satisfied with the spoils. When, therefore, Nebuchadnezzar came against the city
of Jerusalem with so much rage that he burnt it, it was a proof of the dreadful
vengeance of God. It now follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">As Zedekiah saw the people still doing their duty he
despised his enemy; for as the city was very strongly fortified, he hoped to be
able to preserve it a little time longer. Hence was the false hope of
deliverance; for he thought that the enemy being wearied would return into
Chaldea. He was deceived by this expectation. But the Prophet forthwith assailed
him, and declared that he would become a captive, which Zedekiah indeed deserved
through his ingratitude: for Nebuchadnezzar had put hint in the place of his
nephew, when Jeconiah was led away into Babylon and had made him king. He
afterwards revolted from the king of Babylon, to whom he had pledged his faith,
and to whom he became tributary. But the Prophet did not regard these
intermediate causes, but the primary cause, the fountain, even because the
people had not ceased to add sins to sins, because they had been wholly
untameable and had rejected all promises, and had also closed their ears against
all wise counsels. Then God, resolving to inflict extreme punishment on a people
so perverse and desperate, blinded their king, as we have before said, so that
he revolted from the king of Babylon, and thus brought destruction on himself,
and the city, and the whole country. Thus God overruled the intermediate causes
which are apparent to us; but he had his hidden purpose which he executed
through external means.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt not be freed from his
hand, for thou shalt be taken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and then
he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt be delivered
into his hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>What he says in many
words might have been expressed in one sentence: but it was necessary to rouse
the king&#8217;s sottishness, by which he was inebriated, so that he might be
awakened in order that he might dread the punishment which was at hand, which,
however, was not the case; but he was thereby rendered more inexcusable. Thus
the threatenings which God repeats by his servants are never useless; for if the
ears of those who are reproved are deaf, yet what God declares<i> </i>will be a
testimony against them, so that every excuse on the ground of ignorance is
removed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says afterwards,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thine eyes shall see the eyes of
the king of Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And this happened;
but his eyes were afterwards pulled out. He met, indeed, with singular disgrace,
for he was taken to Riblah and tried as a criminal. He was not treated as a
king, nor did he retain any of his former dignity; but he was taken before the
tribunal of the king of Babylon as a thief or a miscreant. Then after he was
convicted of ingratitude and treachery, the Chaldean king ordered his children
to be slain before his eyes, and also his chief men and counsellors, and himself
to be bound with chains and his eyes to be pulled out; and he brought him to
Babylon. It was, then, a most cruel punishment which the king of Babylon
inflicted on Zedekiah. And the Prophet seems to have indirectly referred to what
happened, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thine
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall see the eyes of the king of
Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>he was forced to look with his
eyes on the proud conqueror, and then his eyes were pulled out; but he had first
seen his own children slain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and his mouth shall speak to thy
mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, &#8220;Thou<i> </i>shalt
hear the dreadful sentence pronounced upon thee, after thou shalt be convicted
of a capital offense; the king himself shall degrade thee with all possible
disgrace.&#8221; Now, this was a harder fate than if Zedekiah had been secretly
put to death. He was dragged into the light; he then underwent many terrible
things when led into the presence of his enemy. This, then, the Prophet related,
that Zedekiah might understand that he in vain defended the city, for its
miserable end was near at hand. He afterwards adds, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Jeremiah adds some comfort, even that Zedekiah
himself would not be slain by the sword, but that he would die in his bed, and,
as they commonly say, yield to his fate. It was indeed some mitigation of
punishment, that God extended his life and suffered him not to be immediately
smitten with the sword. And yet if we consider all circumstances, it would have
been a lighter evil at once to be put to death, than to prolong life on the
condition of being doomed to pine away in constant misery. When the eyes are
pulled out, we know that the principal part of life is lost. When, therefore,
this punishment was inflicted on Zedekiah, was not death desirable? And then he
was not only deprived of his royal dignity, but was bereaved also of all his
offspring, and was afterwards bound with chains. We hence see that what remained
to him was not so much an object of desire, he might have preferred ten times or
a hundred times to die. God, however, designed it as a favor, that he was not
smitten with the sword.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A question may be here raised, Ought violent death to
be so much dreaded? We indeed know that some heathens have wished it. They tell
us of Julius Caesar, that the day before he was killed, he disputed at supper
what death was the best, and that he deemed it the easiest death
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eujqanasi&gt;an</font><font face="Palatino">)<i>
</i>when one is suddenly deprived of life, &#8212; the very thing which happened
to him the day after. Thus he seemed to have gained his wish, for he had said,
that it was a happy kind of death to be suddenly extinguished. There is,
however, no doubt but that natural death is always more easy to be borne, when
other things, as they say, are equal; for the feeling of nature is this, that
men always dread a bloody death, and it is regarded a monstrous thing when human
blood is shed; but when any one dies quietly through disease, as it is a common
thing, we do not feel so much horror. Then time is granted to the sick, to think
of God&#8217;s hand, to reflect on the hope of a better life, and also to flee
to God&#8217;s mercy, which cannot be done in a violent death. When, therefore,
all these are duly weighed, it ought not to be deemed strange, that God, willing
to mitigate the punishment of Zedekiah, should say,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shaft not die by the sword,
but thou shall die in peace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>To die in
peace is to die a natural death, when no violence is used, but when God hhnself
calls men, as though he stretched forth his hand to them. It is indeed certain,
that it is much better for some to be slain by the sword, than to pine away
through disease: for we see that many are either seized with frenzy on their
bed, or rage against God, or remain obstinate: there are, in short, dreadful
examples, which daily occur, where the Spirit of God does not work nor rule. For
there is then no tenderness in man, especially when he has the fear of death; he
then kindles up as it were into rage against God. But, on the other hand, many
who are brought into affliction, acknowledge themselves to be justly condemned,
and at the same time acknowledge the punishment inflicted to be medicine, in
order that they may obtain mercy before God. To many, then, it is better to die
a violent death than to die in peace; but this happens through the fault of men:
at the same time, natural death, as I have said, justly deserves to be much
preferred to a violent and bloody death, and I have briefly stated the reasons.
The subject might indeed be more fully handled, but it is enough to touch
shortly on the chief point as the passage requires.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shalt thou
die</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with the burninjs of thy fathers
shall they burn thee, and lament over thee, &#8220;Alas! Lord.&#8221;
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Here is added another comfort, &#8212; that
when Zedekiah should die, there would be some to bury him, not only in a humane,
but also in an honorable manner. And burial in many places is reckoned as one of
God&#8217;s favors, as in life God shews himself kind and bountiful to us when
we are in health and in vigor. For as health and food sufficient for the
necessities of life, are evidences of God&#8217;s love, so is burial after
death; for burial distinguishes men from brutes. When a wild beast dies, his
carcase is left to putrify. Why are men buried, except in hope of the
resurrection, as though they were laid up in a safe place till the time of
restoration? Burial, then, as it is a symbol of our immortality, makes a
distinction between us and brute animals after death. In death itself there is
no difference; the death of a man and the death of a dog, have no certain marks
to distinguish the one from the other. Then it is God&#8217;s will that there
should be some monument, that men might understand how nmch more excellent: is
their condition than that of brute animals. Hence then it is, that when God
favors us with a burial, he shows his paternal care towards us. On the contrary,
when the body of any one is cast away, it is in itself a sign of God&#8217;s
displeasure, as it appeared before, when the Prophet said of Jehoiakim that his
burial would be that of an ass,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
22:19) As then Jehoiakim was threatened with the burial of an ass, so now he
promises an honorable burial to Zedekiah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I said that this is true, when the thing is in itself
considered. For it sometimes happens that the most wicked are buried with honor
and great pomp, when the children of God are either burnt or torn by wild
beasts. Known is that complaint of the Psalmist, that the bodies of the saints
were cast away and became food to birds and wild beasts.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;197902&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
79:2) And it is said of the rich man, who lived in splendor, that he died and
was buried, but there is no mention made of the burial of Lazarus.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;421622&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
16:22) We ought not then simply to conclude, that those are miserable who are
not buried, and that those are blessed who obtain the honor of a burial. As the
sun is said to rise on the children of God and on strangers, so also after
death, as burial is a temporal benefit, it may be considered as belonging
indiscriminately to the good and to the bad. It may on the contrary be, that God
should deprive his children of a burial; yet still that truth remains fixed,
that burial in itself is an evidence of God&#8217;s favor; and that; when any
one is cast away and denied a burial, it is a sign of God&#8217;s displeasure.
When yet we come to individuals, the Lord turns a temporal punishment into a
benefit to his own people; and makes his temporal blessings to serve for a
heavier condemnation to all the reprobate and ungodly, hence they were barbarous
who dared to deride burial, as the Cynics did, who treated burial with contempt.
This was inhumanity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we ought to hold these points, &#8212; that as
God supplies us with bread, wine, and water, and other necessaries of life, in
order to feed us, and to preserve us in health and rigor, so we ought to regard
burial; but when the faithful are exposed to hunger, when they die through cold
or nakedness, or when they are made subject to other evils, and when they are
treated ignominiously after death, all this turns out for their salvation, for
the Lord regards their good even when he seems to afflict them with
adversities.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This, then, is the reason why the Prophet now in some
measure mitigates the sorrow of Zedekiah, by saying,.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall bury thee, and with
the burnings of thy fathers shall they burn
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This was not a common but a royal
mode of burial. He then promises, that after many degradations and reproaches,
God would at length shew him, when dead, some favor. But one may say,<i>
</i>what would this avail Zedekiah? for his body would then be without sense or
feeling. But. it was well to hear of this kindness of God, for he might thereby
conclude that God would be at length merciful to him, if he really humbled
himself. There is then no doubt but that a hope of pardon was promised to him,
though he was to be sharply and severely chastised even until he died. God then
intended that this symbol should ever be remembered by him, that he might not
wholly despair. We now then understand why the Prophet promised this to
Zedekiah, not that it might be a matter of interest to him to be buried with
honor, but that he might have some conception of God&#8217;s kindness and
mercy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now we know that the dead bodies of kings were burnt
at a great expense; many precious odors were procured, a fire was kindled, and
the bodies were seared; not that they were reduced to ashes, (for this was not
the custom, as among the Romans and other nations, who burnt the bodies of the
dead, and gathered the ashes) But among the Jews, the body was never burnt; only
they kindled a fire around the dead body, that putrefaction might not take
place. The bodies of the dead were dried by a slow fire. This was not indeed
commonly done, but only at the burials of kings, as it appears from the case of
Asa and of others.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;141614&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 16:14)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With the burnings of thy fathers
</i></font><font face="Palatino">shall they burn thee, and they shall lament
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thee, &#8220;Alas! Lord,&#8221;
</i></font><font face="Palatino">it may be asked, whether these lamentations
were approved by God? To this there is a ready answer, &#8212; that the Prophet
does not here commend immoderate mourning, and cryings, and ejaculations, when
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall lament
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>but that he took the expression
from what was commonly done, as though he had said, &#8220;They<i> </i>shall
perform for thee this office of humanity, such as is usually done over the
remains of kings in full power, in the day of their prosperity.&#8221; God,
then, in speaking here of lamentation and mourning, does not commend them as
virtues, or as worthy of praise, but refers only to what was then commonly done.
But we know what Paul especially teaches us, &#8212; that we are so to moderate
our sorrow, as not to be like the unbelieving, who have no hope,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;520413&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Thessalonians 4:13) for they think that death is the death of the soul as well
as of the body: they therefore lament their dead as for ever lost; and they also
murmur against God, and sometimes utter horrid blasphemies. Paul then would have
us to be moderate in our sorrow. He does not condemn sorrow altogether, but only
requires it to be moderate, so that we may shew what influence the hope of
resurrection has over us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And yet there is no doubt but that men, in this
respect, exceed moderation. It has commonly been the case almost in all ages to
be ostentatious in mourning for the dead. For not only are they without genuine
feeling in lamenting for their friends or relatives, but they are carried away
by a sort of ambition, while burying the dead with great noise and lamentation.
When they are alone they contain themselves, so that at least they make no
noise; but when they go out before others, they break forth into noisy
lamentations. It hence appears that, as I have said, mourning is often
ostentatious. But as men have from the beginning gone astray in this respect,
greater care ought to be taken by us, that each of us may check and restrain
himself. Still it is natural, as I have said, to weep for the dead; but
doubtless, it may be said, the ejaculations mentioned by the Prophet cannot be
approved; for to what purpose was it to cry, &#8220;Alas! Lord; our king is
dead,&#8221; and things of the same kind? But we ought to bear in mind, that
eastern nations were always excessive in this respect, and we find them to be so
at this day. The warmer the climate the more given to gestures and ceremonies
the people are. In these cold regions gesticulations and crying out,
&#8220;Alas! Lord, alas! father,&#8221; would be deemed impertinent and foolish.
But where they tear off their hair, and also cut themselves and tear their
cheeks not only with their nails, but also with knives, &#8212; where they do
these things, they also utter these ejaculations spoken of by the
Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, Almighty God,<i> </i>that as it
is ever expedient for us to be often chastised by thine hand, &#8212; O grant,

acknowledge our sins, that we may not at the same time doubt but that thou wilt
be merciful to us, and that we may with this confidence ever flee to seek
pardon, and that it may avail also to increase our repentance, so that we may
strive more and more to put off all the vices of the flesh, and to put on the
new man, so that thine image may be renewed in us, until we shall at length come
to partake of that eternal glory, which thou hast prepared in heaven for us,
through Christ thy Son. &#8212; Amen.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Jeremiah only relates that he had delivered the
message committed to him; and here is seen the Prophet&#8217;s magnanimity, for
as it appeared yesterday, he was an unwelcome messenger; and though there was
danger, yet Jeremiah performed his office, for he knew that God would not suffer
the king to do anything to him unless it were for some benefit. There is then no
doubt but that he deposited his life in God&#8217;s hand, and offered himself,
as it were, a sacrifice, when he dared openly to threaten the king, which could
not have been done without offending him; and</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;the<i> </i>wrath
of a king,&#8221; as Solomon
says,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;is the messenger of

<div><font face="Palatino">Here, then, the firmness of the Prophet is deserving
of praise; for he dreaded no danger when he saw that necessity was laid on him
by God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He again repeats that Jerusalem was then surrounded
by </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the army of the king of
Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as well as the other cities of
Judah, which he names, even <i>Lachish </i>and <i>Azekah. </i>He seems,
therefore, indirectly to reprove the arrogance of Zedekiah, for he still
retained his high spirits, when yet he was reduced to such straits. All the
cities of Judah, &#8212; how many were they? Two, says the Prophet. This, then,
was no unsuitable way of indirectly exposing to ridicule the vain confidence of
the king, who still thought that he could overcome the enemy, though he was
master only of three cities, that is, Jerusalem, Lachish, and Azekah. But the
Prophet gives a reason why these cities did not immediately fall into the hands
of the king of Babylon, because they were <i>fortified. </i>It hence follows,
that the other cities were taken without trouble, or that they surrendered of
their own accord. Zedekiah the king was then deprived of his power, and yet he
had not relinquished the ferocity of his mind, nor was he terrified by the
threatenings of the Prophet; and this was a proof of extreme madness. For he
hence appears that he was alienated in mind; for. the dreadful hand of God was
put forth against him, and yet he rushed headlong to his own ruin as a wild
beast destitute of reason. Let us proceed, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Though we do not read that what the Prophet relates
here was done by God&#8217;s command, yet we may easily gather that Zedekiah the
king had been admonished to liberate the servants according to the Law, as
written in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;022102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
21:2. It was God&#8217;s will that some difference should be between the people
he had adopted and other nations; for God had chosen the seed of Abraham as his
peculiar treasure, and other nations were in this respect aliens. It was
therefore his will to establish this law among the people of Israel, that
servitude should not be perpetual, except one bound himself willingly, of his
own accord, through his whole life, according to what we read in Deuteronomy
15:16,<i> </i>17; for when one of an ignoble mind deprived himself of the
benefit of this law, his master bored his ear with an awl; and having this mark,
he could no longer become free, except, perhaps, he lived to the jubilee year.
By the words of the Prophet we learn that this command of the Law had been
disregarded, for at the end of the seventh year the servants were not made free.
Hence the King Zedekiah, having been warned on the subject, called the people
together, and by the consent of all, liberty was proclaimed, according to what
God had commanded. But this was done in bad faith, for soon after the servants
were remanded, and thus treachery was added to cruelty. They had before unjustly
oppressed their brethren, but now perjury was heaped on wickedness. We hence see
that they not only wronged their own brethren, by imposing on them perpetual
servitude, but they also wickedly profaned the sacred name of God, having thus
violated a solemn oath.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, Jeremiah says that he was <i>sent </i>at the
time when, by a wicked perjury, the people began to oppress again their servants
and their maids. He therefore says, that the word of Jehovah came to him
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>after the covenant
</i></font><font face="Palatino">was made. A covenant he calls that solemn
agreement when God&#8217;s Law was revived, that servitude should not be
perpetual among the people of Israel. And he expresses the same thing when he
says, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a covenant was made
with all the people who were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some take &#8220;to them,&#8221;
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;hl</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>laem, </i>as referring to the servants and maids, but we may take it as
meaning </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>among
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>so that the Law should be in
force, not only for the present, but perpetually. Then follows what sort of
liberty it was to be, even </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that

<div><font face="Palatino">Here a question arises, Is perpetual servitude so
displeasing to God, that it ought not to be deemed lawful? To this the answer is
easy, &#8212; Abraham and other fathers had servants or slaves according to the
common and prevailing custom, and it was not deemed wrong in them. Before the
Law was given, there was nothing to forbid one who had servants or maids to
exercise power over them through life; and then the Law, mentioned here, was not
given indiscriminately and generally, but it was a peculiar privilege in favor
of the chosen people. Hence it is without reason that any one infers that it is
not lawful to exercise power over servants and maids; for, on the contrary, we
may reason thus, That since God permitted the fathers to remain servants and
maids, it is a thing lawful; and further, as God permitted the Jews also, under
the Law, to bear rule over aliens, and to keep them perpetually as servants, it
follows that this cannot be disapproved. And still a clearer evidence may be
adduced; for since the Gentiles have been called to the hope of salvation, no
change has in this respect been made. For the Apostles did not constrain masters
to liberate their servants, but only exhorted them to use kindness towards them,
and to treat them humanely as their fellow-servants.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
6:9;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
4:1) If, then, servitude were unlawful, the Apostles would have never tolerated
it; but they would have boldly denounced such a profane practice<i> </i>had it
been so. Now, as they commanded masters only to be humane towards their
servants, and not to treat them violently and reproachfully, it follows that
what was not denied was permitted, that is, to retain their own servants. We
also see that Paul sent back Onesimus to Philemon.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;570112&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philemon
1:12) Philemon was not only one of the faithful, but a pastor of the Church. He
ought, then, to have been an example to others. His servant had fled away from
him; Paul sent him back, and commended him to his master, and besought his
master to forgive his theft. We hence see that the thing in itself is not
unlawful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Our servitudes have been abolished, that is, that
miserable condition when one had no right of his own, but when the master had
power over life and death; that custom has ceased, and the abolition cannot be
blamed. Some superstition might have been at the beginning; and I certainly
think that the commencement of the change arose from superstition. It is,
however, by no means to be wished that there should be slaves among us, as there
were formerly among all nations, and as there are now among barbarians. The
Spaniards know what servitude is, for they are near neighbors to the Africans
and the Turks; and then those they take in war they sell; and as one evil
proceeds from another, so they retain miserable men as slaves throughout life.
But as no necessity constrains us, our condition, as I have said, is better,
that is, in having hired servants and not slaves; for those called servants at
this day are only hired servants.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When heathens commended humanity and kindness towards
servants, they said, Let them not be treated as servants, but as those who are
hired. So also Cicero said. (Off. 1) he distinguished between servants and such
as were hired, he calls the first slaves, that is, those who were under the
power of another, and those hired servants who undertook to work for hire, as
the case is with us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as I have already said, the practice among the
chosen people was peculiar. For it was the Lord&#8217;s will that those whom he
had redeemed should remain free and enjoy in this respect the benefits of
freedom. That there might then be a memorial of God&#8217;s favor among the
people of Israel, it was the Lord&#8217;s will that servitude among them should
be temporary, even for six years only. And as the law had been disregarded,
Zedekiah exhorted the people to set free their servants. But there is no doubt
but that God at the same time made it known, that external enemies justly
exercised cruelty towards the people, because they themselves shewed no
commiseration towards their own brethren. For when they ruled over their
servants according to their own wantonness, they in vain complained of the
Chaldeans or of the Assyrians, they in vain proclaimed that they were unjustly
oppressed, or that the people of God were harassed by the violence of a
tyrannical power; for the first originators of cruelty were themselves, and not
the Chaldeans or the Assyrians. It was then on this account that Zedekiah was
induced to call the people together, and that by a public act all the servants
were set free.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, that all
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the princes and all the people
heard, who had come to the covenant, that every one should let his servant
free</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc.; and then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they
obeyed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[m&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shemo, </i>is to be taken in a twofold sense; at the beginning of the verse
it refers to the simple act of hearing, and at the end of the verse, to
obedience. Then he says that they <i>obeyed, </i>and that every one set free his
servant. By saying that the princes, as well as all the people, heard, he took
away every pretense as to ignorance; so that they could not make an excuse, that
they relapsed through want of knowledge or through inconsideration. How so?
because they had <i>heard; </i>nor is it to be doubted, but that the Law of God
to which we have referred, had been set before them, that they might be ashamed
of the iniquity and tyrannical violence which they had exercised towards their
servants. The hearing then mentioned here, proves that the Jews were wholly
inexcusable, for they saw that God&#8217;s Law had been long disregarded by
them. And hence we learn, that each of them had sinned the more grievously, as
he had been taught what was right, and had, as it were, designedly cast off the
yoke. So also Christ teaches us, that the servant who knows his master&#8217;s
will and does it not, shall be more severely punished than one who offends
through ignorance.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;421247&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
12:47)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they afterwards
turned</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, after they had heard
and obeyed. The turning refers to a change of purpose, for they immediately
repented of what they had done. They had felt some fear of God, and then equity
and kindness prevailed; but they soon turned or changed. The word is taken
sometimes in a good, and sometimes in a bad sense. He says that they <i>turned,
</i>or returned, because they receded or turned back after having commenced a
right course. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they
remanded</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>there is a correspondence
between the verbs
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wbw&ccedil;y</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>ishibu, </i>they <i>turned, </i>and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wby&ccedil;y</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>ishibu, </i>they <i>remanded, </i>or made to return
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the servants and maids whom they
let go free, and brought them under as servants and
maids</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There is no doubt but that the
Jews alleged some excuse when they thus remanded their servants, and robbed them
of the privilege of freedom: but God designed that they should act in sincerity
and without disguise. Whatever, then, subtle men may contrive as an excuse for
oppressing the miserable, and however they may disguise things before men, yet
God, who requires integrity, does not allow such disguises, for he would have us
to deal honestly with our neighbors, for all craftiness is condemned by
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now follows the message: The Prophet had, indeed,
said that the word of God had been committed to him, but he interposed this
narrative, that we might know for what reason God had sent this message to the
Jews. For if he had thus begun, &#8220;The word came to Jeremiah from
Jehovah,&#8221; and then added, &#8220;Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I
have made a covenant,&#8221; etc., the passage would have been more obscure. It
was therefore necessary that the narrative should come first, and with this the
Prophet&#8217;s message was connected, even that the Jews had added perjury to
cruelty, and thus had committed a heinous iniquity. The Prophet now then comes
to close quarters with them, and introduces God as the speaker,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I made a covenant with your
fathers the day I brought them up from the land of Egypt, from the house of
servants</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God reminded the Jews of their own law; and though he
might have justly required whatever he pleased, yet he proved that the
Israelites were bound to him, because he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>brought then, out of the house of
servants</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Who can dare to arrogate to
himself dominion over others, who is himself a servant? for there cannot be
dominion where there is no liberty. Any one may be free, though without a
servant; but no one can be a master except he be free. So God declares that the
Israelites were not once free, for they were in a miserable state of servitude,
when he stretched out his hand to them. Whence then came liberty to the
Israelites? even from the gratuitous mercy of God, who made them free, who
brought them forth from tyranny in Egypt. It hence follows, that they could not
be masters over others, since they themselves were servants. This is the reason
why he says that he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>made a
covenant the day he brought them up from the house of
servants</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as though he had said, that
they came forth from their prisons, because he had been pleased to draw them
out, not that they might domineer for ever over their brethren, but only for a
time. He relates here the law given by Moses in Exodus 21, as we have stated. At
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the end of seven,
years</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF94</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>every one shall set free his
brother, a Hebrew, who had been sold to him, and him who has served him six
years he shall let free from him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that
is, that he should not be with him;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>but your fathers hearkened not to
me, nor inclined their ear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The
Israelites at first, no doubt, submitted to what God had commanded, but shortly
after the law was disregarded. When, therefore, he complains here that his voice
was not hearkened to, it ought not to be so generally understood, as that the
Law had been at all times disregarded; but it is the same as though he had said,
&#8220;Your<i> </i>fathers formerly were disobedient, because they did not set
free their servants within the prescribed time, at the end of the sixth
year.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage, as many others, clearly shews the great
perverseness of the people. Certainly the Law spoken of here ought to have been
well approved by the Jews, for they found that they were by a privilege exempted
from the common lot of men, and had been preferred before all nations. As, then,
they saw that it was a signal evidence of God&#8217;s bounty towards the seed of
Abraham, this ought to have allured them to observe the Law, inasmuch as they
found in it what was especially suitable to them; but as every one became
addicted to his own private advantage, the poor were oppressed, and a temporary
servitude was changed into what was perpetual. There is no wonder then that men
soon forgot what was right, though they seemed to have hearkened for a short
time to God. It has been the common vice of all ages that the laws of God became
soon forgotten and disregarded; so the law of freedom, though especially
excellent, became, as we see, neglected.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nor inclined their
ear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We have stated elsewhere that this
phrase is emphatic, when added to the expression of not hearkening; for it is a
proof of deliberate wickedness, when men close up their ears, and listen not to
what is right. It is possible for one to neglect what is said, or not to
understand it; but when one intentionally closes his ears, it is a proof of
hopeless obstinacy. God, then, is wont to express by this mode of speaking, the
perverseness and hardness that prevailed in the ancient people, through which
they rejected all sound doctrine. And this ought to be carefully noticed; for
where the word of God is made clearly known, in vain we excuse ourselves for not
following what he commands, for he speaks not obscurely, as he says by Isaiah.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234519&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
45:19) How comes it, then, that doctrine does not produce fruit in us? even
because we wilfully reject it, closing our cars and disregarding God himself
when he speaks. Now the reason why God brings a charge against the fathers is,
that the comparison might enhance the wickedness of their children, who, after
having professed that they had some regard for religion and some feeling of
mercy, soon returned to their old ways, according to what follows
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And ye now turned, and did what was
right in my eyes, by proclaiming liberty every one to his
neighbor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>God seems at first to commend
the people; and no doubt it ought to have been deemed praiseworthy, that the
people, after having been reminded that they had perversely disregarded
God&#8217;s law, willingly engaged in doing their duty; but as they gave but a
false proof of repentance, and did not really perform what they had promised, it
was, as I have said, a great aggravation of their crime. So then God commended
the repentance of the people, in order to shew how detestable is hypocrisy; for
they shewed for a short time some feeling of humanity, but soon after proved
that it was nothing but dissimulation. He therefore says, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>did what was right by proclaiming
liberty</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And hence it also appears that
they had not gone astray through ignorance, for God had required this kindness
from them, that is, to restore what had been wickedly taken away from servants
and maids, and to let them free again: except they had been constrained by the
clear testimony of the Law, they would have never thus given up their private
advantages. But after having made a pretense that they wished to obey God, they
again soon remanded their servants and their maids. It hence appears evident
that they trifled with God, and that it was a mere fraud to set free their
servant only for a short time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>made a covenant in the house on
which his name </i></font><font face="Palatino">had been <i>called, </i>and
also, that they had </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>profaned
</i></font><font face="Palatino">his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>All this added to their wickedness; for not only liberty had been proclaimed
and confirmed by an oath, but this had also been done in the Temple. Hence he
aggravates the sin of the people by this circumstance, &#8212; that they had
made the covenant which they afterwards violated in the presence of God. For
though the eyes of God penetrate into the most hidden recesses, yet the
wickedness of the people became greater, and it was an evidence<i> </i>of men
lost to all shame, that they dared to violate their pledged faith, and thus to
shew no regard for the Temple, as though they had lost all reverence for God and
all fear. It is hence evident how profane they were become, that they dared to
come to the Temple and to make an oath before God, and then immediately to
forfeit their faith.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet expostulates here with the Jews, as we
said in the last Lecture, with regard to their perjury; for they had made in a
solemn manner a covenant in the Temple of God, to set free their servants
according to what the law prescribed. There would have been no need of such a
ceremony, had they observed what they learnt from the Law; but neither they nor
their fathers observed the equity prescribed to them by God. Hence there was a
necessity for a new promise, sanctioned by sacrifice. The Prophet commended them
for obeying God&#8217;s command. But he now shews, that they were the more
inexcusable, because they soon after returned to their old ways.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But ye
turned</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says, that is, they soon
repented of the obedience they had promised to render to God. Their promptitude
was worthy of praise, when they promised that they would willingly obey; but by
doing this in bad faith, they treated God with mockery.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds that God&#8217;s
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>name was
polluted</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We hence learn that whenever
we misuse God&#8217;s name, it is a kind of sacrilege; for nothing is deemed
more precious by God than truth; yea, as he himself is truth, and is so called,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
14:6) there is nothing more adverse to his nature than falsehood. It is then an
intolerable profanation of God&#8217;s name whenever it is falsely appealed to;
and thus perjury is allied with sacrilege. God&#8217;s name is indeed polluted
in other ways than by perjury, that is, when God&#8217;s name is taken in vain
rashly, thoughtlessly, and without reverence. But the most heinous pollution of
it is, when the truth is changed into a lie. This passage then contains a useful
doctrine, which teaches us to act faithfully, especially when God&#8217;s name
is interposed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have remanded every one his
servant and every one his maid, whom ye have set
free</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc. </i>The crime was doubled by this
circumstance, &#8212; that they had emancipated their servants, and then
remanded them. For had they not dissembled, their obstinacy could by no means
have been tolerated; but their rebellion became still more base, when they had
pretended to obey God, and it became shortly known that they had perfidiously
promised liberty to their servants. He says that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>set free to their own
soul</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, to their own will; for we
call men free when it is in their power to choose what they please, for when
they are under the power of another, they have no will, no choice of their
own.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF95</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And indignity is increased, when servants who have been made free are afterwards
deprived of so great a privilege; for nothing is more desirable than liberty, as
even heathens have declared. He adds that this was done by force,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have made them
subject</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The verb

condition, and that they were not constrained to submit to the yoke in any other
way than by tyranny.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet shews that a just reward was
prepared for the Jews, who robbed their brethren of the privilege of freedom,
for they also would have in their turn to serve after the Lord had made them
free. But he alludes to the way then in use in which they had granted freedom,
and says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have not proclaimed
liberty</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>They had indeed proclaimed it,
as we have seen; but not in sincerity, for they who had been for a short time
made free, were soon afterwards constrained to serve. God then makes here no
reference to the outward act which the Jews had performed, but shews that
faithfulness and integrity are so pleasing to him, that he makes no account of
what is merely done outwardly. Hence the promulgation of liberty is not before
God the verbal one, but that which is carried into effect. With men it is enough
to profess a thing, but God regards as nothing all false professions. He
therefore complains that the Jews did not obey his word. We have already said
that it was not right according to the law to retain servants longer than six
years; for in the seventh year the law ordered those who had given themselves up
to servitude to be set free. But God restored this law as it were by way of
recovery, as it had become almost obsolete. And this is the reason why he says
that they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hearkened
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For he had not only taught by Moses
what was right, but had also shewn by Jeremiah that the Jews impiously and
wickedly disregarded this humane command. We hence learn what it is to obey
God&#8217;s word, even when we not only embrace what he declares, but also
persevere in obedience to him: for it is not enough to exhibit some kind of a
right feeling for a short time, except we continue to obey God. The Jews had
with their mouth made a profession, and gave some evidence of a disposition to
obey; the servants were allowed their liberty; but as the masters shortly after
returned to their previous injustice, we see the reason why God says that they
had </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not hearkened to
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is added, that he would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>proclaim liberty to
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, against them. If we read,
&#8220;Behold, I proclaim liberty to you,&#8221; then the meaning is, &#8220;I
will emancipate you,&#8221;<i> </i>that is, &#8220;I<i> </i>shall have nothing
more to do with you; go and enjoy your own liberty; but ye shall immediately
become a prey to other masters, even to the sword, to the pestilence, and to
famine.&#8221; This meaning is not unsuitable; for it was the happiness of the
ancient people alone to be under the protection of God: but when they became
disobedient, he dismissed them, and would not have them under his guardianship.
But nothing can be more miserable than such emancipation, that is, when God
rejects those over whom he had been pleased to rule, and whose patron he had for
a time been; for all kinds of evils will soon come upon them, and God will not
interpose his hand. This, then, is the liberty of those who are not willing to
bear, as it becomes them, the yoke of obedience to God, even to be exposed to
all evils, for it is only by him we can be defended. We hence see that the
meaning is very suitable, when we read &#8220;Behold, I proclaim to you liberty,
but it is to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the
famine.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may, however, take another view, &#8220;Behold, I
proclaim liberty for you,&#8221;<i> </i>that is, against you; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
lamed, </i>has this sense: &#8220;I proclaim liberty against you,&#8221; &#8212;
how?<i> </i>to the sword, etc., that is, &#8220;I order the sword to exercise
power against you, and I will permit also the same right to the pestilence, and
I will permit a like dominion to the famine: the sword, then, and the
pestilence, and the famine, shall rule over you, for ye cannot bear my
authority.&#8221; For though the Jews boasted that they were God&#8217;s chosen
people, yet as they were so refractory as to despise the Law and the Prophet, it
is quite evident that what they wished was unbridled licentiousness. God then
renounces here his own right, and says that it was their fault that they were
not free, for he would no more defend them, as an advocate his clients, or as a
master his servants. So also it is said in the Psalms,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Behold,<i> </i>our
eyes are to God, as the eyes of servants who look to their masters, as the eyes
of a maid to her
mistress.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19C301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
123:1, 2)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We indeed know that servants formerly were exposed to
all sorts of wrongs; they dared not move a finger, when grievously treated; but
if any servant was wronged by another man, his master would undertake his cause
and defend him. Then the Psalmist compares the people to servants and slaves,
and says that their whole safety depended on the help of God. But God now
declares that he will be no longer their guardian; and when he dismissed them,
all kinds of evils, as we have said, would come upon them, even the sword, the
pestilence, and the famine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He at length adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will give you for a
commotion to all the kingdoms of the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>The words may mean two things. Some take them as though God threatened that
they should become unsettled, and vagrants through all the kingdoms of the
world; and others, that they would be for a commotion, for every one either
seeing or hearing of their miserable state would tremble. The passage is taken
from
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;052825&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
28:25, where we read,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I will give thee
for a commotion.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The latter meaning is what I mostly approve, &#8212;
that the Jews would </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>be for a
commotion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for the vengeance which God
would take on them would be so dreadful, that all would be greatly moved or
affected, according to what is said by Isaiah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The, commotion

God would so severely punish perjury and treachery, that the Jews would become
an example to all people; for it would be a sad spectacle for all nations to see
the children of Abraham, whom God had adopted, the most miserable of human
beings. Their condition, then, would be an object of horror; and this is what
the Prophet now declares and threatens. It follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He pursues the same subject, &#8212; that perjury
would not be unpunished. But here is described the manner of making an oath,
even that they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cut a calf into
two parts, and passed between these parts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Now we know that this was the custom in the time of Abraham, for it is said
that he offered a sacrifice to God as a symbol of the covenant, and cut the
victim, and passed between the parts. Historians also relate that the
Macedonians in mustering an army observed the same ceremony; and it was probably
a custom which prevailed among all nations. When the Romans made a covenant,
they sacrificed a sow; they did not divide it into parts, but killed it with a
stone; and this was the form of execration, &#8212; &#8220;So may Jupiter smite
him who will violate this covenant; if I violate this covenant, may Jupiter thus
smite me, as I now kill this sow.&#8221; But we see that among the Orientals,
the victims were cut in two, and there was another form of execration, even that
he might be thus cut asunder, who unjustly and in bad faith violated the given
promise or engagement.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is to this custom the Prophet refers here, and
says, I </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will give the men who
have transgressed my covenant, which they made before me by the calf which they
cut into two parts, and passed between the
parts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. But God assigns a reason why
he resolved to inflict so dreadful punishment on perjury: he said before, that
his name was profaned, and now he adds, that his covenant was violated. He does
not speak here of the Law; the covenant of God is called the law for the most
part in Scripture; but Jeremiah takes it here in a different sense, even the
covenant in which God&#8217;s name was interposed, or what was sanctioned by an
appeal to God, as by way of excellence, marriage is called by Solomon the
covenant of God, because it is the principal contract among men. But as the Jews
had promised in God&#8217;s presence that they were ready to obey, when Jeremiah
commanded the servants to be made free, and as the agreement was confirmed by a
solemn rite, hence the promise given to men is said to be the covenant of God,
even on account of the sanction which we have mentioned.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us then remember, that whenever we perform not
what we have pledged, not only wrong is done to men, but also to God himself,
and that it is a sacrilege, and what is much more atrocious than theft, or
fraud, or cruelty. Let us, therefore, learn from this passage to act in good
faith, especially when the name of God is invoked, when he is appealed to as a
witness and judge.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds afterwards, that they had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>transgressed his
covenant</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and he immediately explains
himself, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because they have not
confirmed the words of the covenant </i></font><font face="Palatino">which
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they had made before
</i></font><font face="Palatino">him. To confirm or establish the words, was to
persevere in what they had promised. For the Jews gave a proof of humanity for a
short time; but it was a mere falacious show and pretense. It was for this
reason, then, that the Prophet says that they had not
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>confirmed
</i></font><font face="Palatino">or ratified
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the words of the covenant which
they had made</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Then follows the outward
ceremony, the <i>calf </i>which<i> </i>they had cut into two parts; and they
passed between them, in order that this very passing might produce a deep
impression on their hearts, and make them dread the violation of their faith.
For we know that external signs are intended for this end, &#8212; that men may
be kept awake, who would otherwise be tardy and slothful. The same also is the
use of sacred symbols, by which God intends to touch and move all our senses. It
hence appears how great must have been the insensibility of the people, when
they afterwards disregarded that awful protest, for they had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>passed between the
parts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and imprecated such a death on
themselves if they failed in what they promised. They afterwards hesitated not
to violate their promise. We hence see that they were under the power of a
diabolical madness, when they disregarded God&#8217;s
judgment.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF97</font></sup><br></div>

them as though they were different persons, but he speaks by way of amplifying.
He then says that he would punish these chief men, lest they should think
themselves to be exempted, because they were superior to others in rank and
honor; for we know that those who are elevated in the world are so filled with
pride, that they deem themselves as free from all laws. This, then, is the
reason why God expressly names the <i>princes </i>and the <i>eunuchs. </i>But he
does not mean by the eunuchs those who had been emasculated, as we have stated
already in several <i>places. </i>The chief men were called by this name,

royal residence and the sanctuary of God. But the Prophet declares that their
lot would be nothing better than that of the common people, because God would
not suffer his holy name to be a mockery and all equity to be violated, and
especially the covenant made in his name to be deemed as nothing, and rendered
wholly void. At length he names

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms and explains what he had before said, and

enemies would not be content with the spoils, or with a moderate punishment, but
would be their inveterate enemies, who would not be satisfied until they
destroyed them. Now this passage teaches us also that the ungodly are
God&#8217;s scourges, for the punishment he resolved to inflict on the
transgressors of his law, he executed through them. Though then the Chaldeans
had another object than to be God&#8217;s ministers in punishing the Jews, yet
they performed God&#8217;s work as though they were his hired servants, subject
to his own will and pleasure. Nor is there a doubt but that their minds had been
greatly exasperated against the Jews, so that they shed blood indiscriminately
withoat mercy: for as God often says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I<i> </i>will give
you favor in the sight of your
enemies,&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(Exodus 3:21;
11:3)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">so also on the other hand, he declares, that when
enemies raged cruelly against them, it was through hls secret influence, he
having resolved severely to punish them. This is the reason why he now says,
that he would deliver the Jews
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>into the hand of those who sought
their life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, who were not intent
on prey or spoils, and would not be satisfied with moderate punishment, but
would be implacable enemies, until they destroyed the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Another kind of punishment follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their carcases shall be for food
to the birds of heaving, and to the beasts of the
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as though he had said, that
God&#8217;s vengeance on the Jews would be made evident even after death. We
said last week, that it would be no loss to us were we to he unburied, for
burial brings no advantage to us; but yet it is a sign of God&#8217;s vengeance.
As then famine, and nakedness, and cold, and diseases, and other evils, are
evidences of God&#8217;s wrath against men, so also it is when the body of a
dead man is cast forth, and is either torn by wild beasts, or eaten by birds. If
any one objects and says, that this has sometimes happened to the best and
holiest of God&#8217;s servants; to this we answer, that temporal punishment
happens in common to the good and the bad; but when God by famine and want, by
diseases also, or by exile, or by prison, or by any other evils, tries and
chastises his servants, all this is to them as a help to their salvation. Yet
this special mercy of God towards the faithful, which is a peculiar privilege,
is no reason why all miseries should in themselves be deemed evidences of
God&#8217;s wrath, for they are everywhere called curses. And we also know that
from the same fountain flow all the evils which men suffer in this life, even
from God&#8217;s judgment, who in this manner executes punishment. It is not
then without reason that the Prophet here declares, that so severe and dreadful
would be God&#8217;s judgment towards the Jews, that it would extend beyond
death itself, for they would become meat to the birds of heaven and to the
beasts of the earth. It follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He repeats almost the same words, but yet he comes
closer to the subject, for he names the enemies of whom he had spoken
indefinitely before. He had indeed said that they would be cruel, and would seek
their death, and would not be otherwise satisfied. He repeats again the same for
the sake of confirmation; but he afterwards adds, that these enemies would be
the soldiers of the king of Babylon, even the Chaldeans. He then shews, as by
the finger, to the Jews, their calamity, lest they should, as usual, indulge
themselves with the hope of security. He does not then declare generally, that
they would be punished, and that enemies would come cruelly to destroy them; but
he points out the army of the king of Babylon, and says that the Chaldeans would
come, being armed by God and fighting under his banner, and would take the city,
and destroy the whole kingdom.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as the Chaldeans had departed, the confidence and
the security of the Jews had increased, for they thought that they were now
freed from danger. The cause of this departure was, that the Egyptians had
gathered an army to help the Jews, or rather to provide by anticipation, for
their own safety. There was an alliance, we know, at that time between the Jews
and the Egyptians; and the object of both was to fortify themselves against the
king of Babylon. The Egyptians had no great care for the Jews, but another
reason influenced them; for it was well known, that as soon as the Chaldeans
finished the Jewish war, they would make an attack on Egypt. Now they thought
that it would be an advantage to them to engage with the Babylonian army in
connection with the Jews; for they would have had to fight alone, had
Nebuchadnezzar gained the victory; nay, the Jews themselves would have been
compelled to assist in subduing Egypt. Hence the Egyptians, having well weighed
these things, gathered a large army. The Babylonians, having heard the report,
went forth to meet them. Thus the siege of the city was left. The Jews exulted
as though they had escaped all danger. Hence the Prophet derides their folly in
thinking that they would now be in peace and quietness, because the Chaldeans
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had gone up
</i></font><font face="Palatino">from them, because they left for a time the
city, and went up towards Egypt.

<div><font face="Palatino">We now see that Jeremiah spared neither the king nor
the princes; and thus we ought to notice the power of the Holy Spirit, which
prevailed in the hearts of the Prophets, for they boldly addressed, not only the
common people, but also kings and princes. As then we find the Prophet
denouncing, with so much courage, the judgment of God on the king and the chief
men, let us know, that none are fit to bear rule in the Church, except they be
endued with so much firmness as not to fear any, and not to be disheartened by
the power of any, so as not to reprove boldly the highest as well as the lowest.

repetition was not in vain, for what we read here seemed incredible to the Jews.
For they raised up their horns when they saw the King Nebuchadnezzar departing
from the city. Lest then this vain confidence should deceive them, he again
declared to them that God conducted the war, as though he had said, that the
Chaldeans had not thoughtlessly taken up arms, but as God had determined, and as
he had commanded them. He does not indeed speak of an open command, for it was
not the purpose of the Chaldeans to obey God, or to render service to him; but
he speaks of his hidden providence. God is said to command, when the ungodly are
guided by his secret impulse, for he can tuae them as he pleases, according to
what is said in other places, &#8220;I<i> </i>will hiss for the
Egyptians,&#8221; or for the Assyrians, or for the Chaldeans. The same is the
meaning here, when he says,

wicked, he commands diseases, he commands the sword, he commands the famine and
the pestilence; and yet there is no reason or understanding in the sword, in the
pestilence, or in the famine: but Scripture thus teaches us that all things are
under his control, so that nothing can touch us, except as far as God intends by
these to chastise or humble us.</font><br></div>

on the Jews, &#8212; that as they<i> </i>had acted perfidiously towards their
servants, God would punish them by making them servants perpetually. When
Nebuchadnezzar went forth to meet the Egyptians, there was some appearance of
freedom being granted; for the Jews thought that theywere afterwards to be free:
but as they had deceived their servants, so the Prophet says, that they were
greatly mistaken in thinking that they were to be perpetually free, because
Nebuchadnezzar would soon return. So he declares that they were doomed to
servitude, so that the liberty in which they gloried would prove illusory. Now

<div><font face="Palatino">It must be first observed, that the order of time in
which the prophecies were written has not been retained. In history the regular
succession of days and years ought to be preserved, but in prophetic writings
this is not so necessary, as I have already reminded you. The Prophets, after
having been preaching, reduced to a summary what they had spoken; a copy of this
was usually affixed to the doors of the Temple, that every one desirous of
knowing celestial doctrine might read the copy; and it was afterwards laid up in
the archives. From these were formed the books now extant. And what I say may be
gathered from certain and known facts. But that we may not now multiply words,
this passage shews that the prophecy of Jeremiah inserted here did not follow
the last discourse, for he relates what he had been commanded to say and to do
in the time of Jehoiakim, that is, fifteen years before the destruction of the
city. Hence what I have said is evident, that Jeremiah did not write the book as
it exists now, but that his discourses were collected and formed into a volume,
without regard to the order of time. The same may be also gathered from the
prophecies which we shall hereafter see, from the forty-fifth to the end of the
fiftieth chapter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The power of the kingdom of Judah was not so weakened
under King Jehoiakim, but that they were still inflated with pride. As, then,
their security kept them from being attentive to the words of the Prophet, it
was necessary to set before them a visible sign, in order to make them ashamed.
It was, then, God&#8217;s purpose to shew how inexcusable was their
perverseness. This was the design of this prophecy. And the Prophet was
expressly commanded to call together the Rechabites, and to offer wine to them,
in order that the obstinacy of the people might appear more disgraceful, as they
could not be induced to render obedience to God, while the Rechabites were so
obedient to their father, a mortal man, and who had been dead for nearly three
centuries. The Rechabites derived their origin from Obad and from Jethro, the
father-in-law of Moses. There are those indeed who think that Obad and Jethro
were the same; but this conjecture seems not to me probable. However this may
be, interpreters think that, the Rechabites<i> </i>were the descendants of Obad,
who followed Moses and the Israelites. And their opinion seems to be confirmed,
because it is said here that they were commanded by Jonadab to live as
sojourners in the land. An inheritance was indeed promised them, but as it
appears from many parts of Scripture, they were unfaith-fifily dealt with, for
they were scattered<i> </i>here and there throughout the tribes. They then did
not enjoy an inheritance as it was right and as they deserved. And we see also
that they lived among other nations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to <i>Jonadab, </i>of whom mention is
made, we read in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;121015&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 10:15, that he was a man of great name and influence, for when Jehu began
to reign, he had him as his friend, though he was an alien. He must, then, have
been in high esteem, and a man of power and wealth among the Israelites. And it
is certain that it was the same Jonadab of whom sacred history speaks of there,
because he is called the son of Rechab; and yet three hundred years, or nearly
so, had elapsed from that time to the reign of Jehoiakim. As to the origin of
this family or people, the first was Obad; from him came Rechab, whose son was
Jonadab, who lived in the time of King Jehu, and was raised up into his chariot
to be, as it were, next to him, when Jehu had not as yet his power firmly
established. But they went afterwards to Jerusalem on account of the continual
calamities of the land of Israel, for it was exposed to constant plunders, and
this we shall hereafter see in the narrative. Then the sons of Rechab did once
dwell in the kingdom of Israel; but when various incursions laid waste the land,
and final ruin was at hand, having left their tents they went to Jerusalem; for
they were not allowed to cultivate either fields or vineyards, as we shall
hereafter see. The Rechabites, therefore, dwelt in the city Jerusalem, which
protected<i> </i>them from the incursions and violence of enemies; but they
still retained their ancient mode of living in abstaining from wine, and in not
cultivating either fields or vineyards. They thought it indeed right for them to
dwell in buildings, because they could not find a vacant place in the city where
they might pitch their tents: but this was done from necessity. In the meantime
they obeyed the command of their father Jonadab; and though he had been dead
three hundred years, they yet so venerated the memory of their father, that they
willingly abstained from wine, and led not only a frugal but an austere
life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet is now bidden to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bring these to the Temple, and to
offer them wine to drink</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I have briefly
explained the design of God in this matter, even that he purposed to lay before
the Jews the example<i> </i>of the Rechabites, in order to shame them; for that
family obeyed their father after he was dead, but the Jews could not be induced
to submit to the command of the living God, who was also the only Father of all.
The Prophet then was bidden to bring them to the Temple, and to lay before them
cups full of wine, that they might drink. He says that they <i>refused </i>to
drink, and brought as a reason, that Jenadab their father forbade them to do so.
We shall hereafter see how this example was applied; for the whole cannot be
explained at the same time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us consider the Prophet&#8217;s words, he says
that the word came to him </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the
days of Jehoiakim</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, after he had
found out by the trial of many years how untameable the Jews were, and how great
was their ferocity. Much labor then had the Prophet undertaken, and yet they
were not so subdued as to submit to the yoke<i> </i>of God. When, therefore,
they had now for many years given many proofs of their obduracy, God summoned
the Rechabites as witnesses, who, by their example, proved that the Jews<i>
</i>were inexcusable for being so rebellious and disobedient to the commands of
the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Go, </i>said he,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the house of
Rechab</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>(we have said that they dwelt
then at Jerusalem, and this will appear hereafter)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and bring them unto the house of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But we must inquire why the
Prophet was ordered to lay wine before them in the Temple rather than in a
private house. The reason, indeed, is evident; for God&#8217;s purpose was to
shew how wicked and perverse the Jews were, for not even the priests abstained
from wine except when they were performing their duties. The Law commanded them
to abstain then from wine; but the Levites, who took care of the Temple, and
also the priests, when not engaged in the discharge of their office, were fully
allowed to drink wine. As, then, the priests were permitted to drink wine even
in the Temple, that is, in the chambers adjoining the priests&#8217; court, what
excuse<i> </i>could have been made when the Rechabites, who were yet of the
common people, and even aliens among the Jews, refused wine according to the
command of their father Jenadab? Had God forbidden the whole people the use of
wine, the Law might have appeared too rigid; but God not only permitted the
people to drink wine, but also the priests; nay, no religious reverence
prevented them from drinking wine close to the Temple when they were not engaged
in their duties. We now, then, perceive why the place<i> </i>has been mentioned,
that is, that the Prophet relates that he brought the Rechabites into the
Temple.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Go, </i>then, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bring them into the house of
Jehovah, into one of the chambers, and offer them wine to
drink</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We have said that the chambers
were nigh the priests&#8217; court; for many of the Levites were always keeping
watch, guarding the Temple, and also some of the priests. The priests, while
serving their turn, alone abstained from wine; but a permission was given by the
Law to the Levites to drink wine, and in those very chambers, which were on both
sides a sort of appendages to the Temple.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now the Prophet adds that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>took
Jaazaniah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>who was a chief man, and as
it were the head of the family. And he names his father, even
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jeremiah, the son of
Habaziniah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and he then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his whole
house</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is added, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>brought them into the Temple,
into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Prophet no doubt chose a
well-known place, that the report of this might spread through the whole city,
and even throughout Judea, and also that the dignity of the place might add
credit to the report; for we know that when a thing is done in an obscure
corner, it may be regarded as doubtful or fabulous. But the Prophet brought the
Rechabites into an honorable place, even
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>into the chamber of the sons of
Hanan</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And he afterwards says, that he
was </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the son of Igdaliah, a man of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Doubtless such was the reverence in
which this man was held, that no one dared to call into question what had been
done there. Then he adds that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>chamber was nigh the chamber of
the princes, which was over the chamber of the keeper of the
treasury</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some render the last word,
&#8220;the<i> </i>entrance,&#8221;</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF99</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the word means a vessel; and it
signifies here the sacred furniture; and there is a change of number, for this
word included all the vessels of the Temple. We hence see that the place was
select, superior to other places, so that it might be as a notable theater, and
that the prophecy might thus gain more credit among all the
Jews.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>set wine before them
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and requested them to drink when full cups were
placed before them. Then he adds that they refused,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We will not drink wine, because
Jonadab our father commanded us, saying, Drink ye no wine, nor build houses, nor
sow seed, nor plant vineyards, nor have any such thing as your
own</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We see that four things were
commanded the Rechabites by their father, to drink no wine, to cultivate no
fields, and to plant no vineyards, &#8212; these were three; and the fourth was,
not to build houses, but to be content with tents. Here is also added a promise,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that ye may live long in the land
where ye are strangers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Then Jonadab
promised to his sons and his posterity a long life, if they obeyed his precepts,
that is, to live without wine all their life, and not to possess anything, nor
build houses. Their saying that they had obeyed their father&#8217;s precept,
shall be hereafter considered, for we cannot take in everything at
once.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But let us now see whether Jenadab did what was right
in forbidding his posterity to drink wine and to cultivate land. Agriculture is
in itself a mode of living not only honest and innocent, but also remote from
ambition, fraud, and plunder: in short, it seems to be of all kinds of living
the simplest and the most innocent. Then the advice of Jenadab to keep his sons
from agriculture might in this instance be blamed and condemned. But the
probability is, that when he saw the Jews and the Israelites despising the Law
of their God, he thought of the vengeance, which, though it followed not for a
long time, yet ought then to have been dreaded. He also saw the sources of
vices, even that the Israelites especially gave themselves up to luxuries, and
indulged themselves, as it clearly appears from the Prophets, in all manner of
excesses. When, therefore, he saw, on the one hand, the corruptions of the land,
and that on the other he dreaded punishment, he wished his posterity to accustom
themselves to an austere mode of living, so that they might more easily move
here and there, and also that they might with more tranquil minds endure any
adversity that might happen, being neither rich nor used to delicacies. Jenadab
then did not condemn agriculture, nor the use of wine, nor commodious
habitations, when he commanded his posterity to be contented with tents and
water, and wished them to buy wheat and to follow only a pastoral life; but as
we have said, he had another object in view. This, then, is what we are, in the
first place, to bear in mind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must observe, at the same time, that the
posterity of Jenadab did not live on plunder, nor spend their time in idleness;
for they were shepherds, who with great labor and many watchings gained their
own living. But it was their father Jonadab&#8217;s wish that they should in a
manner be separated from the common affairs of life, on account of the
corruptions which prevailed, and which he saw rampant before his eyes; so that
he had no doubt as to what was to be, when the Israelites abandoned themselves
more and more to all kinds of excesses, and when all integrity was disregarded.
This then was the reason why Jenadab restrained his posterity from following the
common way of living.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">His counsel is, however, not commended, but the
obedience which<i> </i>his sons rendered; and this is here proposed as an
example, in order to make the Jews ashamed, because they so perversely rejected
the Law of God and the doctrine of the Prophets: and it is an argument from the
less to the greater; for if the authority of a mortal man prevailed so much with
his posterity as to cause them to abstain from wine, and not only to live
frugally, but also to endure cold and want and other hard things, how much more
it behoved the Jews to do what was right and easy, when God commanded them: This
is one thing, even a comparison between God and mortal man. And then there is
another, &#8212; that this precept continued in force for three hundred years,
and kept posterity from neglect; but the Law of God, which continually sounded
in the ears of the people, had no power to influence them. Here is another
comparison. The third is, that God acted equitably, and did not press too much
on the Jews, so as to make the rigor of the law odious and wearisome: as then
God used moderation in his Law, so as to require from the people nothing but
what was easy to be borne, he says that Jonadab was rigid and austere, for he
forbade the use of wine and did not allow his posterity to cultivate fields, nor
to dwell in houses.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This threefold comparison ought then to be borne in
mind, and these three parts of the contrast ought to be well considered, even
that God had not obtained from his people what Jonadab had from his posterity;
and also that God, continually admonishing, prevailed nothing, when a regard for
a dead man retained posterity in their duty; and further, that the Law of God,
which required nothing but what might be easily done, had been perversely
rejected by the Jews, when the Rechabites, in honor to their dead father,
suffered themselves to be deprived of all luxuries, and dreaded not an austere,
rustic, and, as it were, a savage kind of life; for they not only abstained from
wine, but also dared not to shelter themselves from cold by dwelling in houses,
and were forbidden all the comforts of life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now that. the Prophet was ordered to offer them wine,
and that they refused, a question here arises, Was their continency in this
respect laudable? They seemed thus to prefer Jonadab to God, for they knew that
Jeremiah, who offered them wine, was sent by God. But the Rechabites, no doubt,
modestly excused themselves, when they said that it was not right for them to
drink wine, because they had been forbidden by their father. It was not then
their purpose to give more honor to their father than to God or to his Prophet,
but they simply answered for the sake of excusing themselves, that they had
abstained from wine for three hundred years, that is, that the whole family had
done so. This, then, is the solution of the question. But what the Papists do in
bringing against us the Rechabites, first to support their tyrannical laws, and
secondly, in order to torment miserable consciences at their pleasure, is
frivolous in the extreme. As I have already said, the advice of Jonadab is not
commended, as though he had rightly forbidden his sons to drink wine; but only
his sons are spoken of as having reverently and humbly obeyed the command of
their dead father. Then this passage gives no countenance to the Papists, as
though the object of it was to bind the consciences of the faithful to their
laws; for what is here spoken of is, that the Rechabites proved by their
obedience how base and wicked was the obduracy of the people, as they shewed
less reverence and honor to God than these did to a man that was
dead.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Papists, however, dwell much on another
point, &#8212; that whatever has been handed down from the fathers ought to be
observed; and thus they reason, &#8220;The authority of the whole Church is
greater than that of a private man; now the Rechabites are commended for having
followed the command of a private individual, much more then ought we to obey
the laws of the Church.&#8221; To this I answer, that we ought to obey the
fathers and the whole Church: nor have we a controversy with them on this
subject; for we do not simply say, that everything which men have delivered to
us ought to be rejected; but we deny that we ought to obey the laws of men, when
they bind the conscience without any necessity. When, therefore, a religious act
is enjoined on us, men arrogate to themselves what is peculiar to God alone;
thus the authority of God is violated, when men claim so much for themselves as
to bind consciences by their own laws. We must then distinguish between civil
laws, such as are introduced to preserve order, or for some other end, and
spiritual laws, such as are introduced into God&#8217;s worship, and by which
religion is enjoined, and necessity is laid on consciences. &#8212; But I cannot
now finish, for I see that the hour has already passed.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE

<div><font face="Palatino">We said in the last Lecture that the example of the
Rechabites is brought forward, not for the purpose of commending their
obedience, as though it were some great virtue, but only that the Prophet might
reprove the Jews for rendering less honor to the living God, than the Rechabites
did to their dead father. And, doubtless, this comparison must have exhibited
the Jews as acting very disgracefully, for they could not be induced to render
obedience, though they had before their eyes the Rechabites as an example. We
have also said, that Jenadab did not forbid his posterity to drink wine, to sow
fields, and to plant vineyards, in order to set up something new in God&#8217;s
worship; but that he did so, because he deemed it good for his posterity thus to
sojourn in the land, so that they might not become attached to their
possessions, and that amidst various changes they might be less anxious, and be
prepared, as it were, to move elsewhere. We have hence shewn that the Papists
ignorantly pervert this passage in order to support their tyrannical laws, in
which they pretend to include the spiritual worship of God, and by which they
also distress miserable souls; for there is no likeness nor affinity between the
command of Jenadab and those laws which are introduced for the purpose of
establishing the spiritual worship of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For it was not primarily the object of
Jonadab&#8217;s precept to demand from his posterity an abstinence from wine as
a necessary thing, but it had a regard to what was quite different. Now, what is
commanded for another end, as it is not necessary, so it is not opposed to the
word of God; for their liberty of conscience is not taken away: nor was it
Jonadab&#8217;s design to claim for himself the right and authority of God, as
though he were a spiritual lawgiver; but his precept only referred to what was
civil or social. It hence appears how unlike was his command to the tyrannical
laws by which liberty is destroyed under the Papacy. Were it allowable to speak
jocosely, we might say,<i> </i>that it is a wonder that the Papists make so much
of this example, which yet none of them follow; for though the monks have among
them rigid and severe laws, as to eating and drinking, yet the most holy among
them have never observed them; and there has not been a Carthusian or a
Celestian, who submitted to the obligation of abstaining from wine. If then this
virtue of the Rechabites pleases them so much, why do they not discontinue the
use of wine? But this I have not said seriously.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to the subject itself, the solution is
certain and easy, &#8212; that the Rechabites are not commended as though they
had obeyed their father as God, but that they obediently received what their
father had commanded them, because it was only a civil precept: he therefore had
in view an ulterior object; and he did not require abstinence from wine and
other things for its own sake. And Paul, even by one sentence, has settled this
controversy; for when he exhorts children to obey their parents, he modifies his
exhortation by saying,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;In the
Lord.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ephesians
6:1)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We then see that Paul commands children to obey their
parents, not in everything, or without limitation, but so that God, who is the
Sovereign and the only Father of all, may still retain his authority, and that
earthly parents may not claim for themselves so much authority as to ascend the
throne of God, as though they were lawgivers to souls. Let us now proceed

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah explains at large what might have been
expressed in few words, in order to amplify the constancy of the Rechabites. For
one may obey his father, and yet be not so fixed in his purpose, but that he
might on some slight occasion fail in his duty. Jeremiah here shews that such
was the prompt perseverance of the Rechabites, that they could not be enticed by
having wine set before them; but that as though no temptation had been presented
to them, they kept the commandment of their father, who, at the same time, had
been dead, as it has already appeared, some ages before.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They then said, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hearkened to the voice of Jonabab
the son of Rechab, their father</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and
also added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according to all the

again relates what Jonadab had commanded, and to this belongs the sentence,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to all
things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. For had he ordered them
only to be abstemious, to obey would not have been difficult or hard; he
designed to bind them to a wandering life, that they might be covered only by
tents, and that they might not possess anything. As then Jonadab did not in one
thing only try the obedience of his family, it appears more clearly how great
was their promptitude and perseverance<i> </i>in obeying.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They then said, first, that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not to drink
wine</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and also added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all their
days</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We indeed know that the Nazarites
were forbidden to drink wine, but it was only for a time, until they had
performed their vow; we also know, that when the priest was discharging his
duty, he was not allowed, for that time, to take wine. But afterwards the
priests as well as the Nazarites, resumed their common mode of living. But to
taste no wine throughout life was a thing far more difficult. The Prophet, no
doubt, detailed these particulars, that he might load the Jews with greater
disgrace, who, in a matter the most just, and by no means hard, were not, as we
shall see, obedient to God. They said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We, our wives, our sons, our
daughters, </i></font><font face="Palatino">as though they had said, &#8220;This
precept has ever been observed in our family; and what has been delivered to us,
by our fathers, we have followed to this day, as also our fathers, who obeyed
the command of a dead man, because his will had been explained to
them.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They added, that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not to build
houses</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>literally, to inhabit them, that
is, to dwell in them. It was then lawful for the Rechabites to construct houses,
that is, to build them for others; but they were to be contented with tents, and
to live in them. They might then assist others in building splendid palaces, and
thus by their labor gain a livelihood; but they were not allowed to inhabit
them, as this was one of their precepts. They farther added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And a vineyard and a field and a
seed we have not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>If we duly consider
how hard was their condition, we shall see reason to commend the constancy of
the Rechabites, for they were not frightened from their purpose when they saw
that they were brought into miserable straits. But, however, we ought especially
to attend to the object the Prophet had in view, even to shew how shameful was
the perverseness of the Jews,<i> </i>who dared to despise and regard as nothing
the precepts of God, when yet the authority of a mortal man, and one that was
dead, was so great with his posterity. They then said, that they

<div><font face="Palatino">It hence appears that it proved advantageous to the
Rechabites to observe what their father had commanded them: for had they been
fixed to their possessions, they must have been driven into exile with the rest
when the kingdom of Israel was destroyed; what happened to the ten tribes nmst
have happened to the Rechabites. But as they had nothing as their own, they were
freer to move elsewhere; nor had they the trial of leaving possessions, for they
had none. We know that many are so tied to their own houses, fields, vineyards,
and meadows, that they would rather be killed a hundred times than to be torn
away from them. Then Jenadab consulted well the benefit of his posterity, when
he ordered them to dwell in tents; for thus they could collect together in one
day all that they had, according to the known saying of Bias. Hence poverty was
a great advantage to them: their austerity of life was also a benefit to them;
they could without difficulty dwell at Jerusalem, for they had no need of many
luxuries. Had they been accustomed to wine and to other delicacies, they might
have discussed the point, whether it would have been better for them at once to
die than to suffer want in a besieged city. Moreover, as they had lived frugally
and had also been accustomed to an austere life, no anxiety prevented them to
come with confidence to Jerusalem; for they thought that they could gain a
sparing and sordid subsistence by their own labor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It hence then appears what Jenadab had in view, when
he forbade his posterity the use of wine as well as the possession of fields and
vineyards; for he could then foresee what dreadful revolutions were at hand. It
was therefore his purpose thus to train up his posterity, that when difficulties
came they might not succumb under the burden, but patiently bear want or any
other inconvenience, which to others would be intolerable, whenever their former
delicacies came to mind. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We they

make the reproof the more effectual, the Prophet introduces God as the speaker.

<i>musar, </i>means sometimes ruling or governing, and sometimes correction. But
God here no doubt reprehends that madness of the Jews in which they had long
hardened themselves, as though he had said, &#8220;You<i> </i>never think it
right to return to a sound mind.&#8221; Since, then, they had been for a long
time incorrigible and wandered after their own lusts like unbridled wild beasts,
a reproof is here given, as though he had said, &#8220;Will<i> </i>this people
be always ungovernably wanton so as never to submit to the yoke?&#8221; And he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>so as to obey

unjust from the Jews, so that a true excuse could be pretended, as though he was
too rigid: &#8220;I require only,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that<i> </i>ye obey me:
this is all my severity, for lovely is the rule of meekness which I use towards
you. Since, then, I demand nothing but what children ought willingly to render
to their fathers without being admonished, how is it that this mederation is so
displeasing to you,<i> </i>and can by no means be approved by
you?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is then added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>confirmed have been the words of
Jonadab </i></font><font face="Palatino">by his children; but my people do not
obey me. But as we have said in the last lecture, the Prophet touches
particularly on this circumstance, &#8212; that<i> </i>the Rechabites obeyed the
command of their father in not drinking wine: this was hard; they did
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not drink even to that
day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But what did God require from his
children? only to receive his Law, and not to go astray, as it is here added,
after alien gods. There is, then, a contrast between the hard precept of Jonadab
and the equity of the Law; for God required nothing from his people <i>except
</i>to render him pure worship, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have drunk no wine to this
</i></font><font face="Palatino">day &#8212; and why? because they <i>obeyed;
</i>that is, there was no scruple of <i>conscience </i>to prevent them, but the
authority of a man who was dead so far prevailed witIt them, that they willingly
gave up the use of wine. &#8220;As<i> </i>then simple obedience, that is, piety
or respect for their father, produced such influence on the Rechabites, how is
it that I am not heard? for </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
have spoken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,&#8221; </i>he says, &#8220;so
that the sin of the people is not excusable on the ground of
ignorance.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Early rising and
speaking</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here assiduity and diligence
are mentioned. Jonadab only once gave his command to his children; that command,
which might have been forgotten, remained perpetually in the hearts of his sons,
so that they taught the same to his grandsons. But God commanded what was right
not only once, but </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rose up
early</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, he sedulously
anticipated them; for by this metaphor he intimates that he did not wait until
after a continued licentiousness they became more addicted to their vices; for
we know that those who have for many years been without restraint, are not
easily brought into order, but they become<i> </i>habitually refractory. And
hence, also, it comes to be necessary<i> </i>to form those from infancy who are
to be ruled by us; for if they be allowed to act as they please, their
wantonness cannot afterwards be restrained by any laws. God then says, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rose up
early</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, that he anticipated the
Jews, so that together with their milk they might imbibe
religion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds, that he was assiduous in teaching
them, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rising early and
speaking</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>speaking</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he intimates that he had daily repeated the same things, so that
forgetfulness might not be pleaded by the Jews as an excuse:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have spoken to you, rising up
early and speaking, and ye obeyed me not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Then follows an explanation,wthat God had sent the Prophets: the Jews would
have otherwise been ready to object and say, that God had never appeared to
them. Hence he says, that he had spoken to them by his Prophets.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have
sent</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says, and indeed many<i>
&#8212; </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have sent all my
servants</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc.; for if Moses only had
commanded the Jews what was right, they might have pretended that the Law was
buried and forgotten, and that they had no recollection of what Moses had
taught. Hence to meet such evasions, he says shortly, that he had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sent all his
servants</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, that he had sent many
Prophets, and so many, that he continually proclaimed in their hearing the
doctrine of the Law. He again repeats the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rising early and
sending</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>so that he never ceased to warn
and exhort them. Now they who are otherwise tardy and also refractory, yet
become gentle when they are recalled to their duty every day and hour. Since God
then thus urged them by his Prophets, their mad obstinacy became more evident
when they still refused to obey.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now follows that easy requirement, which still more
aggravated their sin, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Turn ye
now, every one from his evil way, and make right your doings,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">(literally, <i>make good) </i>Here God shews
the difference between his Law and the precepts of Jonadab; for he simply
required of the Jews what they ought willingly to have done; for had no Law been
written, natural light was sufficient to teach the Jews that it was their duty
to obey God; for the law of obedience is so written on our hearts, as a
testimony, that no one can justly plead ignorance as an excuse. God then here
declares that he required nothing but what nature itself dictated, even that the
Jews should repent and form their life according to the rule of obedience;
though no Prophet were among them, yet every one ought to have been in this
respect his own teacher.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And walk not after alien gods to
serve them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This admonition still more
clearly proves how moderate was what God required; for he souhlt nothing more
than to retain the Jews under his authority and protection, that he might be a
Father to them. Jonadab might have demanded obedience from his posterity, and
yet have allowed them the free use of wine, and also the possession of fields
and vineyards; but he wished to cut them off as it were from mankind, so that
their condition became worse than that of all the nations and people among whom
they dwelt; for they became, no doubt, objects of ridicule to their neighbors,
endured many reproaches, and were grievously harassed. God shews that he had
abstained from exercising rigid authority, and from requiring unbearable
servitude, and demanded nothing from his people, but that he might be
acknowledged by them as a Father. As, then, he did not tyrannically force the
Jews to render him service, and his Law was moderate in its demands, it hence
appears still more clear, as I have said, how incorrigible was the wickedness
and depravity<i> </i>of that people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He further adds a promise, which ought by its
sweetness to have allured them, so as to become more disposed and prompt to
obey. Though he might by authority have commanded, &#8220;Turn<i> </i>ye from
your superstitions, and faithfully serve me,&#8221; it would yet have been a
command just and equitable; but when he is pleased to add a promise, which ought
to have disposed the Jews to obedience, and yet gains nothing from them, their
wickedness is rendered again by this circumstance still more detestable. We
hence see that there is something important in every clause, and that it is not
without meaning that he here adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye shall dwell in the land which
I gave to you and to your fathers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>God
here sets forfth his own bounty, and then promises a perpetual fruition of it,
provided the Jews obeyed. He says that he gave that land to them, and before to
their fathers, had they never partaken of God&#8217;s bounty, yet the promise
alone ought to have induced them to submit to his authority. But God had been
already liberal to them. Then experience ought to have convinced them, for they
knew that they had obtained the promised land by no other right than by a
promise made by God; they knew that the nations, into whose place they had
entered, had been cast out by God&#8217;s mighty hand. As, then, they had by
experience found God to be bountiful, and as he had promised to be in future the
same, how great and how monstrous nmst have been their madness when they would
not turn to obedience? Then it is also a circumstance of weighty importance,
when God reminded them that it was he who gave the land to them and to their
fathers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have not inclined your ear,
nor obeyed me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We have stated elsewhere
the import of these words, &#8220;Not to incline the ear:&#8221;<i> </i>they
removed the plea of ignorance or of the want of knowledge. God, then, charges
the Jews here with deliberate wickedness; for they had obstinately rejected the
doctrine of the Law, and all the warnings given by the Prophets; for when
doctrine is set before any people, and God is pleased familiarly to teach them,
and nothing is effected, their perverseness is thus more fully made known. God
then intimates here that the Jews had not gone astray through ignorance, for
they sufficiently understood what was right. Whence, then, was there so great a
hardness? even because they had designedly closed their ears, that is, they had
wickedly denied obedience to God, and had been refractory, as it were, through a
long-cherished resolution, so that they could never be brought to a sound mind.

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, after having shewn that the Jews were so
condemned by the example of the Rechabites, that there was no defense for them,
now adds, &#8212; that as the word of God had been to them useless, it would now
be efficacious against them. This is the purport of the verse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have spoken to
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says God; I will now speak to them
no more, but I will speak against them, that is, I will command the Chaldeans,
and they shall be my ministers and the executioners of my vengeance. We hence
see the order which the Prophet has observed: he did not bring forward this
final sentence, which is like a thunderbolt, until he had proved the Jews
guilty. For this purpose was the comparison he made, when he said that the
Rechabites had obeyed their father, and that the Jews had disregarded
God&#8217;s Law and all the warnings given by the Prophets.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet distinguishes between two sorts of
speaking. For God had spoken to the Jews, but he had also spoken against them.

<i>aleph, </i>and the other with
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>oin. </i>By the one the Prophet denotes doctrine, exhortations, and whatever
may lead to repentance, so that men may either be recalled to their duty or
retained in it. This, then, is one mode of speaking, that is, when God addresses
us and invites us to himself. The other mode is that which refers to
threatenings, that is, when God, after having found that he can do nothing by
teaching, has recourse to threatenings, and shews what vengeance awaits us. This
passage, then, is especially worthy of observation, because we hence learn, that
when men reject the word of teaching, they cannot escape the other word, which
denounces the judgment of God. Teaching appears useless when not received<i>
</i>by men; but whosoever despises his word, will find at last, to his own ruin,
that the denunciations by which God confirms and ratifies the authority of his
word, cannot possibly be made void: <i>as, </i>then,

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet, that he might affect the Jews more
deeply, promises a reward to the sons of Jonadab, because they obeyed their
father; and he promises them a blessing from God. Nor is it to be wondered at,
for this commandment, as Paul says, is the first to which a promise is annexed.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
6:2) God promises generally a reward to all who keep the Law, for every command
has in general connected<i> </i>with it the hope of reward; but this is in a
special manner added to the Fifth Commandment: &#8220;Honor thy father and
thy<b> </b>mother, that thou mayest prolong thy life,&#8221; etc. It is, then,
nothing strange that God promised a reward to the Rechabites, because they
followed the command of their father, for he had promised that in the
Law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what the Papists allege, that the obedience
rendered to the Church is on the same account pleasing to God, may, as we have
said, be easily confuted; for if the Rechabites had followed the command of
their father in a thing unlawfill, they would have been worthy of punishment;
but as this precept, as we have shewn, was not inconsistent with God&#8217;s
Law, God approved of their obedience. But the laws which are made for the
purpose of setting up fictitious modes of worship are altogether impious, for
they introduce idolatry. God has prescribed how he would have us to worship him;
whatever, therefore, men bring in of themselves is wholly impious, for it
adulterates the pure worship of God; and further, when necessity is laid on
consciences, it is, as we have said, a tyrannical bondage. Such was not the
object of Jonadab; for what he commanded his posterity was useful, and referred
only to things of this life; and it did not bind their consciences; for when it
was necessary they moved to Jerusalem and dwelt as others in houses; for they
did not erect tents at Jerusalem, but lived in hired dwellings; and yet they
obeyed their father&#8217;s command, for his purpose in ordering them to dwell
in tents, was, that they might remain unincumbered, so that they might be always
ready to move. We hence see how foolishly the Papists pervert this passage in
order to support their tyrannical laws.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And thus this truth may stand, that the obedience of
the Rechabites pleased God, because nature itself requires that children should
obey their parents; and we also know that God often rewards the shadows of
virtues in order to shew that virtues themselves are pleasing to
him.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fF100</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But there is no doubt but that this promise, as I have before said, was
designedly given, in order to stimulate the Jews, according to what is said in
the Song of Moses,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I will provoke
them by a foolish nation, because they have provoked me by those who are no
gods; and I will take vengeance on them, for I will bring forth nations which
were not before.&#8221;

32:21)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So then God now, in order to excite and rouse the
Jews, promises to bless the Rechabites, because they had been obedient to their
father, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall not be cut
off a man from Jonadab</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, from
the offspring of Jonadab,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>standing
</i></font><font face="Palatino">(literally)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before my
face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but as the conciseness<i> </i>of
the verse renders it obscure and ambiguous, I have introduced an addition,
&#8212; but that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he may stand
before my face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And he says that they
would stand before his face, not that they were to be priests or Levites, as
some of the Rabbins have said, who have applied this passage to the priesthood,
because<i> </i>it is often said in Scripture both of the Levites and the
priests, that they stood before the face<i> </i>of God. They, therefore, think
that the same thing is meant here when spoken of the Rechabites. But this is a
strained meaning. God simply intimates, that some of Jonadab&#8217;s offspring
would be always living, and that through his special favor, that their
obedience<i> </i>might not appear to be without its just reward. This is the
meaning. Now follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet relates in this chapter a history worthy
of being remembered, and very useful to us; for he says that he wrote down by
God&#8217;s command what he had previously taught in the Temple, and also that
he sent that summary by Baruch to be recited in the Temple, that the report of
this spread, and that the king&#8217;s counsellors called to them Baruch, and
that when they heard what was written in the volume, they brought word to the
king, having, however, first admonished Baruch to conceal himself, together with
Jeremiah, lest the king should be exasperated against them. And so it happened,
for the king, being instantly filled with indignation, ordered Jeremiah and
Baruch to be taken, that they might be put to death; but they were hidden and
protected through God&#8217;s favor. We shall hereafter see what the king by his
obduracy had effected, even to cause the Prophet to speak more boldly against
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet then says at the beginning, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the word of Jehovah
came</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>by which he was ordered to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>write in a volume of a book
whatever he had previously spoken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By
the volume of a book he means the volume in which he was to write; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rps</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
sepher, </i>does not here mean a written book, for the volume was without any
writing. Then the Prophet must have dictated to his servant Baruch. And this
mode of speaking occurs also elsewhere, as in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;194007&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
40:7. But the Hebrews, according to an ancient custom, called a volume
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlgm</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
megele; </i>for they had no books in a compact form, such as we have in the
present day, but had volumes or rolls; and the same word, volume, is also used
in Latin. For as the Hebrews called what is folded up
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlgm</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
megele, </i>which comes from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">llg</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
gelal, </i>to fold up, or to roll; so the Latins also have derived it from a
verb <i>(volvo) </i>which means to roll, and we call it <i>rolle; </i>and in
Gaul they used the same form of writing; for all ancient documents and also
judicial proceedings were wont formerly to be written on rolls, and in the old
archieves there is nothing found but what is so written. God then ordered his
Prophet to take a roll, and then he commanded him to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>write all the words
</i></font><font face="Palatino">which he had heard from the mouth of God, and
which he had pronounced against Israel, and against Judah, and against all other
nations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We see here, in the first place, what is the benefit
of having the Scripture, even that what would otherwise vanish away or escape
the memory of man, may remain and be handed down from one to another, and also
that it may be read; for what is written can be better weighed during leisure
time. When one speaks only, every one takes in something according to his
capacity and his attention; but as words from man&#8217;s mouth glide away, the
utility of Scripture does hence appear more evident; for when what is not
immediately understood is repeated, it brings more light, and then what one
reads to-day he may read tomorrow, and next year, and many years after. As then
God saw that he had been, as it were, beating the air when he had spoken by his
Prophet, his purpose was that those things which Jeremiah had in vain spoken,
should be written down. In this manner he, no doubt, intended to condemn both
the king and his counsellors, and also the whole people, not only for their
idleness, but also for their insensibility, even because all his teaching had
been without fruit, though Jeremiah had labored much among them, and had been
assiduous and faithful in the discharge of his office as a
teacher.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive the design of God in saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take a volume
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>write in
it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all the words which I have spoken
to thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This was said in order that the
Jews might understand that Jeremiah did not bring forward his own fictions, but
faithfully delivered what he had heard from God&#8217;s mouth. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>against Israel and affainst
Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For Jeremiah at the beginning had
prophesied against the ten tribes; but after the kingdom of Israel was cut off,
he performed his office only towards the remaining people, so that his doctrine
referred especially to the Jews. It is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>against all
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and this we shall presently
see; and it hence appears that his prophecies were not written according to the
order of time, as I have before reminded you, but that the volume was written
without regard to order. It was yet so far preserved that this book contains a
summary of all the doctrine taught by Jeremiah during the whole course of his
ministry. He says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the day
in which he began to speak</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>even
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the days of
Josiah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to this
day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And the Prophet had been performing
his duty as a teacher, not for ten, or twenty, or thirty, but for forty years.

<div><font face="Palatino">We have seen how the Prophet labored, not only to
terrify his own nation by threatenings, but also sweetly to allure them to the
service of God; but God speaks here of them as of perverse men, who were almost
intractable, according to what is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;191826&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
18:26, that God would be severe towards the perverse; for God deals with men
according to their disposition. As the Jews then were unworthy that God should,
according to his gentleness, teach them as children, this only remained for
them, to repent under the influence of fear.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bear all the

only on threatenings, for this alone remained for men so
obstinate.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The evil which I think to
do</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. God here transfers to himself
what belongs to men; for he does not think or deliberate with himself; but as we
cannot comprehend his incomprehensible counsel, he sometimes assumes the person
of man; and this is what is common in Scripture. But he says, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thinks
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of what he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pronounces
</i></font><font face="Palatino">in his word; for as long as God exhorts men to
repent, he holds, as it were, his hand suspended, and allows an opportunity to
repent. He then says, that he is, as it were, in the midst of his deliberations:
as when one wants to know whether an offender will submit, so God transforms
himself, in a manner, into what man is, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
think</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, let them know that
vengeance is not in vain denounced in my word; for I will perform whatever I now
threaten, except they repent.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they may turn every one from
his evil way</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is to <i>hear,
</i>previously mentioned, even when men become seriously touched, so as to be
displeased with their vices, and to desire from the heart to surrender
themselves to God. He joins a promise, for without the hope of pardon it cannot
be, that men will repent, as it has been often said; but it must be repeated,
because few understand that faith cannot be separated from repentance; and a
sinner can never be induced to return truly to God, unless he entertains a hope
of pardon, for this is a main truth, according to what is said in

<div><font face="Palatino">Then, according to what is commonly done, the Prophet
says, that if the Jews turned to God, he would be propitious to them, as though
he had said, that men would not be disappointed, if they repent, because God
would readily meet them, and be reconciled to them: for this one thing alone, as
I have said, is what can encourage us to repent, that is, when we are convinced
that God is ready to give us pardon. He mentions <i>iniquity and sin. </i>The
Prophet, no doubt, referred to these two words, in order to shew that we ought
by no means to despair, though sins be heaped on sins. It follows &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet declares that he dictated to Baruch,
a servant of God, whatever he had previously taught. But there is no doubt but
that God suggested to the Prophet at the time what might have been erazed from
his memory; for all the things which we have some time ago said, do not always
occur to us. Therefore the greater part of so many words must have escaped the
Prophet, had not God dictated them again to him. Jeremiah then stood, as it
were, between God and Baruch; for God, by his Spirit, presided over and guided
the mind and tongue of the Prophet. Now the Prophet, the Spirit being his guide
and teacher, recited what God had commanded; and Baruch wrote down, and then
proclaimed the whole summary of what the Prophet had taught.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He therefore says, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>called to him Baruch the son of
Neria</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>who wrote from his mouth, and he
wrote </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all the words of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Jeremiah repeats again that
nothing came from himself. We hence see that he did not dictate, according to
his own will, what came to his mind, but that God suggested whatever he wished
to be written by Baruch. It is added, that he commanded Baruch to recite in the
Temple what he had written, because he himself was detained. Some think that he
was shut up in prison; and he used the same word before, when he told us that he
was cast into prison by Zedekiah. But as sacred history does not say that he
suffered any such thing under Jehoiakim, I am inclined to think that he was
prevented by God; I do not, however, ascribe it to a divine oracle; for it might
have happened either through God&#8217;s command, or through some human
impediments.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF101</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> If we believe the Prophet to have been
in prison, and that he might have gone out, he yet abstained; for the more
liberty was given him, the more bound he felt himself to continue in prison,
lest he should violate public authority. But the other supposition is more
probable, that he was detained by God&#8217;s hand. However this may have been,
he says that he could not go forth; and he mentioned this, lest it should appear
that he was only careful as to himself, and that through fear of danger, he
devolved this duty on Baruch. He then shews that he did not shun his office,
because it exposed him to hatred, but that he was not at liberty to go
forth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go
thou</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>then, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and read in the
volume</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Prophet, in this case, was
ready to incur any odium which might be, for he did not bid Baruch to relate by
memory what he had heard from him, but ordered him to take the volume, and to
read, as we shall hereafter see, what he had written. The Prophet then did not,
in this instance, avoid danger, and put Baruch in his own place, but he
expressly told him to read from the volume:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What thou hast
written</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he
<i>says,</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from my
mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>what Jehovah has
spoken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>these things
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>read thou to the people in
</i></font><font face="Palatino">the Temple, on
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a fasting
day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This day was chosen, first, because
there was then a greater concourse of people, according to what immediately
follows, for he was to read these things in the ears not only of the citizens,
but also of the whole people; and on fast-days they were wont, as it is well
known, to come in great numbers to the city for the purpose of sacrificing. It
was then God&#8217;s purpose that these threatenings should be proclaimed, not
only to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, but also to all other Jews, that the
report of them might spread to every part of the land. In the second place, such
a day was much more suitable to the message conveyed; for why was a fast
enjoined, except humbly to supplicate God&#8217;s mercy, and to deprecate his
wrath? As then this was the design of a fast, the Jews ought to have been then,
as it were, in a submissive state of mind, prepared calmly to receive these
threatenings, and to profit by them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We then see that there were two reasons why the
Prophet, by God&#8217;s command, fixed on this day, &#8212; first, because there
was a larger number of people, &#8212; and, secondly, because a fast ought to
have rendered them teachable, so that they might more readily submit to God,
acknowledge their sins, and, being terrified, might also flee to God&#8217;s
mercy, and thus loathe themselves on account of their sins. The rest

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah, after having dictated to the scribe Baruch
what he had before preached to the people, repeats what the object was, which we
have previously observed; for it was God&#8217;s will to make the trial, whether
the people could by any means be restored to a sound mind. This had, indeed,
been in vain attempted for a long time; but God was yet willing to proceed to
the utmost extent in his mercy. Hence Jeremiah now declares the purpose for
which he wished the book to be read to the people. Nor is there a doubt but that
Baruch had been thus admonished, that he might exhort the people to repentance
as it were from the mouth of Jeremiah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, there are two things mentioned as necessary in
order to obtain pardon, &#8212; prayer, and turning or conversion. For if any
one only in words seeks to be reconciled to God, he will not succeed.<i>
</i>Turning or conversion cannot be separated from prayer. But then were a
sinner to repent a thousand times, he would still remain exposed to God&#8217;s
judgment; for reconciliation, by which we are absolved, does not depend on
repentance,<i> </i>but on the gratuitous favor of God; for God does not receive
us into favor because he sees that we are changed to a better mind, as though
conversion were the cause of pardon; but he embraces us according to his
gratuitous mercy. This, then, is the reason why Jeremiah joins together these
two things &#8212; prayer, and conversion or repentance; for as I have said,
hypocrites confess in words their sins and seek pardon, but it is with a feigned
or a double heart. Hence that prayer may be genuine, repentance<i> </i>must be
added, by which men shew that they loathe themselves. And then, ou the other
hand, it is not enough for us to turn or repent, except the sinner flees to the
mercy of God, for pardon flows from that fountain; for God, as it has been said,
does not forgive us for any merit in us, but because it seemeth him good to bury
our sins. The sum of the whole is, that God would have the prophecies of
Jeremiah to be recited before the whole people, as they were conducive to their
safety and salvation. The manner is described, &#8212; that the people were
humbly to pray and also really to repent.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It may be, a prayer will
fall</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF102</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>we have elsewhere explained its
meaning. The Scripture speaks of prayer, that it rises and that it falls. Both
expressions are suitable, though to be understood in a different way; for prayer
cannot be rightly offered except man ascends and falls. These two things seem
contrary, but they<i> </i>well agree together; nay, they cannot be separated.
For in prayer two things are necessary &#8212; faith and humility: by faith we
rise up to God, and by humility we lie prostrate on the ground. This is the
reason why Scripture often says that prayer ascends, for we cannot pray as we
ought unless we raise upwards our minds; and faith, sustained by promises,
elevates us above all the world. Thus then prayer is raised upwards by faith;
but by humility it falls down on the earth; for fear ought to be connected<i>
</i>with faith. And as faith in our hearts produces alacrity by confidence, so
also conscience casts us down and lays us prostrate. We now understand the
meaning of the expression.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because great is the wrath and
indignation which Jehovah hath pronounced</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>or hath spoken, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>against this
people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By wrath and indignation we are
to understand God&#8217;s vengeance, the cause being put for the effect. But the
Prophet intimates, that except men are wholly blinded, and as it were estranged
in mind, they ought to be very deeply touched, when God sets before them some
dreadful judgment. When God chastises some slight fault, and when he does not so
very grievously threaten us, we ought to feel alarmed; but when God shews his
wrath to be so kindled that final ruin ought to be dreaded, we must be stupid
indeed, if such a threatening does not terrify us. Then the Prophet says that
there was no hope of relaxation, for God had pronounced no light or common
judgment on the people; but he shews that he was prepared to destroy the whole
nation, as the Jews had deserved extreme punishment.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the promptitude of Baruch is commended, for he
did not disobey God&#8217;s Prophet, but willingly undertook the office deputed
to him. His office, as we have said, was not without danger. As then his message
was by no means popular, but on the contrary very disagreeable, hence<i> </i>is
seen the devotedness of Baruch. He made no refusal, for he knew that this burden
was laid on him for some purpose. Jeremiah then says, that

speaking, has no other author but God. So Paul called that Gospel, of which he
was the preacher and witness, his Gospel; and yet he himself had not devised the
Gospel, but had received it from Christ, and faithfully delivered it as from his
hand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We ought, therefore, to notice this mode of speaking,
which occurs everywhere in Scripture, &#8212; the same thing is ascribed to God
and to his servants. Thus we find what may seem strange, &#8212; the Apostles
are said to forgive sins, they are spoken of as bringing salvation; but the
reason is, because they were ministers of God&#8217;s grace, and exhorted men in
Christ&#8217;s name to be reconciled to God. They then absolved, because they
were the testifiers of absolution. So also the words which God dictated to his
servant were called the words of Jeremiah; yet, properly speaking, they were not
the words of man, for they did not proceed from a mortal man, but from the only
true God. It follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here is added a fuller explanation; for the Prophet
relates nothing new, but according to what is common in Hebrew he expresses at
large what he had before briefly stated: for he had said, that Baruch read in
the Temple the words of God as he had been commanded; but he now relates when
and how this was done, even in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the fifth year of
Jehoiakim</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and when a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fast was proclaimed in the ninth

fF104</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We<i> </i>now then see the
design of this repetition, even to point out more clearly the time. He then says
that the book was read and recited when a fast was proclaimed in the fifth year
of Jehoiakim. The Jews, no doubt, knew that some grievous calamity was at hand,
for this proclamation was extraordinary. And we know that when some calamity was
apprehended, they usually betook themselves to this remedy, not that fasting in
itself was pleasing to God, but because it was a symbol of humiliation, and it
also prepared men for prayer. This custom did not creep in without reason, but
God designed thus to habituate his people to repentance. When,<i> </i>therefore,
God manifested some tokens of his displeasure, the Jews then thought it
necessary, not only to seek forgiveness, but also to add fasting to their
prayers, according to what we find in the second chapter of Joel as well as in
other places. It was then a solemn confession of sin and guilt; for by fasting
they acknowledged themselves to be exposed to God&#8217;s judgment, and also by
sackcloth and ashes; for they were wont to throw aside their fine garments and
to put on sackcloth, and also to scatter ashes on their heads, or to lie on the
ground: and these were the filth as it were of the guilty: and in this state of
debasement they sought pardon of God, thus acknowledging in the first place<i>
</i>their own filthiness by these external symbols, and secondly, confessing
before God and angels that they were worthy of death, and that no hope remained
for them except God forgave them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, then, Jeremiah writes here that there was a fast
proclaimed, there is not the least doubt but that some tokens of God&#8217;s
vengeance then appeared. And though Jehoiakim had provoked the King
Nebuchadnezzar by refusing to pay tribute, yet the idea prevailed always among
the Jews that nothing happened except through the just vengeance of God. As,
then, they knew that they had to do with God, they thought that it behoved them
to pacify him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds, that a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fast before Jehovah was
proclaimed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>not that it was meritorious,
or that an expiation would thereby be done, as the Papists imagine, who think
that they can redeem their sins by fastings, and hence they call them
satisfactions; but the Prophet says that the fast was proclaimed
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as an addition to prayer. As,
then, it was a solemn meeting for prayer, fasting was, as it were, a part added
to it, that they might by this external symbol more fully humble themselves
before God, and at the same time testify their repentance. And he says that it
was proclaimed to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all the people
</i></font><font face="Palatino">who were at Jerusalem, and to the other Jews
who came from other cities to the Temple to pray. And we hence conclude that
fasting in itself is of no moment, but that it was an evidence of repentance,
and therefore added to prayer. And Christ, having mentioned prayer, added
fasting,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401721&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
17:21) not that fasting ought not to be separated from daily prayers; for we
ought always to pray; but we are not to fast morning and evening; nay, we pray
when our table is prepared for us and meat are set before us; and then when we
dine and sup, we pray to God. But this is to be understood of more serious
prayers, when, as we have said, God summons us, as it were, before his tribunal,
and shews manifest tokens of his displeasure. And for this reason also, Paul, in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460705&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 7:5, when bidding husbands to dwell with their wives, adds
this,</font><br></div>

for a time&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; for what purpose? even that they might give
themselves wholly to prayer<i> </i>and fasting. We hence see that fasting was
not an ordinary thing, but when required by some urgent
necessity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then, this also is to be noticed, that the fast was
proclaimed to the other Jews who had come to Jerusalem; for why was it necessary
for them to come to Jerusalem, except humbly to supplicate God&#8217;s
favor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>roll was then read in the Temple,
in the chamber of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan the
scribe</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The chambers, as we have before
said, were annexed to the court of the priests; for the Levites were the
guardians of the Temple; and every priest also, while performing his duty,
remained in the Temple. As to Shaphan, he is called a scribe, not the
king&#8217;s chancellor, who is afterwards called by the same name; for I regard
him as being an actuary. For they called the scribes
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yrps</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>sepharim; </i>but sometimes by this name are meant the interpreters of the
Law, and sometimes the actuaries, whose office it was to collect the prophecies,
or who were engaged in collecting public acts. Then Gemariah, the son of Shaphan
the scribe, had his chamber in the Temple; and he says, in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the higher
court</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Hence we conclude, according to
what I have already said, that these chambers were parts of the court. And he
adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the entrance of the new
gate of the Temple</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some think that this
was the eastern gate, and that the greatest concourse of people was usually
there. We hence see that Baruch boldly performed his duty in reading the roll,
though the reading of it must have greatly exasperated the minds of the whole
people. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

to the princes and the king&#8217;s counsellors, he may have been an informer,

this example, that not all who hear are so teachable and ready to obey as to
make proficiency in the knowledge of good and holy doctrine: we see that many
patiently hear and give some evidence<i> </i>of docility, and yet cherish
perverseness in their hearts, and afterwards calumniate what they have heard.
Such may have been the character of Michaiah, spoken of here. But his case may
have been different, &#8212; that being filled with wonder, he conveyed to the

to his servant Baruch; but the Lord protected them. However, the impiety and the

the Temple; but though they were not wholly irreligious, yet they shewed some
pride, as they commonly do who are surrounded with splendor, being not disposed
to humble themselves. We see that all courtiers are so inflated with pride, that
they think it a disgrace to mingle with the common people. They wish some
special honor to be reserved for themselves. This was the reason that they did
not go up into the Temple that they might learn the message, but sent for Baruch
to come to them. Now it was this that prevented them from the heart to
repent.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">We see that there was some regard for religion in the
princes, for they submitted to hear, and respectfully<i> </i>received the
Prophet&#8217;s servant. Had Jeremiah himself come, he would, no doubt, have
been received as God&#8217;s Prophet, as such honor was given to his servant,
that the princes ordered him to be seated, which was certainly a favor. It hence
appears that they were not profane despisers of God. Then follows another thing,
&#8212; that they were moved </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with
fear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Then as to the king&#8217;s
counsellors, we see that they were in such a state of mind, that they readily
listened to, and dreaded the threatenings of God. But it was a fear that no
doubt soon vanished; and what he says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they feared each as to his
neighbor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>was a sign of a change; for he
who fears as he ought, thinks of himself, and examines himself before God; but
when the mind wavers, eyery one looks to another. It was then a sign of
repentance not real and genuine, so to fear as to look to one another, for they
ought, each of them, to look to God, that they might from an inward
consciousness acknowledge their sins, and thus flee to the true
remedy.</font><br></div>

their fear was such, that they did not yet wish to offend the king. They then
referred the matter to him, being anxious to gratify him. This is the religion
of the court, even so to fear God as not to lose favor, but on the contrary, so
to perform one&#8217;s duty, as not to be liable to the charge of not being
sufficiently attentive and devoted to the king&#8217;s interest. In short, the
Prophet thus represents to us, as in a glass, the religion of the king&#8217;s
counsellors, and shews to us at the same time that their minds were corrupted by
ambition, and that ambition so prevailed, that they paid more regard to a mortal

unbelieving are wont to be; and not receiving as they ought to have done, the
heavenly doctrine, they vacillated, and could not pursue a uniform course. Such,
then, was the uncertainty that possessed the minds of the princes; for they
could hardly believe that these words had been delivered by memory, but had
suspicion of some trickery, as the unbelieving imagine many such things

no more than what might satisfy the princes, yet the purport of the whole is,
that Jeremiah did not produce the roll from a recess or his desk, but promptly
gave utterance to what God&#8217;s Spirit suggested to him. Their astonishment,
then, must have increased, when the king&#8217;s counsellors knew that these

their own indifference. They seemed, indeed, to be for a moment awakened, and
seriously to acknowledge God&#8217;s judgment; but these thoughts presently

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now relates that the princes went to the
king, after having first deposited the roll with Elishama the scribe; for as the
king&#8217;s ears were tender, they were unwilling to perform at once so odious
an office. And thus they who are with kings, and engage their attention,
fascinate them with their flatteries; for there is in courts no independence,
for the greatest flatterer is the highest in favor. As, then, all courtiers seek
eagerly to find out how they may please kings, so they carefully beware lest
they should offend them. This was the reason why the princes deposited the roll
with Elishama. We hence learn that their regard for God was small and frigid;
for if they believed that Jeremiah had dictated to his scribe what he had
received from the Spirit of God, the offending of the king ought not certainly
to have been deemed by them of so much moment. Why, then, did they not venture
immediately to bring forward the roll, and to exhort the king to hear, except
that adulation, as I have said, is always timid. Hence then it was that they
ventured not to shew the roll to the king, but only told him that they had read
some dreadful things, so that the king did not find fault with them, as they had
not too boldly brought before him what he was unwilling to hear. This, then, is
one thing.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sent Jehudi to fetch the roll
from the chamber of Elishama the scribe</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>In the person of Jehoiakim we see how the unbelieving shun and seek God at
the same time, but with a confused mind, as they know not what they seek. The
king might have heedlessly despised what had been related to him, for if he
wished to be free from all trouble, why did he order the roll to be brought to
him, and a part of it to be read? We hence see that the unbelieving, though they
wish to go as far as possible from God, yet run to him in a sort of blind
manner; but this they do not of their own accord; for God by his secret impulse
draws them to himself, so as to render them more inexcusable. Hence it comes,
that curiosity leads many to hear the truth, and some madly ask, what is the
truth to them? like wild beasts when they run against swords. Such was the
disposition of Jehoiakim, for he wished all the prophecies of Jeremiah to be
buried; and yet he could not restrain himself, but would know the substance or
some part of them. He therefore

that his impiety became more evident, as he was not moved by the predictions
read to him. He could not indeed endure the recitation, but after some chapters
had been finished, he became so enraged, as we shall see, that he threw the roll
into the fire and burnt it. It was, however, God&#8217;s purpose to take away
from the king as well as from his counsellors every pretext, that they might not
afterwards allege that they had fallen through ignorance, for after the roll had
been presented to them, it was their own fault if they were not restored to that
state of safety from which they had fallen. He now adds &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Jeremiah shews how little he had effected; for
the king not only cast aside but tore the roll into pieces, and after having
torn it, he wished its memory to perish, for he cast it into the fire. This
trial must have grievously affected the mind of the Prophet; he had dictated
that roll by God&#8217;s command; he saw now that all his labor had been in
vain. He might then have complained to God that so much labor had been spent
without fruit. For why had God bidden the roll to be written, except for the
purpose of leading the king and his counsellors to repentance. As to the people,
the Prophet could not know whether it had answered the end for which he sent his
scribe Baruch to them, for no account is given as to the attention paid by them.
But Baruch was led to the king&#8217;s palace, so the minds of all were kept in
suspense: what was now the issue? The king burnt the roll. There is no doubt
then but that the mind of the Prophet was much affected. But God thus exercises
his servants when he bids them to speak to the deaf or to bring light to the
blind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us then learn simply to obey God, though the
labor he requires from us may seem to be useless. And hence Paul rises above all
the ingratitude of the world and says, that the ministers of the Gospel are a
sweet odor to God, whether for death or for life,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470215&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 2:15, 16) for though the greater part are rendered worse by hearing
the Gospel, yet the obedience rendered to God by ministers is acceptable to him,
nor is the event to be looked to. Jeremiah then saw that the king&#8217;s mind
was exasperated, but he did not on that account repent of his obedience, for he
knew that the event was to be left with God and to his will. The duty of men is
to execute whatever God commands, though no fruit may appear to proceed from
their labors. This then is one thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now as to the king, we see in him as in a glass how
monstrous is their blindness who are the slaves of Satan. Surely the king, when
God so thundered in his ears, ought to have been terrified. He could not indeed
treat the word with ridicule, but he became enraged, and acted violently like a
rabid wild beast, and vented his rage against the roll itself! If he thought
Jeremiah to have been the author, why did he not disregard him as a man of no
authority in public affairs? for Jeremiah could not have lessened his character
as a king. There is then no doubt but that he perceived, though unwillingly,
that he had to do with God; why then did he become thus enraged? what could he
hope to gain by such madness towards God? But this, as I have said, was that
dreadful blindness which is found in all the reprobate, whose minds the devil
has fascinated; for on the one hand they perceive, willing or unwilling, that
God is present, and that they are in a manner summoned to his tribunal; and on
the other, as though they were forgetful of God, they rage madly against
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is then said of King Jehoiakim, that while he was
in his winter-house and sitting before the

Jehudi finished the roll; after he had heard three or four leaves, or pages, as
we call them, he seized the roll and cut it; and in the second place, being not
content with this sacrilege he burnt the roll, as though he could abolish
God&#8217;s judgment together with the book. But we shall hereafter see what he
gained by this intemperate spirit in burning the roll

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now connects doctrine with the narrative,
for what we have hitherto seen would be frigid were no instruction added. The
Prophet then shews why he had related what we have read of the king&#8217;s
impious obstinacy. But there is more force in a simple statement than if the
Prophet in high-sounding words inveighed against the king and his counsellors;
for he speaks here as one astonished; They
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rent
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says, their garments,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>nor feared
</i></font><font face="Palatino">when they heard threatenings so dreadful. And
doubtless it may be justly deemed as the most monstrous of things, that
miserable men should with such contempt disregard the threatenings of God, which
yet they ought to have dreaded no less than instant destruction. That mortals
then should not be moved when God fulminates by his threatenings against them,
but on the contrary become more hardened &#8212; this is an evidence of a
diabolical madness. It is hence not without reason that the Prophet says, as one
astonished, that neither the king nor his counsellors <i>feared </i>nor <i>rent
</i>their garments.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, we are taught in this passage that it is a sign
of reprobation when we are not terrified when God threatens and declares that he
will become our judge, and when he brings forward our sins, and also shews what
we deserve. When, therefore, all those things produce no effect on us, it is a
sure sign of hopeless madness. This is what the Prophet means when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they feared
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>for his object was to shew that
all, as well as himself, ought to stand amazed, that the king and his
counsellors could thus fearlessly withstand the threatenings of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the <i>garments, </i>the sign is put for the
thing itself; and then a statement of a part is made for the whole: in the first
place, to rend the garments is of no great moment, unless the heart be first
rent, as Joel says in the second chapter; but though hypocrites make a shew of
repentance by fallacious signs, yet when true and sincere repentance is treated
of, the sign is put in the place of the thing signified, as in this passage,
they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rent not their
garments</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, they manifested no
fear. And as the rending of garments was usually done, he says that they rent
not their garments, when God by the mouth of Jeremiah<i> </i>and by the hand of
Baruch fulminated against them. There is, in the second place, a part stated for
the whole, because they were wont to put on sackcloth, and to sprinkle ashes on
their heads. There is here a mention made only of garments; but other signs were
also included.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When they heard all these

volume, but three or four chapters were sufficient to condenm him; for there is
no doubt but that he was abundantly convicted, and that he threw himself into
such a rage as to cut the roll and not to rend his garments, because he dreaded
God&#8217;s judgment. And there is a striking alliteration in the words
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[rq</font><font face="Palatino">

the king did not cut (it is the same word) or rend his garments. The king had
before cut the roll and torn it in pieces, when, on the contrary, he and the
rest ought to have cut or torn their garments, and were it lawful, even
themselves, when God terrified them with such dreadful threatenings. It follows

this circumstance, that three men opposed him, though they thereby subjected
themselves to great danger. They saw that the king was carried away by the
violence of his temper; and when he resisted God in a manner so insolent, what
would he not have dared to do to them? That they notwithstanding hesitated not
to intercede with him, was an instance of great courage. But it hence appears,

</i>Many interpreters have not attended here to what is emphatical, and have
therefore perverted the meaning of the Prophet, or at least have extenuated it
so as not to represent faithfully the object of the Prophet; for there is, as I
have said, a very emphatic exaggeration in the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nevertheless</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>And let us learn from this passage, that when God draws us back from wicked
designs, we are less excusable if we persevere in executing what he clearly
shews ought not to be done. Conscience will indeed always be to us in the place
of thousand witnesses; and though no one be present as a witness or an adviser
or a monitor, yet we shall in vain try to escape before God by pretending
ignorance or mistake or want of thought: but when the Lord by the
instrumentality of men calls us back, so that we may not go on in evil ways, if
we are not persuaded to desist, then discovered more fully is our incorrigible
perverseness, according to what the Prophet intimates here. In short, let us
know that any one sins the more grievously, the more means God employs to draw
him back from his evil course.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since, then, we see how obstinate Jehoiakim was,
there is no reason for us to wonder, that many at this day go on presumptuously
in their course, though God as it were checks them, or at least sends men to
restrain them. Let us, then, know that it is an old evil, so that we may not be
disturbed by such a presumptuous contempt of the ungodly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us also notice the example given here of a bold
admonition: for it is something like a miracle to find those at this day in the
courts of princes, who are bold enough to remonstrate when there is much danger;
for, as it has been before stated, every one is ingenious in devising means to
flatter; and as this is the best and shortest way to elevation, all apply
themselves assiduously to this art. The Prophet had indeed said that the king
and his counsellors did not rend their garments, and yet he tells us now of
three who openly professed that they feared God: but when he spoke before of all
the princes, we must understand him as speaking of them as a body. Then the
three, mentioned now, must be excepted; nor is there a doubt but that they
incurred the displeasure of all the courtiers, as they had them opposed to them,
since they must have been ashamed of their own negligence; but they dared to
draw on themselves the displeasure both of the king and of all the rest, for
they saw that it was God&#8217;s cause. It follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">We now see what reward Jehoiakim brought on himself,
by his impiety and perverseness. But there are two clauses; in the first, God
reproves him for having insolently dared to impose silence on the Prophet; and
in the second, he adds a punishment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt say to

<i>al, </i>as it appears from the context; it indeed properly means
<i>concerning, </i>or <i>upon, </i>as in the next verse, God thus speaks <i>of
Jehoiakim. </i>But as the Prophet is here bidden in the second person to address
him, the other meaning, <i>to, </i>is better, even that he was bidden to address
the king, and to address him by name: Then it is, &#8220;Thou shalt speak <i>to
</i>Jehoiakim, the king of Judah.&#8221; The word king, is mentioned not so much
for honor&#8217;s sake, as to shew that he in vain gloried in honor, or in a
title of dignity; for as we have elsewhere seen, the Prophet had been sent to
reprove mountains and hills, and not to spare kings or kingdoms.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;330601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Micah
6:1;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
1:10) It had then been said to him,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I have set thee
over nations and kingdoms.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As then Jehoiakim could not be so filled with pride
as to think that everything was lawful to him, God intimates that there was no
reason that royal splendor should dazzle his mind and his senses, for he made no
account of such masks, and that no elevation in the world could intercept the
course of prophetic truth. In a word, Jeremiah is here encouraged to persevere,
lest the high position of the king should terrify him, or enervate his mind, so
as not to declare faithfully the commands of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A twofold admonition may be hence gathered. The first
belongs to kings, and to those who are great in wealth or power on the earth;
they are warned to submit reverently to God&#8217;s word, and not to think
themselves exempted from what is common to all, or absolved, on account of their
dignity, for God has no respect of persons. The other admonition belongs to
teachers, and that is, that they are, with closed eyes, to do whatever God
commands them, without shewing any respect of persons; and thus they are to fear
no offenses,<i> </i>nor even the name of a king, nor a drawn sword, nor any
dangers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The crime is in the first place mentioned,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast burnt the book, saying,
Why hast thou written in it, By coming come shall the king of Babylon, and shall
destroy this city</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here God shews what
especially was the reason why Jehoiakim cast the book into the fire, even
because he could not endure the free reproofs and the threatenings contained in
it. When God spares hypocrites, or does not touch their vices, they can bear
prophetic teaching; but when the sore is touched, immediately they become angry;
and this was the continual contest which God&#8217;s Prophets had with the
ungodly: for if they had flattered them and spoken smooth words to them, if they
had always promised something joyful and prosperous to the ungodly, they would
have been received with great favor and applause; but the word of God was
unpleasant and bitter; and it exasperated their minds when they heard that God
was displeased and angry with them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage then ought to be carefully noticed; for
the Spirit of God points out, as by the finger, the fountain of all contumacy,
even because<i> </i>hypocrites wish to agree or to make a covenant with God,
that he should not deal severely with them, and that his Prophets should only
speak smoothly. But it is necessary that God&#8217;s word should correspond with
the nature of its author. For, as God knows the heart, he penetrates into the
inmost recesses;<i> </i>and so also his word is a two-edged sword, and thus it
pierces men even to the very marrow, and discerns between the thoughts and the
affections, as the Apostle teaches us.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;580412&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
4:12) Hence it is, that hypocrites become mad, when God summons them to
judgment. When any one handles gently a man full of ulcers, there is no sign of
uneasiness given; but when a surgeon presses the ulcers, then he becomes
irritated, and then also comes out what was before hidden. Similar is the case
with hypocrites; for as it has been said, they do not clamor against God, nor
even make any complaints, when the simple truth is declared; but when they are
urged with reproofs and with threatenings, then their rage is kindled, then they
manifest in every way their virulence. And this is set forth here, when the
Prophet says, that the book was <i>burnt, </i>because it was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>written in it
</i></font><font face="Palatino">that the king of Babylon would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>come to destroy
</i></font><font face="Palatino">or lay waste the <i>land, </i>and to remove
from it both </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>man and
beast</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So we see that the prophecy of Micah exasperated all
the Jews,<i> </i>when he said that Jerusalem would be reduced into heaps of
stones.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;330312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Micah
3:12)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet immediately shows that the ungodly in
vain resist God, when they kick against the goad; they must necessarily<i>
</i>be torn in pieces by the stone with which they contend, because their
hardness cannot hinder God from executing his judgments. It is therefore added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith Jehovah of the king
Jehoiakim, Be shall have no one to succeed him on the throne of
David</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By saying, that he should have no
successor, he means that he should have none of his own posterity; for though
his son Jeconiah was made king in his stead, yet as he reigned only for three
months, this short time was not counted. Then Jeremiah declares, by God&#8217;s
cmnmand, that King Jehoiakim should not have a legitimate successor, for his son
Jeconiah was led into exile at the end of three months; and Zedekiah was not
counted as a legitimate successor, because he was the uncle. And there is also
no doubt but that Nebuchadnezzar, from ill-will and hatred, set him on the
throne, for he thus raised him in order to degrade Jehoiakim and
Jeconiah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive in what sense God threatened
that there would be none to succeed King Jehoiakim; for it is not simply said,
&#8220;There shall be none to sit on the throne of David;&#8221; but,
&#8220;There<i> </i>shall be none to him,&#8221;
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wl hyhy
al</font><font face="Palatino"> <i>la</i> <i>ieie lu, </i>that is,
&#8220;There<i> </i>shall be none of his children, or of his offspring, to
succeed him on the throne of David.&#8221; For the last king was Zedekiah, and
he, as I have said, was the uncle; so that the whole royal seed were cast off,
for no one after this time ever succeeded to the throne.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be asked, How can this prophecy agree with
the promise, that the posterity of David should continue as long as the sun and
moon shone as faithful witnesses in the heavens? (Psalm 139:37, 38) God had
promised that the kingdom of David should be perpetual, and that there would be
some of his posterity to rule as long as the sun and moon shone in the heavens;
but what does our Prophet mean now, when he says, that there shall not be a
successor? This is, indeed, to be confined to the posterity of Jehoiakim; but
yet we must bear in mind what we have seen elsewhere, and that is, that he
speaks here of an interruption, which is not inconsistent with perpetuity; for
the perpetuity of the kingdom, promised to David, was such, that it was to fall
and to be trodden under foot for a time, but that at length a stem from
Jesse&#8217;s root would rise, and that Christ, the only true and eternal David,
would so reign, that his kingdom should have no end. When, therefore, the
Prophets say, that there would be none to sit on David&#8217;s throne, they do
not mean this strictly, but they thus refer only to that temporary punishment by
which the throne was so overturned, that God at length would, in his own time,
restore it, according to what Amos says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;For come shall the
time when God shall raise up the fallen tabernacle of David.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;300911&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Amos
9:11)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive in what sense hath stood firm the
promise respecting the perpetuity of the kingdom, and that the kingdom had yet
ceased for a time, that is, until Christ came, on whose head was placed the
diadem, or the royal crown, as Ezekiel says.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;262126&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
21:26) There is yet no doubt but this great inconsistency was made an objection
to Jeremiah:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;What!<i> </i>can
it be that the throne of David should be without a legitimate heir? Canst thou
draw down the sun and moon from the heavens?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In like manner, when the Prophets spoke of the
destruction of Jerusalem, they said:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;What!<i> </i>Is it
not said, &#8216;This is my rest for ever, here will I dwell?&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19C301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
123:14)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Can it be that God will be without his habitation on
earth, especially when he calls it his rest?&#8221;<i> </i>But the answer to all
this was not difficult, even that God remained faithful to his promises, though
his favor was, for a time, as it were, under a cloud, so that the dreadful
desolation both of the city and of the kingdom might be an example to
all.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is no doubt, then, but that they shewed to the
Prophet that the kingdom would be hid, as though it were a treasure concealed in
the earth, and that still the time would come when God would again choose both
the city and the kingdom, and restore them to their pristine dignity, as the
Papists say, who boast in high terms of everything said in Scripture respecting
the perpetual preservation of the Church:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Christ promises to
be with his people to the end of the world, that he will be where two or three
meet together in his name, that the Church is the pillar and ground of the
truth.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402820&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
28:20; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540315&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Timothy 3:15)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They heap together all these things, in order to shew
that God is in a manner tied and bound to them. But we can easily dissipate
these frivolous objections; for God does wonderfully and invisibly preserve his
Church in the world; and then the outward face of the Church does not always
appear, but it is sometimes hid, and afterwards it emerges and recovers its own
dignity, which, for a time, might seem to have been extinguished. Hence we give
now the same answer to the Papists as the Prophets formerly did to the ancient
people, &#8212; that God is a faithful preserver of his Church, but not
according to the perception of the flesh, for the Church is in a wonderful
manner sustained by God, and not in a common way, or as they say, according to
the usual order of things.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dead body of Jehoiakim would be
cast out, to </i></font><font face="Palatino">be exposed to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the cold in the
night</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the heat in the
day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This might seem unimportant, like
what we threaten children with, when we mention some phantoms to them; for what
harm could it have been to Jehoiakim to have his dead body exposed to the cold
in the night? for no injury or feeling of sorrow can happen to a dead body, as a
dead man as to his body can have no feeling. It seems then that it is to little
purpose that the Prophet says, that his dead body would be exposed to the heat
in the day, and to the cold at night. But this is to be referred to the common
law of nature, of which we have spoken elsewhere; for it is a sad and
disgraceful thing, nay, a horrid spectacle, when we see men unburied; and the
duty of burying the dead has from the beginning been acknowledged, and burial is
an evidence of a future resurrection, as it has been before stated. When,
therefore, the body of man lies unburied, all men shun and dread the sight; and
then when the body gets rigid through cold, and becomes putrid through the heat
of the day, the indignity becomes still greater. God then intended to set forth
the degradation that awaited Jehoiakim, not that any hurt could be done to him
when his body was cast out, and not honored with a burial, but that it would be
an evidence of God&#8217;s vengeance, when a king was thus cast out as an ass or
a dog, according to what we have seen elsewhere, &#8220;With the burial of an
ass shall he be buried,&#8221; that is, he will be deemed unworthy of common
honor; for as it falls to the lot of the lowest of men to find a pit where their
bodies lie buried, it was a rare and unusual proof of God&#8217;s vengeance,
that a king should he exposed as a prey to birds and wild beasts. We know what
Jehu said of Jezebel,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Let her be buried,
for she is a king&#8217;s
daughter.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;120934&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Kings 9:34)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">She was worthy to be torn to pieces a hundred times.
She had been cast out from a chamber, and the dogs licked her blood; yet an
enemy ordered her to be buried &#8212; and why? because she was a king&#8217;s
daughter, or descended from a royal family,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;112123&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 21:23:) then, he said, let her be buried.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand the meaning of the Prophet, or
rather of the Holy Spirit, that it would be a remarkable proof of God&#8217;s
vengeance, when the body of King Jehoialdm should be exposed at night to the
cold, and in the day to the heat. This has also happened sometimes to the
saints, as we have before said; but it was a temporal punishment common to the
good and to the bad. We ought yet always to consider it as God&#8217;s judgment.
When a godly man is left without burial, we must know that all things happen for
good to God&#8217;s children, according to what Paul says, whether it be life or
death, it is for their salvation.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450828&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:28) But when God gives a remarkable proof of his wrath against an ungodly man,
our eyes ought to be opened; for it is not right to be blind to the manifest
judgments of God; for it is not in vain that Paul reminds us that God&#8217;s
judgment will come on the ungodly; but he would have us carefully to consider
how God punishes the reprobate in life and in death and even after death. It

<div><font face="Palatino">Here a reason is given for what the former verse
contains; for if the Prophet had only said, that the dead body of the king would
remain unburied and cast out in dishonor to be exposed in the night to the cold
and in the day to the heat, the narrative would not have produced the effect
intended; but God shews here the cause, which was this, that he had forewarned
King Jehoiakim and all his counsellors, (called here servants)and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, and all the Jews universally: as then they had been<i>
</i>in due time clearly told what calamity was near at hand, and yet no one had
repented, for this so great an obstinacy God says now that he would take
vengeance, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will visit him and
his seed and the whole people for their
iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> &#8212; </i>what was the iniquity?

returned to a sound mind, though reproved by the Prophet, but had become more
and more hardened.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The extremity of their iniquity the Prophet thus
points out, because they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hearkened not

endeavored to rescue them from the coming ruin: for there would have been some
hope of deliverance, had they deprecated God&#8217;s wrath; but as his

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet tells us that he faithfully obeyed
God in writing another volume; and his constancy in this affair deserves no
common praise; for he had lately fled in fear, he knew that the king was his
enemy, as he had already ordered him and Baruch to be slain. As then he knew
that the king burned with so much rage and hatred, how came he to be so bold as
to exasperate him still more? But we see that the Prophets were not exempt from
the influence of fear, and were often anxious about their own safety; and yet
they ever preferred the duty imposed on them by God to their own life. The
Prophet, no doubt, trembled, but as he felt bound to obey God&#8217;s command,
he disregarded his own life, when he had to make the choice, whether to refuse
the burden laid on him, or to provide for his own safety. Thus then he offered
his own life as a sacrifice, though he was not free from fear and other
infirmities. This is one thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But Baruch, I doubt not, again proclaimed these
words; how was it then that the king abstained from cruelty? Had his madness
been by any means mitigated? It is certain that he did not become changed, and
that he did not through kindness spare God&#8217;s servants; but God restrained
his cruelty; for when it is not his will to soften the hearts of the ungodly, he
yet bridles their violence, so that they either dare not, or cannot find the
way, to execute with their hands what they have intended in their minds, however
much they may strive to do so. I therefore consider that the King Jehoiakim was

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet tells us here, that after Jeconiah the
king had been led into exile, the Jews had not on that account repented, though
God had as it were forced them to return to him; for it was so severe a
chastisement, that to become worse was an evidence of monstrous stupidity.
Jeremiah, however, says that they were not reformed by that punishment; for
Zedekiah, who had succeeded Jeconiah, rejected sound doctrine, and did not obey
the counsel of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must bear in mind the history of that time,
that we may understand the meaning of the Prophet: the Jews made Jeconiah king
in the place of his father, but in the third month the army of the king of
Babylon came. Then Jeconiah surrendered himself to them of his own accord. Now
the Prophet had said, that there would be no legitimate successor to Jehoiakim;
and this was fulfilled, though his son was set on the throne, for a three
months&#8217; reign was so unimportant that it was deemed as nothing. And when
Nebuchadnezzar saw that the people could hardly be kept in order without a king,
he made Mattaniah king, whom he called Zedekiah. And he immediately revolted to
the Egyptians and made a treaty with them, in order that he might shake off the
yoke of the king of Babylon. Hence the Prophet says, that though Zedekiah had
been taught by the example of Jehoiakim and of his nephew Jeconiah, he yet
became nothing the better, he does not shnply blame his ingratitude: it is
indeed certain that he had been severely reproved by the Prophet for having
acted<i> </i>perfidiously towards the King Nebuchadnezzar, for he ought to have
kept faith with him to the last. He feigned a reason of his own for revolting
from him; no new cause<i> </i>had occurred; but it was only that he might be
exempt from tribute, and also lest the malevolent should object to him that he
reigned by permission, and that. he was the slave of another king. As, then, he
saw that his reign would be exposed to many reproaches, except he revolted from
the king of Babylon, he made a treaty with the Egyptians. This deserved reproof:
but the Prophet speaks here generally of his obstinate wickedness, and also of
that of the whole people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>King
Zedekiah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the son of Josiah, reigned
instead of Coniah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here the word,
Jeconiah, is curtailed, as it is probable, for the sake of degrading him; and we
have seen that this has been the common opinion. He is then called Coniah by way
of reproach, when yet his full name was Jeconiah. He says that Zedekiah was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>made king by
Nebuchadnezzar</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>hence his perfidy and
ingratitude became manifest. It is added, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hearkened not to the word of
Jehovah, nor his servants, nor his people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>I have said that Zedekiah was condemned, not simply because he obeyed not
the Prophet by keeping faith with the King Nebuchadnezzar, but also because he
retained the superstitions of his fathers, and corrupted the true worship of
God, and would not be called back to the doctrine of the Law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The disobedience then, mentioned here, extended to
the whole Law of God, or to the two tables; for the Jews had then become
degenerate together with their king; they did not purely worship God, but
polluted themselves and the Temple by impious and filthy superstitious, and they
were also libidinous, avaricious, cruel, violent, and dishonest, and had thus
cast off the whole teaching of the Law. And this was a proof of strange
blindness, as they had before their eyes the calamities of the city and the
reproach to which their king had been subjected; for as we have already said,
his sons had been slain in his presence, his own eyes had been pulled out, and
he was bound with chains, after having been judged guilty of a capital offense.
Such an example ought surely to have terrified Zedekiah and all the rest, so as
to make thenl at length wise, and to seek reconciliation with God. But the
Prophet says, that they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>did not
hearken to the word of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He mentions the king, then his counsellors, and in
the third place, the whole people; as though he had said, that this madness was
found not only in the king, but also in his counsellors and in the whole
community, so that no one was excusable. He then begins with the head, even the
king himself, and shews also that his counsellots were nothing better, and
afterwards adds the common people, in whom the fault seems to have been less;
for we know that the lower orders go astray through want of wisdom and
ignorance. But the Prophet here shews that even the lowest of the people were
disobedient to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We ought to notice especially the words, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hearkened not to the word of
Jehovah which he had spoken by Jeremiah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>For he intimates, that though God did not appear from heaven, it was
sufficient to condemn the unbelieving, that he spoke by his Prophets. There was,
then, no reason why the wicked should make evasions and say, that it was not
their purpose to reject God and his doctrine, but that they only refused
deference to mortals, and would not regard the words of men as heavenly oracles.
This evasion availed them nothing, for God would have them to hearken to his
servants. Though he did not shew himself from heaven, nor addressed them in a
visible form, it was yet enough that he had once for all testified, that after
the promulgation of the Law, there would always be Prophets among the people,
and had commanded them to be reverently attended to. Nor could the Jews avail
themselves of that evasion, which the ungodly commonly resorted to, that they
could not distinguish between true and false Prophets; for if they had examined
the doctrine of Jeremiah, they would have found that it had certain marks by
which they could have easily seen that it was altogether consistent with the
Law. That they then rejected the Prophet and his heavenly doctrine, was a proof
of their obstinacy and contempt, but not through ignorance. It follows, &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah had briefly explained what was the state of
the city and the land, that though they had been already severely chastised by
God&#8217;s scourges, they yet remained obstinate in their wickedness. He now
adds, that messengers were <i>sent </i>to him by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>King
Zedekiah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>when danger arose from the
Chaldeans; and it is probable that this message came to Jeremiah when the siege
was raised, or if the siege still continued, it was at a time when the Jews, no
doubt, flattered themselves with the hope of receiving some aid, while yet they
saw that the power of the king of Babylon was very great. For though they hoped
for some help from the Egyptians, they were yet perplexed, and fear constrained
the king to send messengers to the Prophet Jeremiah. But it appears from the
answer that the Egyptians were already in arms, and had also come out for the
purpose of raising the siege, and driving the Chaldeans from Judea. We hence see
that the king was, in a measure, elated with vain confidence, seeing that the
Egyptians were coming with a strong army to assist him, and yet he was full of
anxiety, as the ungodly must ever be: while they seek to confirm themselves in a
state of security, they are still tossed here and there, for God&#8217;s
judgment is upon them. They are fearful, though they try to shake off fear.
Hence Zedekiah, though he thought that he should soon be freed from all danger,
yet could not wholly divest himself of anxiety, and therefore sent to Jeremiah:
for the ungodly are wont to seek God, but not in earnest; they wish to discharge
the outward duty, but they bring neither faith nor repentance, by which alone
access to God is opened.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But Jeremiah tells us that he was then at liberty,
coming in and going out </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>among the
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It may be that he had been in
prison, but that after the rage of the king and of the people had cooled, he
might have been set free. It is hence said that he was among the people, that is
set at liberty, and at his own disposal, so that he could safely walk through
the city; for to come and to go implies that he was free to follow his own
business. He is said to come and to go who undertakes this or that concern<i>
</i>as he pleases; for men, we know, are not engaged always in the same thing,
but do various things as necessity requires. Such, then, was the condition of
Jeremiah; he enjoyed common liberty. It is then added, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was not as yet cast into
prison</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as it happened soon after. It is
further said, that the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>army of
Pharaoh was come out from Egypt to </i></font><font face="Palatino">give aid to
the Jews, and that thus the siege was raised, for the Chaldeans went forth to
meet the Egyptians. At this time, then, Jeremiah<i> </i>received an answer from
God. It seems not, therefore, probable that the messengers were sent, when the
report spread through the city of the coming of the enemy, but rather when the
city was relieved, for the condition of the people was still doubtful, as the
liberty of the city<i> </i>and the land depended on the uncertain issue of the
war. The Chaldeans had not yet come unto an engagement with the Egyptians. A
victory gained by Pharaoh would have given the prospect of peace and safety to
Zedekiah and the whole people; but if the Chaldeans gained the day, they saw
that the greatest danger was at hand, for they would then be deprived of every
assistance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was in this state of things that Zedekiah sent
messengers to Jeremiah, to solicit his prayers. Thus we see that hypocrites are
driven by the fear of God, whom yet they proudly despise, to seek his aid when
forced to do so; nor is this done, that they may appear to do so before men, but
because God brings them to such straits, that they cannot but feel that they
stand in need of his help. They wish, indeed, as I have said, to obliterate
every recollection of God, and were they also able to do so, they would rob him
of all power and authority; but as they are forced, willing or unwilling, to
know that God so reigns in heaven that the whole world is subject to his power,
necessity constrains them formally to pray, and, in a manner, to conciliate his
favor, or, at least, to try to do so. But as I have already said, they ought to
begin with repentance and faith. Hypocrites withdraw themselves as far as they
can, both from the promises of God and from the duty of repentance. They so seek
God that they at the same time shun him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must also observe, that Zedekiah felt himself so
guilty, that he could not pray himself. As, then, he was conscious of his own
unworthiness, he put the Prophet, as it were, between himself and God, that he
might suppliantly intercede for him. This also is what the faithful often do,
for they seek aid here and there that they may be more readily heard by God; and
this they do according to God&#8217;s command. But there is a great difference
between the godly and hypocrites. The true worshippers of God, as I have said,
are not content with their own prayers, but ask others to join them, while, at
the same time, they pray God themselves. But hypocrites, what do they do? As
they think that an access is forbidden them, and know that they are unworthy of
being heard by God, they substitute others in their place to pray for them. Thus
they do not seek themselves to know whether God will be propitious to them; and
though they wish the whole world to pray for them, they do not yet pray
themselves. Such, then, was the sottishhess of Zedekiah, who asked the holy
Prophet to pray for him to God, while he himself was lying torpid in his own
dregs; for he did not acknowledge that he was suffering a just punishment, nor
had he recourse to the true remedy, that is, to return to God&#8217;s favor, to
embrace his mercy and the promises of salvation. All these principal things he
omitted, and only attended to what is, as they say, accessory.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now as to the time, we ought carefully to notice that
it was when the Egyptians came to raise the siege. Thus God for a time permitted
hypocrites to be deceived by a fortunate event; for the Jews then began to
praise their own prudence in forming a league with the Egyptians, for that
kingdom, as it is well known, was powerful, and at the same time populous, so
that a large army could be raised. As, then, they saw that their treaty turned
out beneficially to them, they, no doubt, assumed to themselves great credit,
and thus their boldness increased. But God, however, so touched their liearts,
that they continued in suspense, and, by turns, greatly feared: for Zedekiah
would not have sent to Jeremiah, except, constrained by some great necessity;
and yet, as it has been said, success might have inebriated him; but God
rendered him anxious, so as to feel that the prayer of the Prophet was
needed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now follows the answer: Jeremiah says that the word
of Jehovah came to him, and that he was to tell the messengers of Zedekiah, that
the Chaldeans would shortly return. He then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold the army of Pharaoh, which
has come forth to deliver you, shall return to their own
land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, being compelled to do so,
the Egyptians being either conquered in battle or smitten with fear, and
returning of their own accord to secure themselves in their own cities. The
Prophet says, that no advantage could be expected from the Egyptians, for the
soldiers of Pharaoh would return to their own land; and then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and the Chaldeans shall return
and fight against this city, until they take and burn
it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This was a hard answer, and Zedekiah
was, no doubt, greatly exasperated at hearing the message, and also very angry
with the Prophet, who thus dared plainly to threaten the city and the people
with final ruin. But here the Prophet disregarded the pride of the king, for it
was necessary for him to obey God&#8217;s command, he therefore boldly performed
his office; and, at the same time, he touched the king Zedekiah to the quick,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>say to the king who sent you to
inquire of me</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;rd</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>daresh, </i>means indeed to ask in general, but the Prophet means here that
he was to inquire; and yet this was not said before; for he only told us that
messengers had been sent to ask him to pray for the safety of the king and the
people. But Scripture, we know, often omits one of the two things that are
included; and we may easily conclude, that the king had not only sent to
Jeremiah to pray, but also to bring some favorable prophecy from the Lord. For
why did he apply to him rather than to the chief priest or some others, except
that he knew him to be the true Prophet of God? Then Zedekiah requested Jeremiah
to pray, but he tried also to draw from him some favorable prophecy, by which he
might be relieved. Hence Jeremiah indirectly reproved him, because he feignedly
sent to him as though he was ready to hear whatever God might declare by the
mouth of his servant, &#8212; &#8220;He sent you to inquire of me; he is
mistaken, for he will not get what he seeks; for thus saith God, &#8216;The
Egyptians shall avail you nothing, and the Chaldeans shall return and take and
burn the city.&#8217;&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive that when hypocrites pretend in a
circuitous way to seek God, they do not obtain what they wish; for God justly
disappoints them, inasmuch as they do not come to him with sincere hearts and
desires; for they wish to transform God into their own nature and character, and
they bend not themselves to his service nor submit to his word. Thus it comes
that God will not answer their prayers; but the faithful, who seek God sincerely
and from the heart, always find him propitious; and though he may not hear them
immediately, yet he really shews that he cares for their safety. But hypocrites,
whose confidence God regards with disdain, deserve that it should be empty and
vain. This, then, is the reason why the Prophet gave such a severe answer to
Zedekiah and his messengers. It now follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet confirms the former verse, and it was
indeed necessary that this should be added, for though Zedekiah might not have
divested himself of all anxiety and fear, he must yet have been moved by that
prophecy, and thus he might have become more hardened in his obduracy, as it is
the case with hypocrites; who, when they find that they can gain nothing, become
furious against God, and run on headlong in their course. This might then have
been the case with Zedekiah and also the Jews; hence Jeremiah adds, by way of

is, on account of the report respecting the Egyptian army. Thus he told the Jews
that they had no reason to expect any alleviation. And the reason is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For
if</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye had smitten, the Chaldeans
</i></font><font face="Palatino">so that few remained,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>yet they would rise up every one
from his tent, and burn this
city</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet shews how foolishly and absurdly the Jews
acted, in casting their eyes on fortunate events, and thus forming their
opinions. He therefore exhorts them to cease to rely on such a confidence as
would deceive them; for he says, that though they gained many battles, and the
war turned on their side, yet they could not escape final ruin, for they had to
do with God. It was hence the same thing, as though he had said, that they were
not to judge by their state at that time, as to what it would be, because God
was at war with them; and therefore if God had resolved to destroy them, though
there were no enemy, yet he could by one breath slay them all. And for the same
reason he concludes that he could employ the Chaldeans,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Though few in number remained,
and even wounded</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>yet riley would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rise up from their
tents</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and set the buildings of
Jerusalem on fire. This city, therefore, shall be burnt; ask not by whom or
when: God will in this work employ the Chaldeans, for he hath so
determined.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may hence conclude, that the Jews had been for a
time victorious, at least had successfully repelled their enemies in their
attacks on the city; for the Prophet would not have said this, had he not seen
that the Jews entertained hope of deliverance on account of some success<i>
</i>they had in the war. He therefore says, that all this was of no importance,
for their city was to perish by fire. But the principle which I have mentioned
must be borne in mind, for Jeremiah took it as granted that the destruction of
the city Jerusalem was not to be effected by the forces of the King
Nebuchadnezzar, neither by the power or number of his army, nor by the valor of
his soldiers, but by the judgment of God. Since<i> </i>it is so, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>though few remained, and they
wounded</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>even lying as half dead,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>yet they will rise up every one
from his tent</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, not together,
nor in a regular order, nor under a banner, as soldiers are wont to do, but each
one, though no comrade were near, though scattered here and there, would yet
rise up from his tent. He intimates, in short, that though the contest were only
with shadows, they yet could not escape that extreme vengeance which God had
threatened. Hence he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they
shall rise up every one from his tent, and burn this
city</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now he says not that the Chaldeans would take
possession of the city, he speaks not of the assault, but only of the burning,
he hence intimates, that though the Chaldeans might have in themselves no power
to hurt them, yet it was sufficient that they were armed by God, for the purpose
of setting fire to the houses, like women and children, who often burn whole
cities and villages; for in this case there is no need of valor or of any great
skill. So then God declares, that though the Chaldeans might not be prepared to
fight, yet they were strong enough, yea, even though they were lying down and
half-dead after having been wounded. This is the meaning.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Jeremiah tells us how, and on what occaision, he
was cast into prison. He had said shortly before, that he was in the middle of
the people, or among them; but now he gives an account of the cruelty of the
princes, that they not only cast him into prison, but even into a grave, for
they put him, as we shall see, in a dungeon, so that it was a miracle that he
did not die there; and this was not done only once; but we shall hereafter see,
before the end of the chapter, that he was unhumanly treated, so that he was
afraid to return to the same place, lest it should prove fatal to him. He
mentions the time when this was done, that is, when the Chaldean army went forth
to meet the Egyptians. He was then free to leave the city: no one before could
have gone out, because the gates were closed, and the city was also surrounded
by enemies. It was then, he says, that he went out, that he might go to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the land of
Benjamin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>where, as it has elsewhere
appeared, he was born.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he then adds, that he was intercepted by the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prefect of the ward in the gate
of Benjamin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>That gate had its name from
its situation, for a part of Jerusalem belonged to the tribe of Benjamin; and
hence it was not strange that the gate which led to the heritage of the tribe of
Benjamin was so called. There then was Jeremiah intercepted by Irijah, the
prefect of the ward, and not without a grievous charge, that he was escaping to
the Chaldeans. The Prophet attempted to clear himself, but with no effect; for
an opinion had prevailed, that he was already in league with the enemies. He
thus gained nothing by defending himself, but was taken to the princes, the
king&#8217;s counsellors.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage teaches us that God&#8217;s servants
cannot escape without being exposed to many calumnies and false suspicions.
Jeremiah might at the beginning have evaded this, and according to the
perception of the flesh, his exemption or immunity might have been viewed as
lawful, for there was now before his eyes the danger, not only of losing his
life, but also of his name and reputation, which, to ingenuous and wise men, is
of much more value. Had Jeremiah then chosen to evade, he might have made this
pretense, &#8212; &#8220;I am indeed ready to offer my life as a sacrifice a
hundred times, but what will it avail me, if I am to be regarded as a
revolter?&#8221; For he must have thus exposed the very name of God to many
blasphemies: they might have said,&#8221; This is the Prophet who boasted that
he had been sent from above, but he is now become perfidious and a traitor to
his own countw, and has tried to deliver up the city into the hands of
enemies.&#8221; Jeremiah then might have shaken off this burden laid on him; but
it was nccessary for him to bear this reproach, with which he was falsely
charged. Faithful teachers ought indeed to remove, as far as they can, all
calumnies, and to check the wicked and malicious, so that they may not have the
occasion to speak evil; but when they have done all, they will not yet exempt
themselves from calumny; for their words and their deeds will be misconstrued.
Thus Jeremiah was loaded with false charges; for all had persuaded themselves,
that as he had so much extolled the power of King Nebuchadnezzar, he had been
hired by him for the purpose of depressing the people by fear; and it may be
that the violent among them did wilfully and knowingly make his case to appear
worse to the ignorant, even by false reports. As then this conviction respecting
him prevailed everywhere, he was apprehended as a revolter, as he was going out
of the city.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he says, that he intended to go
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>into the land of
Benjamin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>so as to <i>separate
</i>himself. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qlj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chelak, </i>means to divide, to scatter, to dissipate; and hence some have
given this meaning, that he went into the land of Benjamin in order to divide
his heritage; but this seems harsh and forced. They add, &#8220;In the midst of
the people,&#8221; as though Jeremiah wished to make his land common, and to
give it to the people: but in this explanation there is nothing probable or
suitable. I therefore doubt not but that Jeremiah sought this as a quiet place,
as it is understood by most interpreters, he then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>went forth towards the land of
Benjamin, that he might separate himself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>that is, that he might be secluded there in the midst of his people. It is,
indeed, a brief mode of speaking, but the meaning is not
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ambiguous, &#8212; that he might
be there</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>where he might separate
himself from the people, as the places were distant from one
another.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fF107</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For he was tired with the city, because
he saw that he spent his labor in vain. Some think that he was afraid of being
cast into prison, because he had just announced a command greatly disliked; but
it is more probable that, he was worn out with weariness, because he saw that he
made no impression on men so hard and refractory. Hence then it was, that he
wished to withdraw from the presence of the whole people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then follows what we have already mentioned, that he
was </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>taken in the gate by the
keeper Irijah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as though he were
revolting to the Chaldeans. We have stated how this suspicion arose, even
because he had faithfillly proclaimed the commands of God. We hence see how God
tried his servant, when he thus constrained him to speak, so that his words
became suspected. And hence also we may gather how thoroughly fixed in the minds
of men was that false opinion, for Jeremiah was not heard in his own defense. He
indeed said openly that he was not fleeing away, nay, that this was a false
charge. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It is a
lie</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am not fleeing to the
Chaldeans</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I have already reminded you that the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lpn</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>nuphal, </i>found here, means properly to fall, but it is to be taken here
metaphorically, as signifying to fall away, or to incline to another side.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fallest away
</i></font><font face="Palatino">or inclinest
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the
Chaldeans</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which was the same thing as
to revolt. We see that the Prophet was not charged with a common offense, for it
would have been the highest to forsake his own country and to pass over to the
enemies: it would have been better for him to die a hundred deaths. But, as I
have already said, the servants of God ought to be so courageous as to despise
the slanders of the unprincipled, and, when it so pleases God, to prepare
themselves for patience whenever any reproach is to be undergone, only let their
conscience be always clear before God and angels; and let also their integrity
confute all slanders, and let them disprove them too, provided there be those
who can bear to hear them: but if a defense be not always admitted, let them
patiently bear this indignity. And this also we ought to notice, that
God&#8217;s servants, though ready to clear themselves of crimes ascribed to
them, and to defend their innocence at the peril of life, are yet often repelled
and condemned unheard. This is, indeed, a great indignity; but yet as Jeremiah
met with such a treatment, it ought not at this day to appear to us unendurable
or new. It now follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Jeremiah pursues the same narrative, and shews
how unjustly he was treated, for he found no equity at the hands of the princes
any more than in the keeper of the ward. He was no doubt prepared to defend
himself before them, and sufficient proof was ready at hand, only he would have
had to speak to the deaf. But here he shews by one word that the liberty of
speaking was precluded,<i> </i>for a furious madness seized them that they would
not hear him. And here we may notice how much opposed is wrath to just and
peaceable decisions; for if we wish to be right and equitable judges,
self-government is especially necessary. When, therefore, our minds are inflamed
with anger or wrath, it is impossible that any rectitude or humanity should
prevail. So Jeremiah complains that he was oppressed, because the princes boiled
with rage, so that they suffered him not to give the explanation which he had
prepared.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>smote
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>They no doubt ordered their
servants to smite him; for it would have been more than strange, had the princes
themselves risen up to strike the Prophet with their fists, or to smite him with
their hands. It is then probable that he was smitten by their orders and at
their bidding. This is the reason, if I mistake not, why some have given this
rendering, &#8220;They caused him to be smitten.&#8221;<i> </i>But he is often
said to have killed a man, who has ordered him to be killed, while he himself
had not touched him with his finger. Even so Jeremiah was smitten by the
princes, because they had commanded him to be smitten. And this passage shews
also, as in a glass, how miserable would be the condition of God&#8217;s
servants, were he not to sustain them by the power of his Spirit. For here is a
holy Prophet overwhelmed with unjust accusations and also reproaches, and the
princes abstained not from stripes, and at last he was cast into a pit.
Whenever, then, such, a thing happens to us, let us cast our eyes on Jeremiah,
and let it not be grievous to us to follow the steps of the holy Prophet; nor
let us think it hard to endure the trials with which God was pleased to exercise
him. They </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>put

he was therefore cast into a dungeon, where there were narrow places, that, the
holy man had no space either freely to rise or to stand or to sit down, or to he
down. Then the Prophet shews that he was so confined by the straitness of the
place, that he could hardly sit or lay down or stand erect.; and he says that he

when he was confined to a narrow place, as though he was in fetters, it was a
great addition to the indignity offered to him. Since then the holy Prophet was
so atrociously treated, let us not think it strange, when the same thing at this
day is endured by God&#8217;s children, and for the same cause, even for bearing
testimony to celestial truth. When the length of time is added, it increased the
evil; for he was not retained in prison for a few days or for a month, but until
the city was taken; not indeed in that prison, for the king, as we shall
presently see, removed him into the ccurt of the prison. He was, however, the
second time cast into a filthy prison, as though he was destined to die; thence
he was afterwards removed also by the order of the king. But the Prophet says,
that he was in that dungeon many days. It now follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">From these words we learn, that King Zedekiah, though
he had not obeyed good and wise counsels, nor even God and his truth, was not
yet one of the worst, for of his own self he called the Prophet to him, and
wished to find out whether he could in any way appease God. There is here, in
short, a description given of the character of Zedekiah: he was unwilling to
submit to God and his word, and yet he was not so cruel as to become enraged
against the Prophet; nor had he wholly cast away all fear of God, all concern
for religion, and all regard for prophetic teaching. For he no doubt sent for
Jeremiah as God&#8217;s true servant, and in some degree honored him, and wished
God to be propitious to himself. But this is usually the case with hypocrites:
they would willingly be reconciled with God, but at the same time they wish to
remain free, that is, to retain their own sinful dispositions; in short, they
wish so to live as that God should give place to them, and allow them to sin as
they please. Such was Zedekiah, and yet he had not reached to the highest pitch
of impiety, for as yet he had some regard for the Prophet; nor was he so savage
and cruel as his counsellors. He then called him to himself and asked him
privately, that he might not depart, as we shall see in another place, in any
measure from his royal dignity: for he simply asked the Prophet not to speak
openly, because he would thus lose his own authority.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then <i>asked </i>him in <i>secret, </i>because he
had been perplexed. He wished indeed for some favorable answer, but he hardly
dared to hope for it; and therefore he led the Prophet to a secret place, and
asked him without any being a witness,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is
there</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a word from God?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Some explain this, as though Zedekiah had asked
whether the prophecies of Jeremiah were true, as though he had said, &#8220;What
thou hast hitherto spoken, has it come<i> </i>from God?&#8221; but this is no
suitable explanation; on the contrary, he asked, Whether the Prophet had lately
received any word from God? He wished then for some new message, and to hear
something respecting the future deliverance of the city: for he was no doubt
persuaded that Jeremiah had been hitherto discharging the office<i> </i>of a
Prophet, as it became<i> </i>him; for he did not ask him as a common man, nor
did he regard him as an impostor, but inquired whether there was a word from
God. True is what I before stated, that hypocrites always seek God&#8217;s favor
in a foolish way; for they would have God to gratify their sinful lusts, but God
cannot deny himself. Hence Zedekiah, though he shewed apparently some regard for
religion, yet foolishly asked, Whether there was a word from Jehovah? that is,
Whether any message had been lately made known to Jeremiah? He answered,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There
is</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>even this,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt be delivered into the
hand of the Chaldeans</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here we may notice the boldness of the Prophet; he
had not been broken down by all the evils he had met with, but ever faithfully
performed the office<i> </i>committed to him. He therefore answered the king
honestly, though not without danger,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt be
delivered</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>into the hands of the
Chaldeans</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>for he had hardly come<i>
</i>out of prison, where he had been buried as in a grave, and we shall see that
the prison had been to him like death; and the Prophet was not divested of
infirmity and fear, as he will presently shew; yet fear did not prevent him from
faithfully performing the office committed to him. Though the Prophet dreaded
the sufferings of the prison, though he also feared death, he yet overcame all
these feelings, and presented his life as a sacrifice, when he openly and boldly
answered the king, that the Chaldeans would shortly be conquerors, and make him
a captive. Then follows the expostulation which the Prophet made to the king

<div><font face="Palatino">Though the Prophet had spoken what was displeasing to
the king, he yet complains that wrong had been done to him, as he had been cast
into prison; and thus he shews that he had been unjustly condemned for having
threatened ruin to the city and destruction to the kingdom, because he was
constrained to do this by the obligations of his office. Hence the Prophet shews
that he had not sinned in this &#8212; that he had proclaimed God&#8217;s
commands, however bitter they were to the king and to the
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage deserves special notice: earthly princes
are so proud, that as soon as they order anything, they wish every dispute about
their authority to be suspended; for they will have their own ordinances to be
counted laws, and their own decrees to be sacred and authoritative; and yet we
know, that by following their own wills, they decree often what is wholly unjust
and inconsistent with everything that is reasonable. This passage then, as I
have said, deserves special notice; for Jeremiah boldly declares that he had not
sinned, because he had threatened the king, displeased his counsellors,
inveighed against the impiety of the people, and denounced utter ruin on the
city and the Temple. He then denies that in all this he had done anything wrong.
So also Daniel said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Against<i> </i>God
and the king have I not sinned,&#8221;

<div><font face="Palatino">and yet he had disregarded the king&#8217;s decree,
and firmly refused by an impious flattery to put the king in the place of God:
he however denied that he had done anything wrong against the king, because his
decree was unjust and wicked. Let us then bear in mind, that though princes may
in bear their decrees to be disregarded by us, they are yet not absolved before
God and his angels, and also that we can boldly, openly, and with a full mouth,
as they say, assert our innocence, when religion constrains us, and when it is
not lawful to obey the impious and unjust edicts of kings. He afterwards adds

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Jeremiah, taking confidence, advances to a
higher ground; for he reprobates the folly of Zedekiah, because he had given ear
to the false prophets and their flatteries. But this he did, that he might more
fully confirm his own innocence, as though he had said, &#8220;I indeed am
grievously blamed, because I threatened ruin to the city and the Temple; but
what if the Lord had constrained me to do so? and it is evident that I was
commissioned by God, and that I alleged nothing without authority; for I have
always declared what has happened, and events have proved that I was sent from
above, when I announced to you what was to be. But where are your prophets? for
they have been always flattering you; and it has happened through their
falsehoods, that ye have not returned to the right way. It was yet in your power
to be reconciled to God, when I at first warned you; and all my labor and
endeavors were for this end, that you might anticipate God&#8217;s wrath by a
willing repentance. Since then your prophets have deceived you, and the event
now clearly proves this, know, O king, that I have been sent from
above.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We thus see that Jeremiah was not so anxious about
his life, but that he always remained stedfast to his purpose; and thus he
turned not aside from making an honest profession of the truth, so as to provide
for his own safety, as they do, who are fearful and think that they act
prudently, when they are compliant and try to please men opposed to them at the
expense of truth. This was not done by Jeremiah. He had indeed a regard for his
life, as we shall now see; but he went on in the discharge of his office, and
valued the truth communicated to him from above more than hundred lives. It is
then with reference to this that he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Where are your prophets?

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse shews that Jeremiah was not destitute of
human feelings, for he, as other men, dreaded death. But yet he could so control
himself, that no fear made him to turn aside from his duty. Fear, then, did not
dishearten him, as the boldness which we have noticed was a manifest proof of
his constancy. The Prophet therefore overcame, as to his work, every anxiety and
the fear of death; and yet he did not disregard his life, but sought, as far as
he could, deliverance from his evils. He asked for some alleviation from the
king. We hence see that the Prophets were not logs of wood, nor had iron hearts;
but though subject to human feelings, yet they elevated themselves to an
invincible courage as to their work, so as to fulfill their
office.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet tells us, that God regarded the miseries
to which he had been unjustly exposed: and the king no doubt became humane
towards Jeremiah, because God turned his heart towards what was just and right.
We said, indeed, yesterday, that the king was not in disposition cruel or
sanguinary; yet he would not have been so easily eritreated by the Prophet, had
he not been influenced by the hidden working of God&#8217;s Spirit. We hence see
how God favors his servants and has regard for their infirmity when necessary.
We yet<i> </i>see also that the Prophet was not so kindly dealt with as to be
allowed to return free to his own house, but that he was removed to another
prison, where his condition was more tolerable.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He was

kekar, </i>is by some rendered &#8220;mass,&#8221;<i> </i>or lump, and means
sometimes a large loaf; but it is probable, that during so much scarcity the
Prophet had but a scanty living. He had then a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>crust
</i></font><font face="Palatino">or piece of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bread every
day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We see how mean was his food; but
God often tries his servants in this way, withholding from them all the
delicacies of this world. It is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the street of the
bakers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>by these words is meant, I
think, that it was coarse bread, not made of fine flour, such as rich men did
eat, for their mouths could not endure what was rough and course. Then
God&#8217;s holy Prophet was content with the common bread. The king and his
counsellors had their own bakers; but it is said that bread was brought to the
Prophet from a common place, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
street of the bakers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And the bread then
sold during such a scarcity was no doubt black bread. We hence see what kind of
bread it was, because it was sold for the common use of the
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus the Prophet shews, that though some relaxation
was allowed him, he was still confined in prison, and also that no meat nor any
delicacies<i> </i>were given him, but a crust of bread only. He however
commemorates the favor of God, inasmuch as in so great a scarcity he was not
without bread. He had, then, his daily bread until all provisions
failed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And hence we learn, that God often so provides for
his servants, that he appears to have forsaken them; and yet he then
especially<i> </i>takes care of them and supplies them with what is needful for
their support. Had Jeremiah been at home, he might have been<i> </i>at any time
stoned by the people; for there were not wanting those disposed to stir up
famished men against him. He might then have been every moment in danger of his
life at home. But now in prison, he was safe, and no one could do him any harm.
Besides, had he been at home, many might have robbed him, so as to leave him
nothing to preserve life; but in prison he had his daily allowance. Thus, then,
God often conducts his servants in a manner that is wonderful and beyond what we
can conceive, and in the meantime acts as the head of a family, in supplying
their wants. In short, the Prophet here intimates that he was cared for by God,
so that during the famine and scarcity among the whole people, his bread was yet
given to him, when he could not have begged it. When he could not have procured
bread for himself either by labor, or by industry, or by begging, or by money,
he shews that God took care of him so as to feed him during that
distress.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He however adds, that he was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the court of the
prison</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>in order to shew that God tried
his patience, for a prison was a place of degradation. The Prophet was exposed
to the reproaches of all; and then the princes might have often threatened him
with danger, and might have also transferred him to another place, as we shall
hereafter see. Therefore, in a measure only did God bring aid to his Prophet,
for it was not his pleasure wholly to deliver him, and yet he suffered him not
to be reduced to extremities. Now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now shews that he was again dragged from
the court of the prison to the inner part, which was dark, filthy, and like a
grave. The cause of this he states: it was because four of the princes had heard
his words. It is probable that many of the people had come there for the purpose
of hearing the Prophet, and that he, having received a message, delivered it to
every one that came to him. Though then he was shut up in prison, yet the word
of God could not be bound, as Paul says, who gloried in the fact, that though he
was in chains, yet the truth spread far and wide.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;550209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 2:9.) Such was the case as to Jeremiah; though he was retained as a
prisoner, he yet ceased not to discharge his office; and yet there is no doubt
but that the purpose of the king was in this way to restrain him. The prison
was, as it were, the captivity of prophetic truth. But the king and his
counselors were mistaken; for Jeremiah was not less free in the court of the
prison, than if he had walked through the city all the day, nay, he had many
heralds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the four princes mentioned here watched him, even
<i>Shephatiah, Gadaliah, Jucal, </i>and <i>Pashur. </i>Then the four princes he
names, having insidiously watched what he said, immediately made a commotion.
They had, no doubt, contrived the ruin of the Prophet before they came to the
king; for the unprincipled and wicked, we know, discuss matters together when
intent on mischief, and their courtly arts must be taken to the account. As,
then, the four were in authority, they must, doubtless, have influenced the
greatest part of the king&#8217;s council, and led astray easy men, or such as
were not of themselves bent on evil. The matter was at length brought before the
king; and therefore he adds, that
they</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> came to the
king</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But he first explains the
doctrine, on account of which these unprincipled men created so much ill-will to
him, and endangered his life. Hence he says that the accusation was, that he had
not only threatened with ruin all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, but that he had
also pro-raised life to all that would go out to the Chaldeans:<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every one who abides in the
city shall die by the sword, famine, or
pestilence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>but every one who goeth out
to the Chaldeans shall live</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This was
the accusation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have seen elsewhere that the Prophet had before
said the same; it was not, then, a new thing, for he had thirty years before
that time dearly pronounced the same in the Temple, and it was then written as a
prophecy and fixed to the doors of the Temple. It was, therefore, nothing new to
hear all this from the mouth of Jeremiah. But as I have already said, the king
and his couriers thought that he was so subdued by evils that he could hardly
open his mouth. In short, they thought that the holy man had, in a manner, lost
his tongue since he had been in prison. This, then, was the reason why they now
accused him so gravely to the king, and declared him worthy of death. He had
deserved death many years before, if he had now committed a capital offense. But
as I have already stated, they regarded the Prophet as having designedly
despised the king&#8217;s authority, and they were indignant because he could
not be subdued, when yet he was a prisoner and might see danger at hand every
hour. This, then, was the reason why <i>they </i>regarded as a new thing what
Jeremiah said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whosoever abides
in the city shall perish</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>etc.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to these threatenings, we have elsewhere said,
that all those who expected help from the Egyptians were willful despisers of
God; for the Prophet had often exhorted them all, quietly and submissively to
bear that temporary punishment which God had resolved to inflict on them. They
wished in their perverseness to drive to a distance God&#8217;s judgment, and
then when they saw that God was their enemy, they deemed it enough to have the
Egyptians as their friends. It was then no wonder that the Prophet allotted to
them the sword, and famine, and pestilence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whosoever passeth over to the
Chaldeans shall live</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The condition,
however, was very hard; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his
soul</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be for a
prey,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> as </i>though he had said, &#8220;He
who flees to the Chaldeans shall only save his life, but must suffer the loss of
all his property,&#8221; as when a shipwreck is dreaded, there is no one who is
not ready to save his life at the loss of all his goods; and, therefore, in
extreme danger the merchants are wont to cast into the sea all that they have,
for they prefer to escape to the harbor empty and destitute of everything, than
to perish together with their riches. It was, then, a hard condition; but the
Prophet shews that they could not otherwise escape; they were to give up their
own country, and all other things, and could only preserve their life. For this
reason he says, that their life would be for a prey to them, as when anything is
snatched from the fire, or as when one is exposed to plunder, he were content to
take something away by stealth, for otherwise, if he sought to take away many
things, he would have to contend with many enemies. The Prophet then intimates
that the Jews could not save themselves from death in any other way than by
casting away all they had, and by being solicitous only to save life. He again
repeats, <i>he shall live. </i>By this repetition he more pressingly urged them,
and with more earnestness exhorted them to save their life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then follows a confirmation,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Given up shall be this city into
the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and they shall take
it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Prophet shews the reason why he
exhorted the Jews to flee, because the city would at length be taken. This is
substantially what he says.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now the princes add,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Die let this man, because in this
manner</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or therefore, that is, on
account of his bad counsel, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he
weakens the hands of the men of war</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>etc. Here </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hand
</i></font><font face="Palatino">is to be taken for valor, for deeds are mainly
performed by the hands. Hence to loosen or weaken the hands means the same as to
render men inert, or so idle as not to move a finger. Then the princes accused
Jeremiah on this account, that he terrified the men of war and thus rendered
them listless. It was a specious charge; but the slander had nothing to support
it; for Jeremiah could not have been condemned as a public enemy to his country,
when he earnestly exhorted them to flee and gave no hope to the people, in order
they might all, despairing of deliverance, willingly surrender themselves to
their enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A question may be raised here, whether it is lawful
for a private individual to persuade subjects to violate their oath of
allegiance to their king or prince. I now call Prophets private persons; for I
have in view civil order. Jeremiah, indeed, sustained a public character, for he
was God&#8217;s Prophet; but as to the government of the city he was a private
individual, one of the people. It seems, then, that the Prophet had passed over
the limits of what is right, when he persuaded the people to revolt, for that
could not have been done without forfeiting allegiance to the king. To this I
answer, that the Prophet was invested with a special command, and that,
therefore, he did nothing presumptuously or rashly. Though, then, the people had
pledged to the end their faith to the king, yet as God had now delivered the
city to the Chaldeans, the obligation of the oath ceased; for when governments
are changed, whatever the subjects had promised is no longer binding. As, for
example, when any country has a prince, he binds the whole people to himself by
an oath, so that they may all abide in their allegiance. When any one invades
that country, the subjects incur the charge of perfidy if they come not forward
and assist their prince, as they had promised; but when a foreign enemy takes
possession of the whole land, the obligation of the oath ceases; for it is not
in the power of the people to set up princes, because it belongs to God to
change governments as he pleases. Since, then, this power belongs to God alone,
while a prince rules, the people ought resolutely to continue obedient to him,
as their legitimate prince, set over them by God. But this was not at that time
the case with the Jews; for though the Chaldeans had not yet entered the city,
yet God had declared that they were its masters. The people, then, were not to
wait until the Chaldeans broke in into the city, burnt its houses, and killed
all they met with; but it ought to have been sufficient for them that the
prediction of the Prophet was the decree or sentence of God, by which they were
given up to the Chaldeans.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The question as to Jeremiah and all others in similar
circumstances, is now answered: for when any one sees only some danger at hand,
he ought not, on that account, to persuade the people to forsake their prince;
but every one who seeks to be God&#8217;s faithful servant, will risk his own
life in the defense of his king. When called to his council, he will advise what
is useful and right; but he will not stir up commotions and tumults: on the
contrary, he would rather die a hundred times than cause the people to revolt
either by his counsels or by his influence. But the case of Jeremiah, as it has
been said, was peculiar; for God had made known his purpose as to the Chaldeans.
Hence Jeremiah did not only prudently persuade the people to do what he deemed
necessary, but he also discharged faithfully his <i>office </i>as a Prophet: nor
did he give any other counsel than what he had been commanded to give: nay, he
commanded them, by authority, to pass over to the Chaldeans, for it was
according to God&#8217;s will.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The princes, however, brought this charge against
him, that he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>weakened the
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc.; and added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In this manner he seeks not the
good of the people, when he thus speaks</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>(<i>peace </i>here is to be taken for what is good or useful,) <i>but he
seeks evil. </i>This they slanderously added, for Jeremiah, as far as he could,
consulted the public good, he wished the city to continue safe; had it been in
his power, he would have put to flight all the Chaldeans; but he could not carry
on war with God, under whose banner the Chaldeans fought. Jeremiah then sought
the good of the people, but he could not resist God, and therefore he gave way
to the divine decree: he saw no other remedy than this, that the Jews should
undergo a temporary punishment, and be chastised by an exile, so that they might
return afterwards into their own country. Had it been possible, as I have said,
he would have kept the people from every injury; but this was not now
practicable; for God had pronounced that it was all over with the kingdom and
the city, until the Jews were punished by an exile of seventy years. There was
then a second good or benefit, so that exile might be: more tolerable to the
miserable, or captivity become milder: and this good was, to come of their own
accord to King Nebuchadnezzar, and to suffer themselves to be led forth to the
Chaldeans. This was the second good.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah then, seeing that the city, the kingdom, and
the Temple were not to stand, was anxious to urge with all his might what
remained to be done, in order that the city might at least continue as it was,
while the inhabitants migrated into another land, so that afterwards they might
return to it. This was the best thing for the people, because God had determined
to drive them all into exile. It was then absurd to bring against him this
unjust charge, that he sought not the <i>good </i>of the people, but their
<i>ruin.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as we said yesterday, all the sayings and doings
of the saints have been always unjustly condemned. And if the same thing happen
to us at this day, let us patiently bear it. We also see that it has been always
objected to the Prophets and faithful teachers, as a crime, that they did not
consult the public good, as all ungodly men at this day bring the same charge
against us, especially the couriers, who take it as granted, that were anything
changed, it would be the cause of all kinds of disturbances; and hence they
think, that their religion could not possibly fall without ruin to the public
good. Hence it comes, that the free preaching of the Gospel is disliked by them,
as though it brought with it some public calamity. Therefore they call us
turbulent; and they say that we go astray through ignorance: though we are not
avowedly enemies to the public good, yet we do not understand how kingdoms are
to be governed; and hence we rashly stir up the greatest tumults. All these
reproaches we have to bear, as Jeremiah did, when, with a quiet mind, he endured
the hatred which the princes unjustly produced against him, on account of his
doctrine, which yet he had announced by God&#8217;s command, and which was
necessary for the safety of the city and people; for the Jews could not, against
God&#8217;s will, remain in their city, from which God had resolved to remove
them. When, therefore, Jeremiah saw that the city could not be defended against
the Chaldeans, even had he been the only counselor of the king, and not
God&#8217;s Prophet, what could he have advised better or more beneficial, than
to anticipate the extreme cruelty of their enemies, and at least to do all they
could, that the city might not be burnt with fire, and that the slaughter of the
people might not be universal, but that they might continue alive, with the loss
only of their property? He could not then have brought a better counsel. But, as
I have already said, nothing is deemed good or useful by the ungodly, except
liberty perversely to resist God. This was the reason why they so unjustly
accused God&#8217;s Prophet. It follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Zedekiah doubtless knew that wrong was done to the
holy Prophet; for though he wished him to remain as he was, yet he knew that the
Prophet had not threatened the people from ill-will or a hostile mind; and he
was thus conscious that he had to do with God rather than with a mortal man.
However this may have been, he knew that Jeremiah was not an enemy to the public
safety according to the charge brought by the princes. He might then have wished
to deliver the Prophet from their hands, but he submitted to their fury; for he
was divested of all regal power, and was become, as it were, a slave to his own
counselors, on whom depended the government of the kingdom.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They wrongly explain this verse, who think that the
king spoke honorably of his counselors, as though he had said, that such was
their prudence and dignity, that nothing could be denied them. They pervert the
meaning of the Prophet; for the king, on the contrary, acknowledges here, that
he was reduced to such a condition, as though he were a private individual, he,
in short, confessed that he was the servant of servants; &#8220;Now I
<i>see,&#8221; </i>he says, &#8220;that I am no king, but that ye so rule, that,
willing or unwilling, I am forced to yield to you, even in the best
cause.&#8221; There is then no doubt but that it was the bitter complaint of the
king when he said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The king can
do nothing against you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fG1</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But Zedekiah deserved this degradation: for he ought
to have been from the beginning more teachable, and to submit to God. But in the
first place, as we have seen, he had despised prophetic doctrine, and hearkened
not to the voice of God; and in the second place, he revolted perfidiously from
the Chaldean king, and became thus guilty of ingratitude, for when his nephew
was dethroned, that is, Jeconiah or Coniah, he obtained the regal power through
the favor of the king of Babylon. He had therefore been ungrateful in denying
tribute to him. But his impiety was the main cause of all evils. As then he had
been such a rebel against God, he deserved that the princes should prove rebels
to him. He then degraded himself, and deprived himself of royal authority, when
he refused submission to the word of God, and also when he denied tribute to the
king of Babylon. It was no wonder, then, that God made him subject to the
princes and counselors, who were yet his servants.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to these couriers, their arrogance was inexcusable
in daring to condemn Jeremiah; for this was to take away from the king his own
right; <i>Die let this man, </i>for he is worthy of death. Why was it that they
were not content with accusing him, without assuming also to be his sole judges?
As, then, they treated the king so disrespectfully, there is no doubt but they
were despisers of God, when they deemed as nothing the royal dignity. But as to
the king, he reaped, as I have said, the fruit of his own impiety, for he had
not given to God his due honor in embracing the truth taught by the Prophet. It
was therefore necessary, that he should be unworthily and contumeliously
treated, so that he dared not to <i>say </i>even one word in behalf of a just
and good cause. This was the reason why he said,

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah relates here how he was delivered from
death; for he could not have lived long in the mire; partly, because he must
have died through want; and partly, he must have been starved through cold and
suffocated with the filth of the dungeon. But God rescued him in a wonderful
manner through the aid of Ebedmelech, an Ethiopian. He was an alien, and this is
expressly said, that we may know, that among the king&#8217;s counselors there
was no one who resisted so great a wickedness. But there was one found, an
Ethiopian, who came to the aid of God&#8217;s Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is then implied here a comparison between an
Ethiopian, an alien, and all the Jews, who professed themselves to be the holy
seed of Abraham, who had been circumcised, and boasted loudly of God&#8217;s law
and covenant; and yet there was not one among them, who would stretch forth his
hand to the holy servant of God! It may be there were some who pitied him, but
courage was wanting; so that no one dared to open his mouth, for it was a
reproach to patronize the holy man. They, then, preferred the favor of the
ungodly to their own duty. But there was an Ethiopian so courageous, that he
dared to accuse all the king&#8217;s couriers and the other princes. There is,
then, no doubt but that the Spirit by the mouth of the Ethiopian brought a
perpetual disgrace on the king&#8217;s princes, who passed themselves as the
children of Abraham, and boasted in high terms of God&#8217;s covenant. A
similar case is represented by Christ in a parable, when he says that a Levite
and a priest passed by a wounded man and disregarded him, but that help was
brought to him by a Samaritan.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;421030&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
10:30-35.) His purpose, no doubt, was to condemn the Jews, even <i>the
</i>Levites and the priests, for their barbarity in caring nothing for the life
of a miserable man in his extremity. So also, in this place, the Ethiopian is
set forth to us as an example, for he alone had the feeling of kindness and
humanity, so as to bring help to the holy Prophet, and to rescue him, as it
were, from immediate death and the grave: but we see all the king&#8217;s
couriers either wholly torpid or influenced by the same spirit of rage and
cruelty, as to be mortal enemies to the holy man, because he freely and openly
declared to them the command of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And Jeremiah says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ebed-melech
heard</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. We may hence conclude, that
he was anxious about the safety of the holy Prophet, and that he had his friends
who watched the proceedings. It is then added, that he was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the
palace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>but that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>king was sitting in the gate of
Benjamin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for kings were wont to
administer justice in the gates, and to have there their tribunal; and it was
there that the people held their regular assemblies.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was sitting in the gate of
Benjamin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But, in the meantime, his
palace was a place of execution and the den of robbers. We hence see that the
sloth of the king is here denoted, for he apparently performed the proper office
of a king, but neglected the principal part of it, for he suffered a holy man to
be east into a pit. As, then, he thus exposed the Prophet&#8217;s life to the
will of the princes, it is evident that he was but an empty shadow, though he
stood there as the judge of the people, and had there a sacred
tribunal.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It now follows, that Ebed-melech
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>went forth from the
palace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and <i>came </i>to the
king&#8217;s tribunal, that he might there plead the cause of the Prophet. It is
right to notice this circumstance as well as the former. For if Ebedmelech had
met the king accidentally, he might have spoken to him in passing; but as he
went forth from the palace, it is clear that he had been meditating on what he
was going to do, and that he had not felt only a sudden impulse of compassion:
but that when he might have rested quietly in the palace, he came of his own
accord to the king to make known his complaint. And further, he did not address
the king in a room or in some private corner of the palace, but he spoke to him
in the gate, that is, in a public assembly. We hence see that the previous
circumstance commends to us the perseverance of this man, for he was not only
suddenly moved, but persevered in his holy purpose; and the second circumstance
commends to us his magnanimity, for he did not shun ill-will, but openly and
boldly spoke for Jeremiah before the people; and he amplified the excellency of
the Prophet by bringing an accusation against the princes. He no doubt knew that
he was bringing himself into danger, but he exposed his own life that he might
aid the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then said, that the king&#8217;s counselors had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>done wickedly in all the things
which they had done against Jeremiah the
Prophet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because they had cast him into
the well: and he added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There he
will die under himself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or as some
render it, and rightly, <i>&#8220;in </i>his own place.&#8221; But the
expression is striking, but cannot be fully expressed in our language: for
Ebedmelech meant that Jeremiah would die, though no one molested him, though no
evil or harm were done to him by another.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He
will</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>die in his own
place</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, he will die, if left
where he is; because he lay, as it has appeared, sunk in mire. And then he said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will die through
famine</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for he had been cast into the
pit as into a grave. And as scarcity prevailed among the whole people, Jeremiah
could not have hoped for any aid; and bread, as we shall hereafter see, could
not have been thrown to him. Then Ebedmelech says here first, that Jeremiah had
been unworthily treated, because he was <i>God&#8217;s Prophet; </i>for he
honors him with this title, that he might expose the impiety of the princes; and
secondly, he shews how miserably he lay in the pit, because no one could supply
him with food, and there was no more bread in the city. It now follows &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">We here see, what I have already said, that; the
Prophet&#8217;s deliverance was wholly from above. The king, smitten with fear,
had lately given over the holy Prophet to the cruelty of his princes; and had
confessed that he had no longer any authority:<i> </i>&#8220;for it is not the
king,&#8221; he said, &#8220;who now governs you.&#8221; As, then, the king had
not dared resolutely to contend against his princes:, how was it, that he now
ventured to extricate Jeremiah from the pit? We hence see that the king&#8217;s
mind had been changed; <i>because </i>he was lately so stunned with fear, that
he dared not to plead </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
cause</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of the holy man; but now he
commands the Ethiopian to</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> take
him out from the pit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It then appears
that this was over-ruled by a divine power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But let us hence learn to be courageous, when
necessity requires, though there may not be a hope of a favorable issue.
Ebedmelech might have thought within himself that his attempt would be in vain,
however strenuously he might have pleaded for Jeremiah. He might, then, have
thus relinquished that purpose which he had so boldly undertaken; for thus they
who are over-wise are often led, as it were, into inertness: &#8220;<i>What
</i>can you effect? thou art but one, and they are many; and then the thing is
done. If the king himself has been forced to yield to their fury, and thou being
a private individual, with what. confidence can you resist them? and further, a
tumult will be raised, and thou wilt perish in it; and in the meantime they will
perhaps stone with stones that unhappy man, whom thou seekest to help.&#8221;
All these things might have occurred to Ebedmelech, and thus he might have
desisted. But we see that he rested in confidence on God&#8217;s favor. Let us,
then, remembering his example, hope beyond hope, when God requires us to do a
thing, that is, when faith, the obligation of duty, demands anything from us,
and which may be done, if we close our eyes to all obstacles and go on in our
work; for events are in God&#8217;s hands alone, and they will be such as he
pleases. In the meantime it is simply our duty to proceed in our course, though
we may think that our labors will be in vain and without any fruit. Ebedmelech
happily succeeded, and how? because he performed the part of a pious and upright
man. Thus God will extend his hand to us; whatever difficulties may meet us, we
shall overcome them all by his power and aid.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then the king commanded Ebedmelech
the Ethiopian</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take hence thirty men with
thee and extricate Jeremiah from the well</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Ebedmelech might even then have relinquished his undertaking; for he might
not have been able with thirty men to overcome so great a power; for all the
king&#8217;s counselors had united together, and no doubt they had enlisted many
others. We thus see that Ebedmelech did not rely on human aid, but that being
strengthened by invincible confidence he undertook this office, so that he dared
to draw Jeremiah out of the pit. It hence follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Jeremiah goes on with the history of his
deliverance. The courage of Ebedmelech ought ever to be noticed by us, for he
went immediately to the holy Prophet. And it is said, that he <i>took </i>from
some bidden place <i>old tatters, De vieux haillons, </i>as we call them. It is
properly a noun substantive. But if its harshness be displeasing, we may give
this rendering, <i>&#8220;old </i>tatters which had been dragged, and old
tatters which were rotten.&#8221; Yet some render the words thus, &#8220;Worn<i>
</i>out clothes and rotten clothes.&#8221; But the former is more properly the
meaning; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bjs</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>sacheb, </i>means to drag, and it may be rendered in French, <i>Vieux
haillons trainez, ou, qui avoyent traine Then we </i>have

<i>salechim, corrupted </i>or marred, <i>usez; </i>for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jls</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>salech, </i>means to salt; but it is a verb in <i>Hophal, </i>and in that
form it means to corrupt. They were torn or rotten garments, <i>des vieux
haillons a demi pourris. </i>It is said then that Ebedmelech took these old,
torn, and rotten garments, and which had been used. This ought to be carefully
noticed; for it appears that Ebed-melech was afraid of the violence of the
princes, not so much on his own account, but lest he should be hindered in
effecting his purpose.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For if he had provided other things, he might have
been apprehended; report might have been brought to the princes, who would have
immediately assembled and put a stop to his efforts. There is then no doubt but
that Ebedmelech, being very confident, prudently considered what might prevent
him in his attempt of bringing help to the holy Prophet. Hence it was, that he
stealthily took from a hidden place these worn-out and marred garments. This is
one thing. Then we see the miserable state of the holy Prophet; he lay half
buried in mud, and he was to be drawn out by ropes or cords, and to have these
torn and worn-out garments under his arms. And we are afterwards expressly told
for what purpose these clothes were sent down to him.</font><br></div>

them under thine armpits underneath the cords.&#8221; This was to be done, lest
the Prophet should receive any hurt; for he was to be drawn up by the cords, and
he was fixed in the mud: and this could not have been done without lacerating
his skin and injuring his armpits, for that part, we know, is tender. Then
Ebedmelech ordered the Prophet to take these old tatters and to put them under
the cords, so that he might be drawn up by the men with the least injury. This
was the advice of Ebedmeleeh, and Jeremiah did as he was
bidden.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God thus delivered his Prophet in a wonderful manner
from death: but we hence see how miserable was his condition; for the Prophet
could not have otherwise escaped than by using these worn-out and rotten tatters
and by being drawn up by cords. There is no doubt but that he had thought of the
difficulty; for he had been there now some time; and he was not so strong that
he could trust to his own arms, and he knew that his hands were not strong
enough to hold fast the cords. But he doubtless east all his cares on God and
his providence. Though then he does but briefly tell us that he did as he was
bidden, he yet has left us to consider how much confidence he had, when he
immediately obeyed, and did not decline what he might have justly feared, that
he was feeble and weak; nor did he know whether his hands were strong enough to
hold the cords, nor how the cords were to be applied to his shoulders. He
therefore did what Ebedmelech had told him, for he knew that the advice came
from God. It afterwards follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">We here see that the Prophet was rescued from death,
not however that he might be set at liberty, and sent home, for that would not
have been for his benefit, as he would have been taken again by the king&#8217;s
counselors. Ebedmelech could not, therefore, save his life otherwise than by
having him confined in another part of the prison. He could have wished, no
doubt, to have him as a guest in his own house: he doubtless wished to do for
him more than he did. But his prudence deserves to be commended, that he placed
the Prophet again in prison; for otherwise the fury and cruelty of the princes
could not have been mitigated. Then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jeremiah dwelt in the court of
the prison.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He was evidently led there by Ebedmelech. If one were
to object and say that this was a proof of too much timidity; to this the answer
is, that Ebedmelech was not fearful on his own account, but because he saw that
he had to do with wild beasts; and he saw that their rage could not otherwise be
calmed than by having Jeremiah confined in the prison. Indeed, the whole city
was then like a prison, as it is well known; for they were oppressed everywhere
with want, and no one could hardly go out of his house. This state of things was
then wisely considered by Ebedmelech, for he had not only his own business to
attend to, but he also labored to preserve God&#8217;s Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When God at any time relieves our miseries, and yet
does not wholly free us from them at once, let us bear them patiently, and call
to mind this example of Jeremiah. God, indeed, manifested his power in
delivering him, and yet it was his will that he should continue in prison: even
thus he effects his work by degrees. If then the full splendor of God&#8217;s
grace does not shine on us, or if our deliverance is not as yet fully granted,
let us allow God to proceed by little and little; and the least alleviation
ought to be sufficient for comfort, resignation, and patience. It now follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">Here is added another narrative, &#8212; that King
Zedekiah again sent for Jeremiah to come to him in the Temple, that is, in the
court of the Temple; for it was not lawful for the king to enter into the
Sanctuary, and the court is often called the Temple. But there were, as it is
well known, many entrances. The largest gate was towards the east, but there
were gates on the other sides. The court also had several parts, separated from
each other. Then Zedekiah, that he might speak privately to Jeremiah, came to
the third entrance of the court, and there he asked the Prophet faithfully to
explain to him what he had received from God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is no doubt but that Zedekiah in course of time
entertained a higher regard for Jeremiah as God&#8217;s faithful servant. Yet he
was not, as we have said, really attentive to the teaching of the Prophet. Hence
the mind of the king was in a dubious state, like those hypocrites, who, having
some seed of God&#8217;s fear remaining in them, fluctuate and continually
change, and have nothing solid and fixed. They dare not, indeed, to despise
either God or his servants; nay, they acknowledge that they are under
God&#8217;s authority, and that his word is not evanescent; and yet they make
evasions as much as they can, and seek to change, as it were, the nature of God.
Such was the character of Zedekiah. For he was not one of those who grossly and
openly despise God, as we see at this day, the world being full of Epicureans,
who regard religion as a fable. Such, then, was not Zedekiah, but he retained
some fear of God; nay, he even shewed regard for the Prophet; and yet he was
unwilling to submit to God, and to follow the counsels of the Prophet. He was,
therefore, suspended, as it were, between two opinions. But it is probable that
he entertained some hope, because he had saved the life of Jeremiah. he might,
then, have thought that God was pacified, or that he would remit in some degree
his severity, as hypocrites always flatter themselves. For if they do the least
thing, they think that they merit some favor, I know not what, at God&#8217;s
hand. Hence Zedekiah, when he had relieved the holy Prophet, and fed him during
the greatest scarcity, thought that this service was acceptable to God; and it
was in part acceptable; but he was mistaken in thinking this to be a kind of
expiation. Hence then it was that he sent for the Prophet; he expected some
favorable answer, even that God&#8217;s wrath was pacified, or at least
mitigated. But we must defer the rest till to-morrow.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">THE Prophet seems here to have acted not very
discreetly; for when he ought of his own accord to have announced to the king
the destruction of the city, being asked he refused to answer, or at least he
took care of his life, and secured himself from danger before he littered a
word. And the Prophets, we know, disregarding their own life, ought to have
preferred to it the commands of God, as we find was often the case with
Jeremiah, who frequently at the risk of his life proclaimed prophecies
calculated to rouse the hatred of all the people, and to create the greatest
danger to himself. It seems, then, that he had made no good progress, since he
now fails, as it were, in this hazardous act of his vocation, and dares not to
expose himself to danger.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it ought to be observed, that the Prophets had
not always an express command to speak. For had God bidden Jeremiah to declare
what we shall hereafter meet with, he would not have evaded the question; for he
had been so trained up for a long time, that he feared not for himself so as to
turn aside from the straight course of his office. That he now, then, seems to
draw back, this he did because God had not as yet commanded him to explain to
the king what we shall presently see. For he would have done this without
benefit: and he had often admonished the king, and had seen that his counsel was
despised. No wonder, then, that he was unwilling to endanger his life without
any prospect of doing good. If any one brings this objection, that it is then
lawful for us to do the same; to this I answer, that we are not thoughtlessly to
cast pearls before swine; but until we try every means, we ought to hope for the
best, and therefore to act confidently. But Jeremiah had fully performed his
duty: for the king could not have pleaded mistake or ignorance, since the
Prophet had so often testified that there was no other remedy for the evil but
to pass over to the Chaldeans.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As then the Prophet had so often warned the king, he
might now be silent, and thus excuse himself, &#8220;Thou
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wilt kill
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and at the same
time</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> thou wilt not believe
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, thou wilt not obey, if I give
thee counsel.&#8221; These two clauses ought to be read together; for if
Jeremiah had seen that there was a prospect of doing good, he would doubtless
have offered his life a sacrifice. But as he saw that his doe-trine would be
useless, and that his life was in danger, he did not think it right rashly to
expose his life, when he could hope for no benefit. The Prophet then did not
regard only his own danger, but was also unwilling to expose heavenly truth to
scorn, for it had often been already despised. He then did not answer the
king&#8217;s question, because he was convinced that he would be disobedient, as
he had ever been up to that very time. It follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The king, desirous of having a new revelation,
promised safety to the Prophet by an oath. He then swore that he would not take
revenge, though he might be displeased with the Prophet&#8217;s answer he might
indeed have <i>conjectured, </i>though Jeremiah had not expressly said anything,
that the answer would be unfavorable, and by no means agreeable to his wishes.
For if some pleasant and joyful oracle had been given to the Prophet, he would
not have made a preface respecting his own danger, and the wrath of the king,
and also respecting his obstinacy. Zedekiah then could have concluded, that
nothing but what was sad could be expected. For this reason he made an oath,
that whatever might be the answer, he would not be so offended as to cause any
harm to the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will not kill thee, nor deliver
thee into the hand of those who seek thy
life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, who are enemies to thy
life: for to seek life is the same thing as to pursue man to death. It is a way
of speaking that often occurs, especially in the Psalms.

40:14, 15.) Then he refers to the mortal enemies of Jeremiah: and he promises at
the same time that he would, with undisturbed mind, receive whatever he might
hear from the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us notice the form of the oath,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Live does Jehovah, who made for
us this soul</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He first made an oath by
the life of God, that is, by the immortal God. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chi</i>, when applied to God, denotes a life different from what is in men or
in brute animals; for men live by the will of another, that is, while God gives
them life. It belongs then to God alone to live, for we do not live, nor move,
nor have any being but in him, as Paul says, in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441728&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
17:28; and hence he teaches us in another place, that God alone is immortal.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540616&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 6:16) At the same time comprehended in this word is everything that
peculiarly belongs to God; for God does not live to enjoy ease and indulge in
idleness, but to govern the universe, to exercise his power throughout heaven
and earth, to judge men, to render to every one his own just reward. Then life
in God is not an idle life, as ungodly men imagine, but includes his infinite
power, justice, wisdom, and all that peculiarly belongs to him. Whenever then we
speak of the life of God, let us know that we do not live but through him, and
also that he does not sit idly and carelessly in heaven, but that he governs the
whole world, and is the judge of men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">According to this meaning, then, Zedekiah said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Live does
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and then he added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who made for us this
soul</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He expresses more clearly what I have
already stated, and it is the same as though he had offered his own life before
God as a pledge. He then prayed for the punishment of perjury on himself; for
when he made an oath by God, the giver of life, it was the same as though he had
said, &#8220;Let my life be forfeited, if I deceive thee, or turn false.&#8221;
We hence see what is the end of an oath, even that God&#8217;s sacred name may
be for us a pledge, that our word may be relied on. It hence follows, that
God&#8217;s name, whenever we swear, cannot be taken with impunity: for we
expose our life to his judgement, that he may revenge the wrong done to him; for
his name, as it is sufficiently known, is profaned by perjuries. It now follows

<div><font face="Palatino">A question may be raised here, Whether God had again
bidden his Prophet to repeat what he had so often spoken in vain? To this we
cannot say anything certain, except that the probability is, that the Prophet
did not open his mouth without being guided by the Holy Spirit. For though he
had not received any new command, yet the Spirit of God influenced him, and
ruled his tongue as well as his heart. We shall indeed presently find, that what
was nigh at hand had been revealed to him; not what he had before, but it was
added as a new confirmation of former doctrine. But this is only a probable
conjecture; let then every one take his own view of the
question.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That he might now gain credit to his answer, he
prefaced it by saying, that he did not speak except from God&#8217;s mouth. He
had often declared this, having testified that what he said was made known to
him by God. But it is not now known whether he had been bidden to repeat the
same things; though it is certain that he did not make a wrong use of
God&#8217;s name, nor did he, without authority, assert that it was God&#8217;s
word. The Spirit, therefore, as I have said, was his guide and ruler, though we
may grant that he did not receive any divine command.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls God,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the God of hosts, and the God of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. By </i>the first title he denotes
the omnipotence of God; and by the second, the covenant which he had made with
the Jews. He then did set forth the immeasurable power of God, that he might
make Zedekiah to fear; for hypocrites, though they are constrained to dread
God&#8217;s name, yet afterwards do, in a manner, become hardened: it is
therefore necessary to rouse them, as the Prophet did here. He then touched on
the impiety of Zedekiah; for he not only professed himself to be one of
God&#8217;s elect people, but he was also the king and head; he ruled over the
heritage of the Lord. And yet he did not believe any of the prophecies. There is
therefore implied a reprobation, when the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the God of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A mitigation of punishment is added, provided
Zedekiah willingly put his neck under the yoke. And it was no common mercy from
God, that he could yet escape extreme punishment; for he was unworthy to be
regarded by God, since for some years he had not attended to what he had heard
from the mouth of Jeremiah, that he was to surrender himself, his people, and
the city to the Chaldeans. he had refused, nay, he had been refractory and
obstinate against God. We hence see, that he was unworthy of any alleviation;
and yet God was still ready to forgive him, as to his life, provided he passed
over, of his own accord, to the Chal-deans. And thus he was made more
inexcusable, inasmuch as when he heard that God would be propitious if he
submitted to due punishment, he was still unwilling to obey, as afterwards we
shall see. And thus we see that Jeremiah had not said without reason, &#8220;If
I give thee counsel, thou wilt not hear nor obey me;<i>&#8221; </i>for the event
proved this. This is one thing. Then he said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt
live</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and in the first place, he said,

that he promised impunity, but that the king might at least hope that God would

hence a threatening is added, &#8220;Except thou deliverest thyself

either by fear or by hope, to obey the advice of the Prophet. We hence see, that
though he did not avowedly despise God, he was yet neither cold nor hot, but
wished to be wholly spared. Hence then it was, that he rejected the favor
offered to him by the Prophet. However his excuse follows &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">Zedekiah seems, here
</font><tt><font face="Courier New">to </font></tt><font face="Palatino">have
had a good reason why he should not immediately obey the Prophet. And often the
best of the faithful openly set forth their anxieties, and we have seen that
even the Prophet, when any apprehension of danger was entertained, sometimes
mentioned it. It was not then a thing to be blamed, that Zedekiah ingenuously
confessed that he was prevented by the fear of those who had revolted to the
Chaldeans. For we know that subjects, having once cast off the yoke, and
violated their pledged faith, conduct themselves in an insolent way; for they
know that those to whom they have not performed their duty would be implacable
to them. Zedekiah then was justly anxious, and his simplicity in explaining to
the Prophet his fear, seemed worthy of an excuse, for he seemed to give some
sign of obedience. But the event at length will shew us, that he was so bound by
fear, that he refused the counsel of God and the Prophet. It often happens, as I
have just said, that the faithful also fear, and thus vacillate or stand still,
when God commands them anything hard and difficult, and they would willingly
withdraw from the contest, but they at length obey God, and surrender their own
thoughts, and submit in obedience to God. But Zedekiah so feared,

could not partake of God&#8217;s goodness promised to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see what the faithful have in common with

fear as well as the unbelieving; they are anxious, they vacillate, and <i>make

themselves, and become hardened in their perverse purposes; but the faithful
fight with themselves, and subject their thoughts to the will of God, and thus
overcome fear by faith; they also crucify the flesh, and give themselves up
wholly to God. We have seen the same thing before in the Prophet. But we shall
now see the obstinacy of King Zedekiah, to which we have referred. Then Zedekiah
feared lest the Jews, who had revolted to the Chaldeans, should treat him with
insolence. The Prophet thus answered him &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here again Jeremiah strengthens Zedekiah, that he
might not hesitate to make the trial, since God would yet give him pardon, so
that at least his chastisement would be paternal and light He then promised to
Zedekiah that he would be safe from all the insults about which he was anxious.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They will not deliver
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says; as though he had said,
&#8220;Leave this to God&#8217;s providence, resign thyself to God, and doubt
not but that he will keep thee safe.&#8221; God, in his kindness, as I have
said, allows the faithful to cast their cares into his bosom: but at the same
time, if any disobey, when he confirms them, it is a sign of deliberate
wickedness, and such perverseness extinguishes all the light of grace. Such was
the stupidity of Zedekiah, that he did not accept of this second promise. He
might indeed have confessed his fear, but he ought also to have received the
remedy. The Prophet assured him that his life would be safe in God&#8217;s hand;
what more could he have wished? But this was said to no purpose, because fear
fully occupied his mind, so that there was no entrance for the promise. Now this
ought to be carefully noticed; for there are none of us whom many cares do not
disturb, and many fears do not perplex; but a place ought to be given to a
remedy. God succors us when he sees us distressed by anxious thoughts; but if
fear so prevails, that all the promises by which God raises us up avail nothing,
it is a sign of hopeless unbelief.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It afterwards follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear the voice of Jehovah, which
I utter to you, that it may be well with thee, and that thy soul, may
live</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The promise is again added, to
lead Zedekiah to submit more willingly to God. For though we know that we cannot
escape his power, it will yet be dreaded by us, except he favors us with the
promises of grace. In this way, then, the Prophet endeavored to lead Zedekiah to
render obedience to God:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the voice of
Jehovah, that it may be well with thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>He shewed that it was yet in the power of Zedekiah to provide for his own
safety, if on]y he obeyed the word of God. And this passage teaches us, that the
Prophet had not spoken thoughtlessly and in vain, but under the guidance and
teaching of God&#8217;s Spirit For though it may not have been, that he had
received a new command, he yet knew that it was God&#8217;s will, that he should
confirm and reassert the previous oracles; for he did not falsely assume
God&#8217;s name, when he bade Zedekiah to hear God&#8217;s voice which he had
made known.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, though this discourse was especially directed to
Zedekiah, we may yet conclude, that it is always for our good to embrace
whatever God declares to us, though it may apparently be hard and unpleasant, as
it was to Zedekiah; for it was by no means an agreeable thing to him to deliver
up himself to his enemies, to be deprived of his regal power, to be drawn into
exile, and from a king to become a slave; and yet nothing was better for him, in
order to save his life, than to obey God. Though, then, the words of God contain
what is contrary and grievous to our flesh, yet let us feel persuaded that God
always speaks what is good for our salvation. It would then have been well for
Zedekiah, had he obeyed the counsel of the Prophet; for he would have found in
captivity that God would be propitious to him, and this would have been an
invaluable comfort; and then he might have been brought back from exile, at
least he would have preserved the city and the Temple: but by his obstinacy he
betrayed the city to his enemies, and hence it was also that the Temple was
burnt.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If thou refuse to go forth, this
is the word which God hath shewed to me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Jeremiah again declares that Zedekiah resisted in vain, because he kicked,
as it is said, against the goad, for he could not possibly escape from coming
into the hand of his enemies; which, when done, then neither the city nor the
Temple would be spared. But the Prophet repeats again, that it had been shewn to
him what to speak, he then spoke not in his own name, but by God&#8217;s
command; which, it may be, was not then given him: but the Prophet knew that
God&#8217;s decree, of which he had been the herald, could not be abolished. He
then says, that this word had been shewed to him by God, even what follows
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, the women who as yet remain

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall say, The men of thy peace

for the whole, for under one thing is included the whole calamity of the city.
We indeed know that the female sex do not stand in the ranks to fight, and that
when a city is taken, women are commonly spared. When, therefore, the Prophet
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go forth shall women who
are yet remaining in the king&#8217;s
palace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it is the same thing as if he
had said, &#8220;Even the women shall be compelled to go forth to the enemies,
and give themselves up into their power; what then will become of the men, when
such shall be the hard condition of the women?&#8221;</font><br></div>

not in the meantime so provoke thy extreme vengeance, as to find thee a rigorous

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND FIFTIETH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We, were obliged yesterday to break off where the
Prophet said to King Zedekiah that women would be his judges, and that for a
heavier reproach to him, because he refused to believe the oracles of God.
Though the Prophet had often exhorted him to repent, he had yet refused all his
admonitions. Therefore Jeremiah here declares that he would have to bear the
punishment he had deserved, even that the very women would openly speak of his
folly and of the perfidy of all the princes.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
shall</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>then <i>say,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have
persuaded</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or seduced <i>thee, </i>as
some read, and others, &#8220;have driven thee,&#8221; which I should prefer,
were it the common meaning, for it immediately follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and have prevailed over
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but we may simply take it in its
proper sense, because they had perfidiously persuaded the king.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the men of
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>from whom acts of kindness might
have been expected. We indeed know that friends and associates were thus called
by the Hebrews. Peace does not only mean unity, but what is more, even
friendship, such as ought to be between a king and his counselors. Jeremiah, no
doubt, sought in this case to try whether Zedekiah was yet capable of being
recovered; for he foretells that women would announce this as from a judicial
throne; but as I have said yesterday, and as we shall hereafter see, he spoke to
the deaf.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is then added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fixed are thy feet in the
mire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is to be taken
metaphorically. He might have secured his own life, had he passed over to the
enemy, and thus a willing surrender might have been, as it were, the price for
his liberation; but he chose rather to live in his own nest: and the Prophet
says that this torpor would be like clay, in which he would he fixed. What
follows, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>turned are they
backward</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is, in my judgment, improperly
applied to the princes. I read the words in connection with the former,

to the king contrary to what he hoped.

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah pursues the same subject; but he sets forth
at large the calamity, that the king being at least frightened with horror,
might submit to a right counsel; for when we hear that death is at hand, this
indeed fills us with horror; and when many evils are mentioned, we must
necessarily be roused; and this, no doubt, was what the Prophet looked for. Then
he says that Zedekiah would come into the hands of his enemies, hut he adds
other indignities, which would bring greater bitterness,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall draw
out</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all thy wives and thy
children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. Had Zedekiah been
right-minded, he would have preferred to die a hundred times, and thus to have
died for them all, than to have been the cause of so many evils. For we know
that many have boldly exposed themselves to danger in defending the chastity of
their wives; and doubtless such a reproach is far harder to be endured by
ingenuous minds than a hundred deaths. We hence see what was the design of the
Prophet; for he saw that Zedekiah could not be sufficiently roused by merely
setting his own death before him, hence he added other circumstances, calculated
to affect him still more, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
shall draw out</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thy wives and thy
children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence learn how conjugal fidelity was then with
impunity violated. It was, we know, an ancient evil, but it had now passed into
general practice, so that it was, as it were, the common law: and yet what God
had once established continued unchanged, even that every man should have only
his own wife. As, then, polygamy had so prevailed and had become so licentious
among the Jews, we see that the fear of God was in fact extinguished and all
regard to purity. More liberty was indeed allowed to kings, but they were not on
that account to be excused, because their life ought to have been an example to
others, a mirror of uprightness and chastity. When, therefore, they married a
number of wives, it became an intolerable evil. And now when mention is made of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all the
wives</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>we conclude that the king had not
only three or four wives or concubines, but a large number, that he might
gratify his lust. hence then we learn how great was the corruption of that age.
It is also a wonder that the king was thus given to his lusts, and not brought
back to some degree of moderation when necessity itself constrained him. We
hence see that he must have been extremely insensible in retaining so many
concubines, when his only city was hardly safe, and the whole country in the
possession of enemies. But thus perverse men despise God and his scourges. For
though all confess, according to the common proverb, that necessity is a
mistress whom all are forced to obey, yet the greater part struggle with
necessity itself, as we see was the case with Zedekiah, who refused to bend or
turn, though very poor and miserable, and who suffered nothing of his royal pomp
and splendor to be diminished. Hence it was that he had a large number of wives
or concubines, as mentioned here.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It then follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This city shalt thou burn with
fire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is certain that the torch was
not applied by Zedekiah, nor was he the agent in the burning. But the Prophet
reminded him that the cause of all the evils might justly be attributed to his
obstinacy; as though he had said, that the Chaldeans would indeed be the authors
of the burning, as they would with their own hands set the houses on fire, and
yet that the first and the chief fault would be in Zedekiah himself, because he
obstinately resisted God.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fG5</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as to the women, this brief notice must be added:
other kings, indeed, had been very dissolute; but God now applied the remedy
when the court was purged from all its old filth. For with Jeconiah, we know,
the royal dignity ceased; and the city was exposed to plunder; and yet some
concubines remained; and these passed as by hereditary right to other kings, as
they succeeded to the wives as to the kingdom. But when wickedness became
incorrigible, all the concubines were taken away also. It was then a sign of
final destruction. It follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here is seen the miserable condition of the king. Had
he no faith in the answer of Jeremiah, he would not have thus feared. But he
acknowledged that what he had heard from the mouth of the Prophet was true. In
the meanwhile he delayed and extended time as far as he could, and chose rather
to spend his life in trembling than to be immediately freed from all care and
anxiety. This was by no means to act like a king; for had he any courage, he
would not have waited to the last hour. We indeed know that men of courage
boldly meet death, when they see no hope of honor remaining. Zedekiah had lost
his authority; he held indeed the title of a king, but he was without power; for
he was compelled servilely to obey his counselors; and now he feared his own
shadow, and yet protracted time, as I have said, as much as he could; and on
this account he requested the Prophet, that this conversation might remain as

<div><font face="Palatino">Here again Zedekiah shews his anxiety, lest Jeremiah
should be apprehended, were the princes unexpectedly to assail him; for he might
in this respect have stumbled, though admonished. Then the king intimated to him
what to answer, in case the counselors came to him and made inquiry respecting
their intercourse. He then advised him simply to say, that he <i>entreated
</i>him not to send him back to the filthy pit, where he almost perished. The
miserable servitude of the king appears now still evident; for he feared his own
counselors, lest they should revolt from him. he might easily have made a
spontaneous surrender of himself, but he dared not, lest he should be killed by
them in a tumult; and yet, on the other hand, he feared lest the princes should
despise him, and so redeem themselves by the sacrifice of his
life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We see in what straits he was, but God rendered to
him a just recompense for his obstinacy. It was indeed a miserable thing to hear
that the king&#8217; was thus oppressed on every side, but the cause of all this
ought ever to be borne in mind; which was, that he had despised God and his
Prophet. He then deserved to be in this state of anxiety, to fear death on every
side, and not to be able to extricate himself from those cares and perplexities
which tormented him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us then learn to cast all our cares on God, so
that our life may be safe, and that we may have calm and tranquil minds:
otherwise what is written in the Law must necessarily happen to

28:66, 67)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Lest then the same thing happen to us as to this
miserable king, let us learn to re-cumb on God, for this is the only way to
obtain peace.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For though Zedekiah set before Jeremiah the danger
which he might bring on himself, if he confessed what took place between them,
he yet had a regard no doubt to his own safety, for his care for the Prophet was
not very great. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If,
then</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the princes will hear that I have
spoken to him,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>etc. We see here, that as
kings very curiously inquire into the sayings and actions of all, so they in
their turn are exposed to innumerable spies, who observe all their secret
proceedings. Zedekiah, as we have already seen, left his palace, sought some
secret place, and at the third entrance called to him Jeremiah. This place might
be deemed in some measure secret, yet he knew that he was observed even by his
own servants.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus kings, while they seek immoderate splendor,
renounce the main good, which ought to be preferred to all other things. For it
is commonly said that liberty is an invaluable gift, and it is very true: but
were we to seek for liberty among mankind, we should by no means find it in
courts; for all there are slaves, and slavery begins with the most elevated.
Kings, then, while they thus seek from their height to look down on all mankind,
are placed, as it were, in a theater, and the eyes of all turn to them, so that
no liberty remains for them; and they who hang on their favor are also in
constant fear. This, then, ought to be noticed by us; for there is no one who
does not seek splendor; but yet we know how anxious is the life of princes.
Their external appearance is indeed very flattering; but we do not see what
inward torments harass them. When, therefore, it is said of Zedekiah, that he
could not have a secret conference, it hence appears that kings are by no means
free.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, &#8220;Though they promise thee impunity,
trust them not.&#8221; Zedekiah feared lest the Prophet should be too credulous,
and should freely relate to the counselors what he had said. But he no doubt had
reflected on the fact, that the Prophet had already announced the destruction of
the city. He then could have hardly hoped for the silence which he required.
Hence then it was, that he so earnestly bid him to be careful; and though the
counselors should promise that there would be no danger to him, he yet bade him
to be silent. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Say to
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I humbly prayed the king not to
send me back to the house of Jonathan, that I might not die
there</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It was not indeed a falsehood,
but this evasion cannot be wholly excused. The Prophet justly feared, and, as we
have before seen, he was perplexed and anxious, for that prison was horrible,
and it would have been better at once to die than to have been thus buried alive
in the earth. But it is certain that he did not come to the king for this
purpose, for he had been sent for. Though, then, the Prophet did not expressly
or in so many words say what was false, yet it was a kind of falsehood; and what
follows, in reference to himself, cannot be excused.</font><br></div>

the king had commanded him; but he does not commend what he had done. There is
no doubt but that on the one hand he placed before his eyes the timidity of the
king, who, being forgetful of plain dealing, slavishly feared his own
counselors; and that., on the other hand, he manifested that he was not
sufficiently discreet, for when the princes came, even if he wished not to
deceive them, he yet concealed the main thing, and said that he went to the king
to pray for his own life, which was not true. Though then what he said was in
part true, that he prayed not. to be sent back to prison, yet he could not by
this evasion be wholly exempted from blame.</font><br></div>

the king was silent through fear, and the Prophet also had not made known the

vivid form, the wonderful judgment of God. As long as the Jews boasted that they
offered sacrifices to God, they kept Jeremiah shut up in prison, so that he was
not a free man until the king was taken, the city perished, and almost all were

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah seems here indeed to undertake the office of
an historian rather than that of a Prophet; but he seals his previous
prophecies, and at the same time shews that he had brought forward nothing
rashly or thoughtlessly. There is, then, here a proof of a]l his former
doctrine; he brings before us the reality, and shews that whatever he had
predicted was accomplished by God&#8217;s hand, and in a manner almost
incredible. We now understand what this chapter contains.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">he says that King Nebuchadnezzar <i>came, </i>though
he soon departed from the siege, for, as we shall presently see, he went to
Riblah, which, as some think, was the Antioch of Syria; but of this we shall
speak in its proper place. When, therefore, the king came with his army, he soon
departed, and his purpose was to live at leisure, and in the enjoyment of
pleasures as long as the city was besieged, he was not disposed to undertake the
trouble and weariness of a long warfare; but yet, in order to spread more
terror, he came himself to the City and gave instructions to his
army.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must notice the time: he came
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the ninth year, in the tenth
month</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is about the end of the
year. Zedekiah, no doubt, entertained a good hope, though reports were flying as
to the coming of the Chaldean army; for the king had not so soon prepared for
the war as he ought to have done. he thought that his revolt from the king of
Babylon would be passed by unpunished. But the Prophet here reminds us that it
was a false confidence; for though God spared him for a time and suspended his
judgment, he yet at length punished the impiety of his revolt, to which was also
added ingratitude, as it has been before stated. Thus much as to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the ninth year and the tenth
month</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It then follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the eleventh year, in the
fourth month, the city was broken up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We
hence see that the city was besieged for a year and half; for there was the
whole of the tenth year, and then added must be two months of the ninth year and
four months of the eleventh year; and thus a year and half was the whole time.
Here also we must remember how much the Jews must have suffered; for were a city
at this day to bear a siege for a few months, it would appear a rare instance of
valor; but Jerusalem was besieged for a year and half. Let us now consider what
number of people must have been there, and we have seen that the Prophet
threatened them with famine. And how much scarcity there was in the city, the
Prophet has not only testified elsewhere, but in the book of Lamentations he has
shewed most fully.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;250410&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Lamentations
4:10.) And there was not only famine, but it was followed by pestilence. We
hence learn how ferocious must have been the character of the king, that he
could see miserable men perishing by scores, and yet persist in his obstinacy.
Nor is there a doubt but that the people were also on their part obstinate, and
became at length stupefied through their sufferings; for there was hardly one,
from the least to the greatest, who did not despise what the Prophet taught; and
thus they were all blinded by madness and stupidity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It ought to be noticed that they bore a siege for a
year and six months, and that they were not even then persuaded to surrender
themselves, until the city was broken up, that is, until the walls were beaten
down by battering-rams and other warlike engines; for the city was broken when
the wall, beaten by the engines, fell down. In short, the city was gained by
storm; this is what is meant, and will hereafter be more fully expressed. But I
cannot proceed further now.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">IT is proved here that the prophecy of Jeremiah was
fulfilled; so that it became really evident that he had not spoken unadvisedly,
but from the mouth of God. And thus was fulfilled also what is said as a common
proverb, that fools become wise too late; for they never obey good and wise
counsels while they may, but at length they are made to know by their own
miseries and their teacher, experience, that what they despised is true, but
without any benefit. This happened to Zedekiah, who had been often exhorted by
the Prophet to surrender himself to King Nebuchadnezzar. As, then, he had
obstinately refused the yoke, he was at length constrained to reap the fruit of
his obstinacy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now Jeremiah says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the princes
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of King Nebuchadnezzar, that is, those he had
set over his forces, <i>entered the city, </i>the wall being broken down, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sat in the middle
gate</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for it was necessary for them to
be wary, lest there should be ambushes; and even conquerors do not immediately
penetrate into every part when a city is taken, but search whether all the
places be free from enemies. This then was done by the leaders of the army, for
they stood in </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the middle
gate</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that they might exercise authority
over the city, and yet be safe from all ambushes. Jeremiah mentions some of them
by name, but it is uncertain whether he adds a surname to some of them. But as
this is doubtful and is of no great moment, it is enough for us that the chief
of the leaders are named, in order to accredit the narrative.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">he then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>After Zedekiah saw
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc.; not that he came to that
part, but after he understood that that part of the city was occupied by the
enemies; for matters then had come to an extremity.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then he fled with his men of war.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">And here is set before us a sad spectacle: men
in no way trained up for war were left in the city, women also and children were
left there, while the men of war fled, inasmuch as their condition was worse,
because they had delayed the taking of the city. It was then according to what
is commonly done, that they fled. We yet see that ungodly men, after having long
despised heavenly truth, flee in time of danger, and are so filled with terror,
that they cast themselves headlong into many perils. This is a just reward to
those who are not terrified by the threatenings of God, but become so hardened,
that they too late acknowledge that they ought to have feared; and being, as it
were, stunned, they see not what is expedient, and cannot follow any fixed
course.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet adds, that they fled <i>in the night,
</i>and that they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>went out by the
way of the king&#8217;s garden</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and
lastly, that they came to the <i>gate </i>which was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>between the two
walls</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There is in this passage nothing
superfluous; for he meant to shew us, that though the king thought that he could
escape from the hands of his enemies, he was yet taken, as God had predicted.
For, if after the city was taken, he had come as a suppliant, of his own accord,
he might probably have obtained mercy; and this counsel, we know, was given
while the state of things was not yet desperate; but he put no faith in
God&#8217;s word. In the meantime he thought that he could disappoint his
enemies, if he quickly fled through some secret way. Some think that there was a
subterranean passage, which had a door in the middle of the garden, and had also
an egress at the other end in the plain of Jericho, as we shall hereafter see.
And that region was barren, and therefore solitary. Hence the king entertained
confidence; but he found, at length, how certain was prophetic truth; for it is
said afterwards, that the Chaldeans followed and took him. But this
circumstance, as I have said, ought to be carefully observed, that the king, as
the Prophet tells us, fled. through a secret way, during the darkness of the
night, and escaped. It now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Chaldeans pursued the fugitive king, no doubt,
through a hidden impulse from above. It is, indeed, probable that he was
betrayed by his own people; and this often happens in a disturbed state of
things; but however, he might have escaped, had he not been given up by the hand
of God. These things are therefore narrated, that we may know that the ungodly,
by their evasions, gain no other thing than really to acknowledge that God is
true ill his threatenings as well as in his promises. They believe not his word,
it is therefore necessary that they should be convinced by actual experience.
Zedekiah then is here set before us as an example, so that we may know that as
soon as God announces any calamity, we ought to tremble and to humble ourselves
under his mighty hand, for he holds us on every side completely shut up, so that
if hiding places and refuges be open before us, they can yet avail us
nothing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet then tells us, that he was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>taken in the deserts of
Jericho</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This circumstance also is
important, for he had gone forth beyond the sight of men, even into solitude;
for that plain was not so fruitful as to support many inhabitants, but it was as
it were a desert. It is then a wonder how the Chaldeans found him in that
solitude, but they had God, as it were, as their guide. Hence then it was, that
Zedekiah fell into the hands of the Chaldean army. The Prophet adds, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>brought him into
Riblah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which is thought to have been
Antioch. It is also called Hemath; but this name designated the country and not
the city. And yet in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;300602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Amos
6:2, it means the city, when it is said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Go to Calneh, go
to Hemath the great.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be, that the dignity of the city was the
reason why the country was so called; and no doubt Pliny, in his fifth book,
calls that part of Syria Antiochean; and as to what he says shortly before, that
Antioch was that part of Syria toward Cilicia, that place seems to me to have
been corrupted. I rather read thus, that it was a part of Syria, for, as I have
said, he calls it Antiochean. And it was not unsuitable that the city should be
called Hemath and Riblah, and that the name of the city should be given to the
country. Interpreters indeed agree, that Riblah was Antioch. Jerome says, that
in his day, the first station towards Chaldea still retained its ancient name,
though, by changing some letters, they called it Emmaus. But he doubts not but
it was Antioch, which was formerly called Epidaphne, and had also the name of
Hemath. There then Zedekiah was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>brought to Nebuchadnezzar, who
spoke judgments with him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, who
brought him as a criminal before his tribunal, that he might pronounce sentence
upon him; for to speak judgments means the same as to minister justice or to
pass judgment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this was very inconsistent with royal dignity,
for though, as a conqueror, he was angry with his enemy, he might yet have been
content with his death alone. Kings are not wont to deal in this way with kings,
for they respect themselves, and are not disposed to degrade royal dignity. But
Jeremiah says, that Zedekiah was by no means dealt with royally; for he was
constrained to plead guilty, and was condemned by a solemn sentence. Then to
speak judgments is the same as what we call in French <i>former proces criminel.
</i>And this indignity increased the weight of his calamity and his punishment;
for Zedekiah not only had to bear many reproaches, while the king of Babylon
expostu-lated with him, but he was also brought to judgment, so that punishment,
according to the common practice, was allotted to him. For Nebuchadnezzar had
made him king, and imposed tribute on him. He therefore condemned him as guilty
of perfidy and perjury. This is the degradation which the Prophet points out,
when he says, that he spoke judgments with him, or acted towards him judicially;
and he repeats the same expression in the last chapter. It follows &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">It is probable that Nebuchadnezzar continued in that
pleasant city while Jerusalem was attacked, for he would not endure the
weariness of a long siege, and he also wished to be far away from danger. It was
enough for him that his generals, of whom mention is made, fought under his
banner. Nebuchadnezzar then was beyond the reach of danger, and yet he filled
the Jews with terror, because he did not return home, or to the principal seat
of government, but remained in the neighborhood; for the Antioch of Syria was
not far from Judea.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now tells us how cruelly Nebuchadnezzar
acted towards Zedekiah. It was surely a sad spectacle to see a king, who had
been before in repute, who was of a noble family, who was a type of Christ,
lying prostrate at the feet of a proud conqueror. But much more bitter to him
than this, was to see his own sons killed before his eyes. It would have been
better for him to die a hundred times than to be compelled to witness that
slaughter. He was, however, compelled to do so. And then, that all hope might be
cut off, all those who excelled in dignity and power were slain. For under the
name princes, Jeremiah generally in-eluded the chief men; so that all who had
any name among the people were killed. It was a horrible carnage! not only the
king&#8217;s sons were slain, but all who were capable of restoring the city and
the land to a better condition. Thus Nebuchadnezzar wished to take away every
hope, by putting to death the royal family and all the nobles. It afterwards

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now relates also what happened to others,
even those who remained in the city, and whom Nebuchadnezzar and his army had
spared: he says that they were <i>brought to Babylon. </i>There were those who
had fled and went over to the Chaldeans before the city was taken; for we have
seen that so great was the despair of many, that they revolted, and those were
they whom Zedekiah chiefly feared, lest he should be, as we have seen, an object
of mockery to them, had he gone to the Chaldeans and made a willing surrender.
Jeremiah now says that those also were led into Chaldea. Nebuchadnezzar might
have removed them on this account, because he could not confide in traitors. He
had found out their inconstancy, for they had revolted from their own real and
legitimate king. As then they had. thus once violated their faith, he could not
but regard them with suspicion, and therefore removed them, lest they should
afterwards attempt something new, and create disturbance; or, it may be, that it
was done according to their request, because they feared lest, after the
departure of the Chal-deans, the common people should rage against them, as they
had helped the enemies, and thus had become perfidious and ungrateful towards
their own country. It might then be, that they themselves had made this request,
and that it was granted them: they might then live quietly in a far country, but
they could not be safe in Judea. However, whatever may have been the reason,
Jeremiah tells us, that they were led with the rest into Babylon and
Chaldea.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">he afterwards names the head or general of the army,
even <i>Nebuzaradan, </i>whom he calls the <i>prince </i>of the killers, or of
the cooks. The Greek translators have rendered it
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajrcima&gt;geiron</font><font face="Palatino">,
the prince of the cooks, who at this day is called Grand Master in the courts of
princes. But their opinion is more probable, who render the words, the prince of
the killers. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jbf</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>thebech, </i>means to slay, to kill, and to kill men as well as to slay
beasts; and for this reason some have applied it to cookery. But as Nebuzaradan
is mentioned here as the chief among military men, the probability is that he
was the judge of all capital offenses in the army.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fG9</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence
Jeremiah names him when he says that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>removed who remained in the
city.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But there seems to be here an unnecessary repetition,
as he mentions twice, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the rest of
the people which remained</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There is,
however, a difference, for in the first clause he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the
city</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He then means those who had been
besieged, and whom Nebuchadnezzar had pardoned so as not to put them to death.
The last clause embraces more, even all the inhabitants of the land; for there
were many scattered abroad, on whom Nebuchadnezzar might have vented his rage,
but he removed them as slaves into Chaldea. Then our Prophet speaks here of
these two parties, for he says that there were some remaining in the city, and
that others were remaining, even those who were found scattered through various
parts of the country, and had not been besieged by the Chaldean army. He
afterwards adds, &#8212; </font><br></div>

as it were, the lords of the land when the Chal-deans returned into their own
country. We here see that poverty is often an advantage, for the nobles, as we
have seen, were killed, and many also of the middle class were killed in the
siege of the city, and some of them were treated a little more humanely. Still
the exiles were miserable, and driven to a distant land without any hope of
return. The land was now left to the poor alone; and those who possessed
not&#8217; a foot of ground before, lived now very comfortably; for they were
not so large a number, but that each of them had some extent of land, as we
shall hereafter see. While then these miserable men, who before lived very
scantily, and perhaps begged their bread, while these remained secure in the
land of Judah, the possessors of the land were torn away and driven into exile;
and as Nebuzaradan had assigned to each of them vineyards and fields, it hence
appears how much better it was for them to have suffered hunger for a time, to
have been in an ignoble condition, and to have been trodden as it were under
foot by others, than to have lived in pomp and splendor. Thus often God shews
his <i>care </i>for us, when he suffers us not to rise high, but keeps us in an
obscure and humble condition; and the issue at length proves that he thus had a
regard for our salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the same time there is here set before our eyes a
woeful change. The king is led bound in chains, and is also blind; and all the
rest having left their own, are driven into exile; and, on the other hand, the
poor alone, and needy men who had nothing, dwell at large, as it were, in their
own possessions. As, then, they had their quiet habitations and large fields,
and enjoyed a land so fertile and rich, there is no doubt but that Nebuzaradan
meant thus to rouse the envy of the exiles; for they saw that <i>needy </i>and
worthless men dwelt in that land from which they had been banished. Hence their
indignation was increased when they saw that they were more severely and cruelly
treated than those lowest of men. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now sets forth the paternal care of God,
which he had experienced in the preservation of his life and safety. The
innocent, we know, are often killed in a tumult, and the storming of cities is
turbulent, so that many things are done without any thought; nay, even the
leaders are not able to moderate the excesses of the victorious. When,
therefore, the Chaldeans burnt the palace, Jeremiah might have perished at the
same time, being suffocated by the very smoke of the fire. We know what happened
at the taking of Syracuse. Marcellus did not wish that Archimedes should perish,
nay, he commanded that he should be preserved; for he wished to save that man on
account of his singular industry and noble genius. However, while he was drawing
circles on the ground, he was killed by a common soldier. If no one had come to
Jeremiah, he might, as I have said, have been buried under the ruins of the
palace, when the king&#8217;s court was burnt down. But he says that he had been
wonderfully preserved, for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nebuchadnezzar had given a
command respecting him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that he might
not be exposed to any trouble, but that Nebuzaradan as well as the whole army
should secure his safety.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is indeed probable that the king of Babylon had
heard of Jeremiah; and though he was in prison, yet the Word of God, which he
boldly proclaimed, was not bound. Then the report of this might have reached the
king of Babylon: and hence it was, that he was disposed to preserve him; for he
had given a faithful counsel to Zedekiah. But Nebuchadnezzar no doubt regarded
only his own advantage; and hence we ought to bear in mind the wonderful
goodness of God in preserving, as it were, by his own hand, the life of the
Prophet; so that in extremities no one touched him, but he remained free and
quiet, as we shall hereafter see. But we must put off the rest until

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Jeremiah completes what we began yesterday to
expound, even that by the command of King Nebuchadnezzar he was delivered from
prison. But we have said, that though that heathen king had regard to his own
interest, yet his mind was ruled by the secret power of God, who thus designed
to rescue his servant from death; for God is wont thus to work even by the
ungodly, who have another thing in view. It is not always by a voluntary act
that men serve God, for many execute what God has decreed when they have no
intention of doing so: and he so turns and drives them here and there, that they
are constrained, willing or unwilling, to obey his authority. Thus, then, it was
that Nebuchadnezzar liberated Jeremiah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And yet the Prophet fully believed that he did not
owe his life to King Nebuchadnezzar, but that he had been in a wonderful manner
preserved by God&#8217;s favor; and to shew this is the design of the whole
narrative.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, that the king had sent all-the leaders of
the Chaldean army to take him out of the court of the prison, and that he was
then delivered to the care of Gedaliah, not that he might be watched as usual,
but because the princes knew that the people had entertained hatred towards the
holy Prophet, and therefore wished him to be preserved safe from all violence.
This then was the reason why they committed him to the keeping of Gedaliah, who,
as we shall hereafter see, was in favor with the Chaldeans and highly
esteemed.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet tells us here that God was not unmindful
of that Ethiopian, by whom he had been preserved, though he was an alien and
from a barbarous nation. We have seen, however, that he alone undertook the
cause of the Prophet, when others, being terrified by fear, did not exert
themselves, or were avowedly enemies to God&#8217;s servant. Ebedmelech then
alone dared to go forth in a case so hopeless, and undertook the defense of the
holy man. The Prophet says now that this service was so acceptable, that it
would not be without its reward. We have said that Ebedmelech had thus
manifested his concern for the Prophet&#8217;s life, but not without evident
danger; for he knew that the princes were united against him, and that these
ungodly men had drawn to their side the greatest part of the court and also of
the common people. Then Ebedmelech roused against himself both high and low; but
God aided him, so that he was not overpowered by his adversaries. In his very
danger he experienced the favor of God, and was protected and delivered from
danger.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But now he finds that he had not ill employed his
exertions; for he had not only been humane and merciful towards a mortal man,
but had also done service for God; for whatever we do for God&#8217;s servants,
he acknowledges as done to himself, and will have it to be laid to his account,
according to what Christ says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;He who gives a cup
of cold water to one of the least of my disciples, shall not lose his
reward.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401042&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
10:42)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is then no doubt but that the Spirit of God
intended by the example of Ebedmelech to rouse us to the duties of humanity,
even to teach us to sue-coup the miserable, and to give them help as far as we
can, and not to shun the hatred of men or any dangers, which we may thereby
incur. And as we are torpid and negligent in doing good, the reward given to the
Ethiopian is set before us, so that we may know, that though nothing is to be
hoped from men, when we are kind and liberal, yet we shall not lose our labor,
for God is rich enough, who can render to us more than can be expected from the
whole world. This then is the lesson conveyed here.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the <i>circumstances </i>must be noticed: the
Prophet says, that he was <i>commanded </i>to promise deliverance to
Ebedme-lech, while he was yet confined in prison. This, at the first view, seems
strange; for the Prophet might have objected and said, &#8220;Thou biddest me to
go forth; why, then, are not the gates of the prison opened for me? and then
thou wouldst have me to be the herald of thy favor; but my present miserable
condition will prevent any credit to be given to my words: for how can
Ebedmelech believe that I have been sent. by thee? for I am here confined and
surrounded by many deaths.&#8221; But let us hence learn not to bring down
God&#8217;s word to our judgment, when anything is promised beyond our
expectation, and all our conceptions. Though, indeed, God seemed, as it were, to
mock his servant, when he ordered him, a prisoner, to go to Ebedmelech; and yet
the Prophet received and embraced this command, and performed it, no doubt,
though this is not expressly mentioned.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is the reason why he says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a word came to him from Jehovah,
while he was in the court of the
prison</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word <i>Ethiopian </i>is now repeated, because
God intended, in the person of an alien indirectly to reprove the Jews; for no
doubt they despised him, because he was not of the holy seed of Abraham. But God
shews that he peculiarly regarded him, while he rejected the masked and
hypocritical children of Abraham, who were only born of him according to the
flesh, but had, by their impiety, renounced him, so that they were wholly
unworthy of so high an honor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go and say, Behold, I am bringing
my words on this city for evil and not for good; and they shall be before thee
in that day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We conclude, from these
words, that this was spoken to Ebedmelech before the city was taken by the
Chaldeans, in order that he might remain quietly at home, and not flee away with
the king, who, as we have seen, tried to escape. God then intended to strengthen
the confidence of Ebedmelech, so that he might not fear and tremble like others,
and expose himself to death, in trying to secure his safety. For this is the
design of all God&#8217;s promises, even to keep us from being disturbed, to
give us quietness of mind, and to cause us to look for the help promised to us.
For we know that when fear lays hold on our minds, there is no settled purpose,
but we are harassed by disquietude, and, as it were, tossed to and fro. It was
therefore God&#8217;s design to bring aid beforehand, so that Ebedmelech might
not, with others, be hurried into despair. He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I am
bringing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. God here confirms
Ebedmelech in the truth, that he would be the author of the calamity; for had
Jerusalem been taken by chance, Ebedmelech might justly have feared; but when he
was taught that it was to happen through God&#8217;s just judgment he would feel
sure of his safety; for it would be in the power of the same God to save one man
and even many, while he was destroying the whole people. This, then, is the
reason why God declared that he was <i>bringing </i>his words for evil and not
for good; for except Ebedmelech had been convinced that the city and its
inhabitants were in God&#8217;s hand and power, he could never have been led to
entertain good hope; but when he knew that the city would perish through the
righteous vengeance of God, he would then be fully confident as to his own
safety; for God promised to preserve him in the midst of the common
ruin.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, Thou shalt see,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>my words shall be before
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as though he had said, &#8220;Thou
shalt be an eye-witness of my power.&#8221; It was indeed necessary, as I have
said, that Ebedmelech should see God&#8217;s hand in the destruction of the city
and people; for he would ever have vacillated, and would have known no rest, had
he not before his eyes the hand and the vengeance of God, This is one thing. But
as to the words, <i>I</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> am
bringing my words for evil and not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for
good, we have explained them elsewhere. The word evil does not mean sin here,
but according to a common usage, evil is said to be whatever men regard as
adverse to them; so all punishments inflicted by God are called evils, as we
find in Isaiah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I am God, who
create light and darkness, life and
death,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">good and evil.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234507&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
45:7)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But I will deliver thee in that
day, and thou shalt not be given up into the hand of the men whose face thou
fearest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here God promises that
Ebedmelech would be saved through a special privilege; and the Prophet shews
that this prophecy had not been without reason announced. For though Ebedmelech
had, with an intrepid mind, undertaken the cause of Jeremiah, and boldly and
perseveringly fronted all reproaches, he yet was not divested of all the
feelings of nature, but he had his fears, especially when he saw the cause of
fear set before him. Hence the Prophet says, that he <i>feared </i>the face of
enemies: and this might, at the same time, avail to rouse him to receive with
more alacrity, the promise offered to him; for we know that the blessings of God
are, in a manner, deemed of no value by us, when we do not know how necessary to
us they are. The prophecies and the promises, by which God comforts us and
animates us to patience, are for the most part viewed as of no worth, until God
really shews to us how miserable we must be, except he thus succors us. Then the
Prophet wished to remind Ebedmelech of this, when he said that he <i>feared.
Thou fearest, </i>he says. For if Ebedmelech had no fear, he might have
disregarded this prophecy as being superfluous. But being reminded of his fear
and anxiety, he became more ready to receive what God promised to
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he says, that he would be safe, because the Lord
would </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>deliver him in that
day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And, again, he confirms the same
thing, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For delivering I will
deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the
sword</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Prophet again calls the
attention of Ebedmelech to God himself; for we know how all things are in a
confusion when cities are taken by storm. Except then Ebedmelech had his mind
fixed on God, he could never have retained any hope of deliverance. Hence the
Prophet assures him again, that God would be his deliverer. And he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy soul shall be for a
prey</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This mode of expression has been
elsewhere explained. The comparison is taken from those who deem that a great
gain which is yet but small, if they get it beyond their expectation, as when a
man finds a prey which he had by no means hoped for: he becomes suddenly rich,
or increased in his goods; and though the gain may not be great, he yet greatly
rejoices. So they who escape alive from present death, have no small reason to
be joyful, because their life has been preserved. In the meantime God alludes to
those who regard it enough to escape from death, though they may be deprived of
all other things. As those who, in shipwreck, cast forth their mer-chandize, and
their money, and all they have, deem it enough if they can reach the harbor, and
they prefer to beg their bread all their life rather than to sink in the midst
of the sea, so he who escapes with his life; though poverty is bitter, yet the
horror of death is so great, that he deems his life a great, gain, though
stripped of all that he had.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The reason follows, <i>because </i>he <i>trusted
</i>in God. Another reason might have been assigned, even because he had not
been wanting in his kindness to a holy man, but had extended his hand to him in
his extreme misery; but as that office of humanity proceeded from faith and
piety, God does here express the chief cause. As then the mercy which Ebedmelech
exercised towards the Prophet was an evidence of his piety and faith, here is
found the fruit in its own tree, or in its root: and certain it is, that
Ebedmelech would have never been so humane towards the Prophet, had he not
relied on God and his aid; for unbelief is always timid. There is then no doubt
but that the vigor which appeared in Ebedmelech, when he regarded his life in
bringing aid to the Prophet, made manifest that faith which is now commended:
<i>because </i>then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou hast
trusted in me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>therefore
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>delivering I will deliver
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says God. There is now then no
doubt but that Ebedmelech had some of the elements of faith and piety. If then
God has allowed us to make farther progress, we may feel the more assured that
he will be our deliverer; for his grace and his power will ever exceed our
faith, how much so ever it may be. Now follows &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here Jeremiah pursues more at large what he had
briefly touched upon before; for the Hebrews were wont, in a few words, to state
the substance of the whole, and then to explain more diffusely what, they had
briefly said. Jeremiah had before told us that some of the Babylonian generals
had been sent to release him from prison; and he added that he had been
committed to the care of Gedaliah, who had been set over the poor of the land.
He now tells us, that he, as yet bound with chains, had been brought forth to
Ramah in that miserable condition. These things appear inconsistent, but, as I
have said, we must bear in mind, that there is an omission in that summary,
which we have noticed. For, in the first instance, Jeremiah only said, that he
had been freed from his chains; but he now states the manner more distinctly,
and, as it were, the different parts of the transaction. Then this order ought
to be especially noticed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, this chapter so begins, that he seems
throughout the chapter to have forgotten the introduction. He says, that a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>word
came</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to him; he afterwards declares
historically, how he had been brought to Ramah, and then that he had been
released there, and also that Gedaliah was set over the remainder of the people:
in short, there is not in this long&#8217; passage any mention made of any
prophecy; but there is inserted a whole historical narrative before the Prophet
expresses what God had committed to him, after the city was taken, and after he
had been restored to his former liberty. When, therefore, he says here, that a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>word
came</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to him, we must wait until he has
completed what we find in this chapter; for he will then return to this
prophecy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now consider the words.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>After
Nebuzaradan</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dismissed him from
Ramah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc.; into which place he had
been brought by the guards, when he was as yet bound with chains. There is then
no doubt but that the leaders of the army had ordered Jeremiah to be brought
there, after he was taken out of the court of the prison, and that he was
brought there in the presence of all the people; for it is probable also that
all the Jews, who were to be led into exile, were brought there too, and that
they were there mustered, that none might escape, for they would have slipped
off here and there, had they not been delivered to guards. When, therefore, all
the captives were there, Nebuzaradan ordered Jeremiah to be brought forth, not
for the sake of degrading him, for, as we have seen, the king had been
solicitous about his life; and no doubt this coutier wished to gratify his king
in every way: but it was, on the contrary, for the purpose of an indirect
reproof to all the people, as though he would honor the servant of God, who had
so faithfully warned them, and for so long a time, even above forty years, and
would set before them their wickedness, and also their ingratitude, for having
so cruelly treated God&#8217;s servant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This then was the reason why Nebuzaradan wished
Jeremiah to come bound with chains, and to be released in the presence of all
the people; it was that the Jews might at length be ashamed of their pride and
impiety against God, and of their ingratitude towards the holy Prophet.
Nebu-zaradan then did not treat Jeremiah reproachfully; but he brought him forth
in chains, that he might publicly expose the wickedness of the whole
nation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, that an <i>option </i>was given him by
Nebuzaradan; so that if he wished, he might remain in his own country, and
choose the best place for himself, and the situation which was most agreeable to
him; but if he chose rather to go to Babylon, there he might go. This,
certainly, was a liberal offer. The Prophet was not only freed from prison and
loosed from His chains; but liberty was so given him, that he alone was free,
while the whole nation was reduced to bondage. For they who remained had no
liberty to go elsewhere. But Nebuzaradan gave here a free option to Jere-mime,
so that he was at liberty either to live in Chaldea, or to remain in any place
he wished, or in any part of the earth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But before he says this, he administers reproof to
the people, and says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah thy
God hath spoken evil on this city</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and he hath brought
it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, and made it to come. </i>Here
Nebuzar-adan undertook the prophetic <i>office, </i>and spoke in high terms of
God&#8217;s righteous vengeance on the people. There is no doubt but that God
had raised up such a teacher to the Jews; for they had for forty years and more
obstinately rejected celestial truth. God had not ceased kindly to invite them
to repentance, and to promise them pardon and salvation, provided they repented.
As then God had not ceased for so long a time, and continually to address them
according to his paternal goodness, and at the same time had spoken to the deaf,
they deserved to hear such a preacher as Nebuzaradan, who now contumeliously
upbraided them, that they had brought this evil on themselves, because they had
been disobedient and rebellious against God, as they had not obeyed his
word.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is here a remarkable example set before us, so
that we may learn, that when God addresses us by his servants, we ought
immediately to render obedience to him; let us learn to fear when he threatens
us, and learn to entertain hope when he offers his favor to us. For if we reject
the Prophets when they are sent to us, other teachers will arise, who will
deride us, and though they may be themselves ungodly, they will yet upbraid us
with our impiety. This then is the doctrine we ought to gather from this
passage, in which we see that Nebuzaradan, as though gifted with the prophetic
spirit, severely rebuked the people. He, indeed, addressed Jeremiah, and seems
to have included him with the people, when he said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy God hath spoken &#8212;
because ye have sinned </i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>and have been
rebellious. </i>But Nebuzaradan, no doubt, thus highly commended the
faithfulness of Jeremiah, because he had been true and faithful in his vocation
and office, he then did not make him as one of the people, nor did he mean that
he had sinned with others, or had been rebellious against God. But, in the
first, place, he addressed Jeremiah,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he said; and this was expressed by
way of honor, even that God was the God of Jeremiah; for though the people
boasted that they were holy, yet Nebuzaradan here indirectly condemned their
foolish boastings, since he inti-mated that Jeremiah alone was worthy of being
deemed one of God&#8217;s servants, as though he had said, that the Jews were
unworthy of the honor of glorying in God&#8217;s name, or of professing it:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy God
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND FIFTY-THIRD</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WE began yesterday to explain the words of
Nebuzaradan which he spoke before all the Jews. We have said that though he
directed his words to Jeremiah, yet what he said referred to the whole people;
for he spoke in praise of Jeremiah, and subscribed to his prophecies: he hence
concluded that the people deserved their extreme punishment. he says that God
<i>had spoken, </i>not that he had faith in the words of Jeremiah, but as far as
he saw, that they were serviceable to his purpose. He-gladly laid hold on what
he approved, as ungodly men do, who embrace what is useful for them in
God&#8217;s Law and the Prophets, though they do not regard them with much
reverence; and yet they pretend a great concern for religion. Such was the case
with Nebu-zaradan; when he had got the victory over the Jews, he boasted that he
was the minister of God;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>has
spoken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as though he had said, that the
Jews suffered such punishment as they deserved, because God had long before
declared that he would punish them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And then he adds, that God had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>done</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>as he had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spoken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>because they had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sinned</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hearkened
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>voice</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>He was nothing better; but as I have already said, he boldly reproved
others. And this is a common thing with hypocrites and all despisers of God;
they are judges in another&#8217;s cause, but look not, as one has said, on the
other side of the wallet. Thus all are keen and ready enough to condemn others;
and of this we have an example here in Nebuzaradan, for, as though he was the
lawful judge of the people, he declared that the destruction of the city and
Temple had not happened by chance, but that it was a just punishment inflicted
by God on the wicked, because they had obstinately rejected the prophetic
doctrine, and had been intractable and disobedient.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nor is there indeed a doubt, as we hinted yesterday,
but that God, in order to expose the Jews to greater shame, raised up for them
this prophet; for when Jeremiah addressed them, and that for their safety, while
yet there was time to repent, they had perversely rejected that favor of God.
They then deserved to be addressed with no benefit by a foreign teacher, who
exulted over them, as this unbelieving heathen did in the present
instance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the option given to Jeremiah, we said yesterday
that it was openly made in the presence of the Jews, in order that Nebuzaradan
might wound them the more. But at the same time it was God&#8217;s purpose to
make the perseverance of his servant an example, as we shall hereafter see. Let
us now proceed, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah goes on with the same discourse, that
Nebuzar-adan dealt bountifully with him, and permitted him to go wherever he
wished. We hence conclude that Nebuchadnezzar was fully convinced of the honesty
and uprightness of Jeremiah. For he knew how he was regarded among his own
people, and that he might rouse great disturbances, except he was upright and
quiet. As, then, Nebuchadnezzar had no doubt respecting&#8217; the character of
Jeremiah, he wished to grant him free liberty to choose his own habitation in
any city he pleased, or to remove wherever it seemed good to him. Invitation was
given him to go to Babylon, and a promise of favor was added; but it was further
permitted to him to remain in his own country.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I have said that this was done according to the
divine purpose, that the Prophet might give a proof of his religion. For if he
had gone to Chaldea, it might have been that the confidence of many would have
failed them, and that faith in the promises would have vanished: for they might
have thought it a sign of hopeless despair, had the Prophet gone there. That he
might not then disturb weak minds, he thought it his duty to remain in his own
country. And hence God inclined the mind of Nebuchadnezzar and the minds of his
leaders to grant liberty to the holy Prophet to remain in Judea, as though for
the purpose of raising a standard for the captives, and of accomplishing their
return after seventy years. We shall, however, see presently that he was led
away elsewhere; but that in no degree frustrated his prophecies, because violent
men led him away as a captive, and he at length died in Egypt. But he did not
willingly remove from Judea, though he found there nothing but grief and sorrow;
for he did not gratify himself, nor could he indulge in any pleasures, in the
abundance of meat and drink, but he was ever lamenting the overthrow of his own
nation, and especially the destruction of the Temple. As, then, he preferred
Judea to all other countries, and submitted to be a constant spectator of so
many miseries, he gave a remarkable proof of his faith and patience, and thus
strengthened the faith of the miserable exiles, so that they might know that God
would be yet merciful and propitious to his people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He goes on with the words of Nebuzaradan, but he
introduces this clause, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He was
not yet gone back</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, because he
was not yet gone back. Then Nebuzaradan said,
<i>&#8220;</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Return to
Gedaliah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, if thou preferrest to
live here rather than to follow me, then go to Gedaliah.&#8221; Here Nebuzaradan
shews how he would have Jeremiah to live in safety in that land, which was as
yet like a den of robbers, even that he should be with Gedaliab. And we see how
solicitous Nebuzaradan was to preserve the life of the Prophet, for he wished
that Gedaliah should be his guardian, as he had briefly said before; but he now
sets the matter more fully and more at large before him,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Return</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to Gedaliah, whom

him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>he intimates that Jeremiah would be
without danger if he dwelt with Gedaliah, because he had been set over Judah by
the king of Babylon. Repeated at the same time is what we have before observed,
that it was in the Prophet&#8217;s power, either to go to Gedaliah or to go
anywhere else; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whatever
place</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it seems right in thine eyes to
go to, go there</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He did not then assign
to him any certain place, but gave him leave to go anywhere; so that the Prophet
was to choose for himself an habitation either in Judea or out of
Judea.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It follows, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gave him

areche, </i>though some, <i>&#8220;a </i>present;&#8221; but it means food, as
we shall hereafter see in the fifty-first chapter, where Jeremiah speaks of
daily bread. The second word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ha&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>meshae, </i>I regard as meaning a gift or a present. Then Nebuzaradan
bestowed on God&#8217;s servant food and other gifts. As to food, the Prophet
might have well <i>accepted </i>it, for after the city was taken we know that he
must have been in want of <i>everything. </i>Even before, he lived very scantily
and miserably, having only a piece of bread daily. And now, when Nebuzaradan
supplied him with food, there was no reason why the holy man should not in such
want receive what was given him. But as to the <i>presents, </i>Jeremiah may
seem to have forgotten himself; for it was a disgrace to him to receive from an
enemy of God&#8217;s people, a present or gifts for his doctrine; for whence
proceeded this benevolence and bounty to the Prophet, except that Nebuzaradan
knew that his prophecy referred to the destruction of his own nation? It seems,
then, that for this reason he wished to reward the holy man; he ought then to
have refused these presents. But it is probable that he was not enriched by a
large sum of money, or by costly things; Nebuzaradan only gave him some token of
benevolence; and the Prophet might without suspicion have received the present,
not as a reward for his doctrine, but rather as a confirmation of it offered by
God, because the Jews had been enemies to him as long as he had been faithfully
spending his labors among them; for when he bitterly reproved them, he had no
other object but to secure their safety. But as he had been so inhumanely
treated by the Jews, God intended that more humanity should be shown to him by a
heathen and barbarous nation than by the children of Abraham, who boasted that
they were the holy people of God. It was, then, for this reason that Jeremiah
received gifts from the hand of Nebuzaradan. It follows, &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">Here is shown to us the firmness of the Prophet, that
he hesitated not to reject, what Nebuzaradan kindly offered to him, and yet he
might have committed a great offense in making light, as it were, of Chaldea. It
was, as we know, a very pleasant country, and very fertile; and tyrants cannot
bear their bounty to be despised; for when they are pleased to honor any one,
however little may be what they offer, if he refuses, they regard it as a
dishonor done to them. The Prophet, then, might have been overcome by modesty
and fear, so as to remove to Chaldea. That he dared simply to refuse the offer,
and to ask that he might dwell in his own country, was a proof and evidence that
he had more concern for religion, and more care for God&#8217;s Church, than for
all the favors of men, and all that he might have hoped from the wealth of
Babylon and Chaldea.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see that the Prophet in receiving presents,
accepted of nothing but what he knew would be for the benefit of God&#8217;s
Church. At the same time he made light of the offense he might have given, when
he chose to remain in his own country; for as we have said, it was as though he
erected a standard to invite the Jews to return, and thus to prove the truth of
his prophecy respecting their exile being temporary, the end of which was to be
hoped for after seventy years. For this reason he says, that he went to
Gedaliah, and dwelt in the midst of the people, even Of those who remained in

were forced to flee from the cities at the first entrance of the Chaldean army.

were overtaken and caught in the plain of Jericho, as we have already seen. I
then think that they were those who had been scattered here and there, having
deserted the cities committed to them at the first approach of their enemies. As
then they had been wanderers from their own country and exiles, they now
returned to Gedaliah. By saying that the

<div><font face="Palatino">Here, as I have hinted, is explained the great
humanity of Gedaliah, and also his pious solicitude for his own nation, in order
that the perfidy and cruelty of the son of Nethaniah might appear the more
detestable, who slew a man so well deserving in his conduct to him and to
others, having been led to do so by reward.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet says that he <i>swore </i>to them; nor
was it strange to interpose an oath in a state of things so disturbed. Hardly
could Ishmael and the rest have any confidence, since the Chaldeans had been so
extremely hostile to them; they must, indeed, have been in the greatest
trepidation. There was, therefore, need of a remedy, even that Gedaliah should
assure them of his integrity. This was the reason why he made an oath; for had
it been in times of tranquillity, an oath would not have been necessary. But as
their life hung, as it were, on a thread, and they saw many dangers on every
side, there was need of a confirmation; nor did Gedaliah receive them without
some danger; for it was not pleasing to the Chaldeans that such men should
continue in the land. For we have seen that the princes had been on this account
killed, and then all the chief men among the people had been removed to Chaldea,
lest any of them should attempt some new commotions. It was, therefore, the
object of Nebuchadnezzar to keep the country quiet; and this was the best way to
prevent any disturbance. Gedaliah then, no doubt, saw that this would not be
very agreeable to the Chaldeans, and yet his humanity prevailed, and his concern
for his own nation, that he not only hospitably received them, but also promised
them by an oath, that there would be safety for them. He therefore exhorted them
to be confident, and also to serve the Chaldeans. It was, indeed, especially
expected of them, that they should surrender up themselves, as their case was
hopeless. Then Gedaliah promised that the Chaldeans would be content with a
voluntary submission; and he promised them also, that there would be a safe
dwelling for them in the land.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he ordered them to <i>gather </i>wine, and corn,
and fruit, and to store them up, as there would be no danger from war. He also
ordered them to dwell in the <i>cities </i>which they had taken, or to which
they had been driven. The verb here is ambiguous; but I prefer its most literal
meaning, <i>which ye have taken. </i>They could not, indeed, have taken a city
by force and arms, as they had only a few men, and could never have been equal
to their enemies. Then the forcible taking of cities is not what is meant; but
Gedaliah&#8217;s meaning was, that they might safely remain wherever they were,
or that they might dwell in any city they came to. But it was a great
&#8216;thing when he said to them, that he would <i>stand </i>for them; for he
thus laid down his own life, as though he had said that he would be a surety
that nothing grievous should happen to them. And hence it is more clearly seen
that he did not regard himself, but that he used the power given him for the
public good; for if he had ambition, he would have been, doubtless, more careful
to ingratiate himself with the king of Babylon, and he would have resolved to
deal no less cruelly with a people so hard and refractory, than their enemies.
But when he extended his wings as the hen, to gather under them the residue of
his own nation, it appears quite evident that he had no care for his own private
safety, but that whatever power had been given him by King Nebuchadnezzar, he
employed it wholly for the public good.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then these words ought to be especially noticed, And
<i>I, </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>behold, I will dwell in
Mizpah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, that I may stand, </i>etc., that is,
that I may meet the Chaldeans <i>who may come to us, </i>that is, lest they
should come upon you for some hostile purpose. It afterwards follows

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet shews here, that except intestine
wickedness had arisen, the condition of the people would have been endurable
until the time of exile had elapsed. God had pre-fixed, as it has been before
stated, seventy years. Nebuchadnezzar had already so withdrawn the flower of the
people, that still some inhabitants remained, that the land might not be wholly
naked and forsaken. For besides the poor who had been left, he has already told
us, that some chief men came with their troops. He now adds that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all the
Jews</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>who had fled to neighboring
nations, came to Geda-liah; some had taken refuge among the Ammonites, and some
among the Moabites; these came and <i>dwelt </i>in the land. Then God did thus
moderate the rigor of his vengeance, so that some remnants continued in Judea
until the restoration of the whole people. But the perverseness of those who had
before despised his favor, is on the other hand most clearly shewn. God no doubt
designed to make manifest their extreme wickedness; for they not only despised
the kindness of King Nebuchadnezzar, but rushed headlong to their own ruin; for
their fury and madness led them on to kill their own leader, and thus all things
were thrown into confusion, as this might have provoked the indignation of the
conqueror to obliterate the very name of the people by slaying the captives as
well as those who had been left in the land. To point out this was the object of
the Prophet in this part of the chapter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all the
Jews</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>he puts in the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;g</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>gam, </i>for the sake of emphasis,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and even all the
Jews</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>who had fled either to the
Moabites or to the children of Ammon, or to the Idumeans, or to other parts in
other countries. There is no doubt but they made up a considerable number. Then
the whole land must have had many inhabitants; and though it was not populous,
yet the desolation that might have been feared, was not extreme. We hence
conclude, that there was no over-statement made, when Gedaliah promised security
to the leaders of the forces and their companions. As he then made an oath that
they would all be safe, he did not deceive them, for he really proved his
faithfulness, because these miserable exiles, who returned into Judea, dwelt in
safety, and God also gave them a rich abundance of fruits, so that they lived
comfortably in their own country. Before the city was taken these were
wanderers, and no doubt they must have suffered great poverty and want. But now
the Lord gave them relief, and supplied them with plenty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we hence know more fully how great must have been
the impiety and wickedness of Ishmael and his companions, who not only had the
liberty to dwell comfortably in their own country under the care and protection
of Gedaliah, but who also enjoyed abundance of blessings. For as the most
miserable of them gathered great abundance of fruits, they might have had a
large portion of all good things. Hence then the more and the more detestable
appeared their ingratitude. And it further appears how extreme and incurable was
their perverseness, that they were not moved and affected, when they saw
Jerusalem destroyed, the temple burnt, and the horrible slaughter which had
taken place; and especially when they knew what Nebuzaradan had preached
respecting God&#8217;s vengeance, and had performed the office of a prophet in
reproving them. That they thus so obstinately rejected the blessings of God and
resisted what he did for them, was an evident proof that they were monstrously
stupid; and this is what the Prophet intended to shew, as we shall hereafter
see. But I must make an end here.</font><br></div>

destruction of the city and the burning of the Temple. It was some token of
mercy, when Gedaliah was set over the remnant of the people and the poor, who
had been allowed to dwell in the land. But now Gedaliah is slain, and a
miserable scattering must have ensued. The wrath also of the king of Babylon was
kindled, because the Chaldeans, who had been given as guards, were at the same
time killed. It was then God&#8217;s purpose to execute his judgment also on
these remnants.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet shews how it was that Gedaliah was
killed, even because Ishmael had been hired and advised by the king of Ammon. he
says, however, that he had been warned by the sons of Kareah, of whom mention
has been made, but that he had no faith in them. And hence the Prophet begins by
saying, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>John the son of
Kareah </i></font><font face="Palatino">and the other leaders
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>came
</i></font><font face="Palatino">to him. He had, as we have seen, received them
before, and had sworn to them that he would be their defender, so that no one
would hurt them; he had undertaken to face all danger, and offered his head as a
pledge that the Chaldeans would not attempt anything against them. They
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>came
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then to him, because with safety was connected
public benefit, he had, then, bound them to himself by no common benefit, and it
was for their good that he should be safe and secure, who was in favor with the
king of Babylon. They therefore came and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>said, that Ishmael the son of
Nethaniah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>was suborned by the king of
Ammon<i>. </i>It may have been that the king of Ammon had hoped to be the king
of Judea, or to have all that land as his own after the departure of the
Chaldean army. But as his expectation was disappointed, he began to attempt
another tiling, to render the land desolate by creating disturbances. Such then
seems to have been the reason why he induced Ishmael to undertake the impious
and abominable act of killing Gedaliah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to Gedaliah having no faith in their words, a
question may be here raised, How was it that God suffered this holy man, endued
with such rare virtues, to be basely killed by a traitor and an assassin? In the
first place, we must hold it as true, that God&#8217;s judgments are just,
though they correspond not with our notions. It seems indeed, at the first
glance, very unaccountable, that Gedaliah should have been slain, who <i>yet
</i>had emerged, as it were, from death, and had obtained favor with the
Chaldeans; but it was God&#8217;s pur<i>pose </i>to take him to himself, and at
the same time to execute his vengeance to the utmost on the people; for we shall
see that those who had been left were wholly unworthy of God&#8217;s favor; and
we shall also see, that as mad wild beasts they ran headlong to death, and never
ceased to provoke God&#8217;s wrath against them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us then learn from this passage, that when God
calls his servants from this world, he regards their salvation, so that death is
for their good. For Gedaliah might have seen, that had he lived longer, things
more bitter than hundred deaths would have happened to him. It was then
God&#8217;s will to take him in time, before he was overwhelmed with sorrows.
For it was no small cause of grief to see the people obstinately struggling
against the goodness of God, until their final ruin came. This obstinacy then
might have been the cause of incredible sorrow to the holy man: hence the Lord
removed him in due time. In the meantime, as I have said, he opened a way for
his wrath, so that after it became evident that the remnant that had been saved
were wholly unworthy of mercy, they were destroyed together with the
rest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But, in the second place, we see that there was a
fault mixed with virtue in Gedaliah. Love, indeed, is not suspicious, as Paul
says, and ought not easily to admit an accusation.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 13:5.) But he ought to have been <i>circumspect, </i>not only for
his own sake, but because his death brought with it the ruin of the whole
people. He ought then to have been more cautious. But we hence learn how
difficult it is even for the best of men, endued with peculiar virtues, so to
conduct themselves, as not to deviate on either side. It was a. praiseworthy
simplicity that Gedaliah did not suspect that Ishmael would be so perfidious and
so wicked; but as in this instance he shewed no regard for himself nor for the
public safety, he was to be blamed. But, as I have said, it was God&#8217;s
purpose to remove him to his rest, for had he lived, he would have been a
hundred times overwhelmed with troubles. Ungodly men may blast the memory of the
holy man, because he had been so stupid: but as I have already said, that as he
must have deviated either on this or that side, it was better that Ishmael
should not be accused until he was found guilty. Gedaliah&#8217;s only mistake
was, that he disregarded the treachery of which he had been warned. It now
follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">We here see that the holy man was blinded, so that he
not only disregarded the counsel given to him, but also rejected the help
offered to him. It is again a thing worthy of praise, that he was unwilling that
Ishmael should be rashly killed, the cause being not known; but he ought to have
carefully inquired, and the thing being found out, he might have defended
himself, and put to death a wicked man and a public pest. He was armed with the
sword; and he might have justly punished Ishmael, if he had only been attentive
to the matter, that is, if he had taken the trouble to ascertain the fact. As
then he had been endued with authority, for Nebuchadnezzar had set him over the
land, he was to be blamed in this, that he abstained from taking&#8217;
vengeance, (for he was not a private man,)but he did not believe that there was
so great a treachery in Ishmael, whom he thought to be an honest and upright
man, and friendly to him. Nevertheless, there is a medium between simplicity on
the one hand, and cruelty on the other. Had he immediately become incensed
against Ishmael, it would have been blamable cruelty; for we ought not to be
carried away headlong to condemn innocent men; for if we indiscriminately
receive all sorts of calumnies, no man can remain innocent. But as I have said,
Gedaliah might have so acted as not to wrong Ishmael by believing every idle
report, and yet he might have taken care of himself. He might have done this,
had he inquired, and having known the case, determined accordingly; but he
willfully closed his eyes, and thus committed a great mistake.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we hence see, that when in other things he was
not without judgment and foresight, he was in this instance, as it were,
destitute of a sound mind; for it was God&#8217;s purpose to open a way for his
judgment, so that he might destroy the remnant of the people. And at the same
time we see how difficult it is not to do wrong, when we desire to be just,
tolerant, and unsuspicious. We are, in short, taught, how difficult a thing it
is, and how rare is the virtue to exercise moderation. Ishmael might have been
immediately convicted of perfidy and wickedness; this was what Gedaliah was
unwilling to do; and why? because he was unwilling to suspect anything wrong in
a man whom he thought to be sincere and faithful. Well, but at the same time he
did wrong to John, the son of Kareah, and to the other leaders of the forces.
They came to him, not one man or two men, but the chiefs who had been set over
the soldiers by King Zedekiah. These came to him, so that their charge was
probable. What did Gedaliah say?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou speakest
falsely</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he said. he reproachfully
repelled John, the son of Kareah, who yet was well disposed towards him, and
wished to save him from his danger. We hence clearly see that the best of men
never so act, but that under the color of equity and humanity they often fall
into sloth and neglect; and that when they wish to be humane towards one, they
act unkindly and reproachfully towards many. So it is ever necessary to flee to
God, that he may rule us by the spirit of discretion. Now follows the murder of
Gedaliah.</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was a detestable cruelty and barbarity in Ishmael
to kill Gedaliah who entertained him, and whom he found to possess a paternal
regard towards him. Heathens have ever deemed hospitality sacred; and to violate
it has been counted by them as the greatest atrocity; and hospitable Jupiter
ever possessed among them the right of taking vengeance, if any one broke an
oath given when at table. Now Ishmael had sworn, as we have seen, that he would
be faithful to Gedaliah. He was again received by him, and was treated
hospitably; and from his table he rose up to slay the innocent man, who was his
friend, and had acted towards him, as it has been stated, the part of a father.
And hence he became not only a parricide, but also the traitor of his own
country; for he knew that it could not be but that Nebuchadnezzar would become
more and more incensed against that miserable people, whom he had spared: but he
made no account of his own fidelity, nor shewed any regard for his own brethren,
whom he knew he exposed to slaughter and ruin.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the cause of this madness is here indirectly
intimated; the Prophet says, that he was of the <i>royal seed. </i>The royal
seed was then, indeed, in the greatest disgrace; the king&#8217;s children had
been slain; he himself had been taken away bound to Babylon after Nebuchadnezzar
had made him blind. But we see, that those who had been once in any dignity, can
hardly relinquish those high notions by which they are inflated. So that when
those of the royal seed are reduced to extreme poverty and want, they still aim
at something royal, and never submit to the power of God. The fountain then of
this madness the Prophet points out here, as by the finger, when he says, that
Ishmael was </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the royal
seed</i></font><font face="Palatino">: for he thought that it was by no means an
honor to him, that Gedaliah was set over the Jews. He, no doubt, imagined that
the kingdom was to be perpetual, since God had so often promised, that the
throne of David would stand as long as the moon continued in the heavens.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;198908&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
89:87) But mere ambition and pride led him to commit this abominable murder: and
thus it was, that he suffered himself to be persuaded by the king of
Ammon.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then <i>came </i>together with the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>princes of the
king</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>even those who were in the first
rank when Zedekiah reigned. Then the Prophet adds, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>did eat
bread</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This phrase intimates that they
were received hospitably, and were admitted to the table of Gedaliah. And this
kindness and benevolence ought to have induced Ishmael and his associates to
spare their host. But it follows, that they <i>rose up. </i>This circumstance,
as to the time, enhanced their crime; for it was at the time they were eating
that Ishmael slew Gedaliah; and thus he polluted his hands with innocent blood
at the sacred table, having paid no regard to the rights of hospitality. Now the
Prophet shews that this was fatal to the miserable remnant, who were permitted
to dwell in the land. For, first, it could not have been done without exciting
the highest indignation of the king of Babylon, for he had set Gedaliah over the
land; and it was not expressed without reason, but emphatically, that this
slaughter roused the displeasure of the king of Babylon, because the murder of
Gedaliah was a manifest contempt of his authority. And then there was another
cause of displeasure, for the Chal-deans in Mizpah, who had been given as
protectors, were killed. For the Prophet tells us, that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>men of
war</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that no one might think that
Chaldeans were sent there to occupy the place of the Jews, as it is sometimes
the case when colonists or some such men settle in a land: they were military
men, who had been chosen as a guard and protection to Gedaliah. Thus then was
the wrath of the king of Babylon provoked to. vent his rage on the remnant to
whom he had shewed mercy. It now follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet skews here, that after Ishmael had
polluted his hands, he made no end of his barbarity. And thus wicked men become
hardened; for even if they dread at first to murder innocent men, when once they
begin the work, they rush on to the commission of numberless murders. This is
what the Prophet now tells us had happened; for after Gedaliah was killed, he
says, that <i>eighty men came
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from Shechem, from Shiloh,
and from Samaria</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>who brought incense
and offering, to present them in the Temple, and that these were led by
treachery to Mizpah, there killed and cast into a pit, as we shall hereafter
see.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is not known by what cause Ishmael was induced to
commit this cruel and barbarous act, for there was no war declared, nor could he
have pretended any excuse for thus slaying unhappy men, who apprehended no such
thing. They were of the seed of Abraham, they were worshippers of God, and then
they had committed no offense, and plotted nothing against him. Why then he was
seized with such rage is uncertain, except that wicked men, as we have said,
never set any bounds to their crimes; for God gives theta the spirit of
giddiness, so that they are carried away by blind madness. It is, indeed,
probable, that they were killed, because Ishmael thought that they carne to
Gedaliah, that they might live under his protection, and that he could not have
gained anything by the murder of one man, except he obtained authority over the
whole land. It was then suspicion alone, and that indeed slight, which led him
to such a cruelty. And the atrocity of the deed was enhanced by what the Prophet
says, that they came to offer to God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>incense and
offering</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hjnm</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
meneche</i>: and he says also, that they had their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>beards
shaven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>garments
torn</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Such an appearance ought to have
roused pity even in the most inveterate enemies; for we know, that there is an
innate feeling which leads us to pity
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wretchedness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and tears, and every mournful appearance. The fury then of Ishmael, even if
he had before determined to do some grievous thing to these men, ought to have
been allayed by their very sight, so as not to be even angry with them.
According then to every view of the case, we see that he must have been divested
of every sense of equity, and that he was more cruel than any wild
beast.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be asked, How did these men come for the
purpose mentioned, since the report respecting the destruction of the Temple
must have spread everywhere? for they are not said to have come from Persia, or
from countries beyond the sea; but that they came from places not afar off. They
who answer that the report of the Temple being destroyed had not reached them,
only seek to escape, but the answer is not credible, and it is only an evasion.
The Temple was burnt in the fifth month; could that calamity be unknown in
Judea? And then we know that Shiloh was not far from Jerusalem, nor was Samaria
very distant. Since then the distance of these places cannot account for their
ignorance, it seems not to me probable, that these came, because they thought
that the Temple was still standing, nor did they bring victims, but only incense
and oblation. I then think that they came, not to offer the ordinary sacrifice,
but only that they might testify their piety in that place where they had before
offered their sacrifices. This conjecture has nothing inconsistent in it; nor is
there a doubt, but that before they left their homes, they had put on their mean
and torn garments. These were signs, as we have elsewhere seen, of sorrow and
mourning among the Orientals.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here another question is raised, for the Prophet
says, that they were <i>torn </i>or cut; and this has been deemed as referring
to the skin or body: but this was forbidden by the Law. Some answer that they
forgot the Law in their extreme grief, so that they undesignedly tore or
lacerated their bodies. But the prohibition of the Law seems to me to have had
something special in it, even that God designed by it to distinguish his people
from heathens. And we may gather from sacred history, that some artifice was
practiced by idolaters, when they cut their bodies; for it is said, that the
priests of Baal cut their bodies according to their usual manner or practice.
God then, wishing to keep his people from every corruption, forbade them to
imitate the rites of the heathens. And then there is no doubt but that God
designed to correct excess in grief and mourning. I therefore do not think that
anything contrary to the Law was done by these men, when they came to the ruins
of the Temple with torn garments and lacerated skin, for there was in them
nothing affected, for so lamentable a calamity drew forth such grief, that they
spared neither themselves nor their garments.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah says, in the first of these verses, that the
death of Gedaliah was concealed, so that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>no one knew
it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>yet such a deed could have been
hardly buried; for many of the Jews were killed together with Gedaliah, and also
the guarding soldiers, whom Nebuchadnezzar had given to Gedaliah. But the
Prophet means that it was hid, because the report had not yet gone forth. He
then speaks comparatively, when he says that it was known to none. We have
already stated the purpose for which the eighty men came from Samaria and other
places; it was not that they might offer sacrifices, as when the Temple was
standing, but only lament the destruction of the Temple and of the city; and
that as they had brought from home the greatest sorrow, they might, on their
return, humble themselves, after having seen so grievous a punishment inflicted
on the people for their sins.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">HERE Jeremiah relates another circumstance in the
nefarious conduct of Ishmael, that by flatteries he enticed simple men, who
feared no evil, and while pretending kindness, slew them. The slaughter was in
itself very detestable, but added to it was the most abominable deceit, for he
pretended to weep with them, and offered an act of kindness, to bring them to
Gedaliah, and then he traitorously killed them! We hence see that it was an act
of extreme wickedness. In saying that he <i>wept, </i>it was no doubt a sign of
feigned piety,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fG12</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He saw
these good men in torn garments and in tears on account of the Temple being
destroyed, he therefore pretended that he had the same feeling. This was falsely
to pretend a regard for God, and his tears were those of the crocodile; for he
shed tears as though he lamented the ruin of the Temple and of the city. He thus
gained the confidence of the unwary men, and then after having led them into the
middle of the city, he slew them. The place also is mentioned,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>nigh to the middle of the
pit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>for so I render it, rather than
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the
middle</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>for it is not credible that he
killed them in the pit itself; but when led to the pit they were killed and were
cast into it, as we shall see.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fG13</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He then
slew them at the outside of the pit, and immediately cast them
in.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may, however be asked, Whether he could with so
few attack with success so many men? for it seems strange, that as they were
eighty men they did not resist; they might at least have frightened their
enemies. But we must, in the first place, recollect that they were, as we have
seen, unarmed; for they had brought only a sacred offering with incense; but the
others were armed and well trained for war; they had also been reduced to a
state of hopeless despair, so that they had doubtless contracted great ferocity,
as those who are continually in danger accustom themselves to acts of cruelty.
Ishmael, then, and his companions were armed, but the others were without any
arms, and were also simple men and in no degree accustomed to war. Hence it was
that they were killed like sheep, while Ishmael and his associates were like
wolves, altogether ferocious. It now follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">We here see that the barbarity of Ishmael was
connected with avarice, he was indeed inflamed with ferocious madness when he
slew simple and innocent men; but when the hope of gain was presented to him, he
spared some of them. Thus then we see that he was a lion, a wolf, or a bear in
savageness, but that he was also a hungry man, for as soon as he smelt the odor
of prey, he spared ten out of the eighty, who, it is probable, thus redeemed
their life and returned home. So in one man we see there were many monsters; for
if he hated all those who favored Gedaliah, why did he suffer these to escape?
even because avarice and rapacity prevailed in him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is then added, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>slew them not in the midst of
their brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, when they were
exposed to death and were mixed with the others, so that their condition seems
to have been the same. The Prophet says, that they were spared, even because
Ishmael sought nothing else but gain. And it is probable that in a state of
things so disturbed he was not furnished with provisions and other things. As,
then, want urged him, so he became moderate, lest his cruelty should cause a
loss to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here also is set before us the inscrutable purpose of
God, that he suffered unhappy men to have been thus slain by robbers. They had
left. their houses to lament the burning of the Temple. As then the ardor of
their piety led them to Jerusalem, how unworthy it was that they should become a
prey to the barbarity of Ishmael and his associates? But as we said yesterday,
God has hidden ways by which he provides for the salvation of his people. He
took away Gedaliah; his end indeed was sad, having been slain by Ishmael whom he
had hospitably entertained. Thus God did not suffer him to be tossed about in
the midst of great troubles. For John, the son of Kareah, who yet was a most
faithful man, would have become soon troublesome to the holy man; for he became
soon after the head and ringleader of an impious faction, and ferociously
opposed Jeremiah. Had then Gedaliah lived, he would have been assailed on every
side by his own people. It was then God&#8217;s purpose to free him at once from
all these miserable troubles. The same thing also happened to the seventy who
were slain; for the Lord removed them to their rest, that they might; not be
exposed to the grievous evils and calamities which afterwards soon followed; for
none could have been in a more miserable state than the remnant whom
Nebuchadnezzar had spared. We have then reason in this instance to admire the
secret purpose of God, when we see that these unhappy men were killed, who yet
had gone to Jerusalem for the sake of testifying their piety. It was, in short,
better for them to have been removed than to have been under the necessity of
suffering again many miseries. It now follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet tells us by the way that the trench was
made by King Asa, when he fortified the city against the attack of Baasha, as it
is related in the sixteenth chapter of Second Chronicles. For Baasha, having
collected an army, made an attack on the land of Judah and began to build the
city, that he might thus keep the Jews as it were besieged, and make thence
daily incursions, and where he might safely take his forces together with the
spoils. Asa then hired the king of Syria, and induced him to break the treaty
which the two kings of Syria and Israel had made with one another. Thus Baasha
was forced to leave the work unfinished, and thence Asa is said to have carried
away the gathered stones, that thereby the trench might be formed. There is
indeed no mention of the trench; but we may conclude that it was then formed, in
order that it might interpose between the enemy and the city. But it may seem
strange that the trench was in the midst of the city, except perhaps that Asa
built a fortress within the town, that if he was overcome by his enemy, he might
take refuge there with his men of war, as we know that citadels are often built
in the middle of cities as fortresses, as places of refuge. Asa then built this
trench, that should the king of Israel take the city, he might not penetrate
farther, but be kept back by the interposing trench. But only in things
uncertain are conjectures to be allowed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet increases the indignity of the deed,
when he says, that the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>trench was
filled with the slain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It was formed for
a very different end and purpose, even that the king of Judah, when reduced to
the greatest straits, might have the trench as a defense against the violence of
his enemies, so that he might protect his kingdom and his subjects. But now the
slain were cast into the trench, not the Syrians nor the Israelites, but Jews
themselves and God&#8217;s pious worshipers. What then had been made for the
public benefit of the people, was made by Ishmael a place for the slaughter of
good men. And hence, as it has been said, the atrocity of the deed was more
enhanced. It afterwards follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">It is not known whether Ishmael had this design at
the beginning, or whether, when he saw that he had no power to stand his ground,
he took the captives with him, that he might dwell with the king of Ammon. It
is, however, probable that this was done according to a previous resolution, and
that before he slew Gedaliah, it was determined that the remnant should be drawn
away to that country. Perhaps the king of Ammon wished to send some of his own
people to dwell in Judea; thus he hoped to become the ruler of Judea, and also
hoped to pacify the king of Babylon by becoming his tributary. It was, however,
a great thing to possess a land so fertile. However this may have been, there is
no doubt but that the king of Ammon hoped for something great after the death of
Gedaliah. And it is probable that for this reason the people were drawn away, to
whom an habitation in Judea had been permitted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now tells us, that Ishmael <i>took
</i>the remnant of the people <i>captives. </i>And it appears that in a short
time he had a greater force than at the beginning; for he could not with a few
men collect the people, for the number of those who had been left, as we have
seen, was not inconsiderable: and they were dispersed through many towns; and
Ishmael could not have prevailed on them by his command alone to remove to the
land of Ammon. But after he had killed Gedaliah, his barbarity frightened them
all, and no doubt many joined him; for an impious faction ever finds many
followers when any hope is offered them. All then who were miserable among the
people followed him as their leader; and thus he was able to lead away the whole
people as captives.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here again a question arises, that is, respecting
the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>daughters of the
king;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for the poor and the obscure, who
were of the lowest class, had alone been left; and the royal seed, as we have
seen, had been carried away. But it is probable that some of the king&#8217;s
daughters had escaped when the city was besieged; for Ishmael himself was of the
royal seed, but he had escaped before the city was taken. Nebuchadnezzar then
could not have had him as a captive. The same was the case with the daughters of
the king, whom Zedekiah might have sent to some secure places. And Ge-daliah
afterwards brought them together when he saw that it could be done without
danger or hazard of exciting suspicion: he had indeed obtained this power, as we
have before seen, from Nebuzaradan. Though then Gedaliah ruled over the poor and
those of no repute, yet the daughters of the king, who had been removed to
quieter places, afterwards dwelt with him; and so Ishmael, and John the son of
Kareah, and other leaders of the army, came to him: the reason was the
same.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is again repeated,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and all the people that remained
in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan had committed to
Gedaliah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, over whom he appointed
Gedaliah, as we have before seen. But the repetition was not made without
reason; for Jeremiah expressed again what was worthy of special notice, that the
fury and violence of Ishmael were so great that he did not see that the mind of
Nebuchadnezzar would be so exasperated as to become implacable; but his madness
was so furious that he had no regard for himself nor for
others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>took away captive
the</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>people, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>went that he might pass over to
the children of Ammon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Thus their
condition was much worse than if they had been driven into exile; for the
Ammonites were in no degree more kind than the Chaldeans; nay, they were exposed
there, as we shall hereafter see, to greater reproaches; it would indeed have
been better for them and more tolerable, had they been at once killed, than to
have been thus removed to an exile the most miserable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It hence appears that Ishmael was wholly devoid of
all humane feelings, having been thus capable of the impiety of betraying the
children of Abraham. For where there is ambition, it often happens that a lust
for empire impels men to deeds of great enormity; but to draw away unhappy
people to the Ammonites was certainly an act more than
monstrous.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the people, we shall hereafter see that they
deserved all their reproaches and miseries; and this calamity did not happen to
them except through the righteous providence of God. For though they were freed,
as we shall see, by the son of Kareah, yet they soon went into Egypt,
notwithstanding the remonstrances of the Prophet, and his severe denunciations
in case they removed there. Though then the base and monstrous cruelty of
Ishmael is here set before us, let us yet know that the Jews deserved to be
driven away into exile, and to be subjected to all kinds of
miseries.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Oh, miserable sentence! when it is said, that there
were slain seventy men </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the

slain in like manner with him, as it were in addition to the wound he

<div><font face="Palatino">Ishmael had not only killed a man, but the governor
of the people, and that governor by whose protection and favor a remnant had
been preserved as a seed; and he had also killed all whom he had found with him;
and lastly, he had killed seventy men, with whom he had no strife, no war, no
quarrel. As, then, Ishmael had so polluted himself with innocent blood, and with
so many murders of good men, how was it that he was suffered to
escape?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As we have before said, God does not now observe an
equal, or the same course in his judgments; for he often extends the life of the
most wicked, that they may be exhibited, as it were, as a spectacle; nor does
the truth of the words, &#8220;Whosoever sheds man&#8217;s blood, his blood
shall be shed,&#8221; become evanescent; but God has various ways by which he
renders a just reward to murderers and assassins. And we ought to notice what is
said in the book of Psalms,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Slay them not,
lest my people should
forget.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;195911&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
59:11)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Psalmist there asks God not to destroy
immediately the wicked; for an oblivion of a remarkable punishment might easily
creep in, if God executed it suddenly and instantly. But when God impresses a
mark of his curse on the impious and the wicked, and prolongs their life, it is
the same as though he placed them in a theater to be looked on leisurely and for
a long time. Conspicuous, then, are the marks of God on the impious, when God
pursues them slowly and by degrees, and summons them, in a manner, day by day
before his tribunal. There is, therefore, no doubt but that God thus executed
vengeance on the barbarity of Ishmael.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For how was it that he killed Gedaliah? even because
he was of the royal seed, and foolish pride still filled his heart, though God
by his powerful hand had broken down whatever dignity that once belonged to the
royal seed, <i>sea, he </i>had completely torn it to pieces; and yet this man
<i>cherished </i>his own ferocity. Hence God executed on him a two-fold
punishment, by depriving him of his company; for he went to the king of Ammon,
whom he had no doubt flattered with great promises, and from whom he also
<i>expected </i>no common rewards, &#8212; he went there a fugitive with his
eight companions, and also filled with confusion, and he saw no hope of a
return. Thus, then, it happened that he was despised and reprobated; and this
was, no doubt, more bitter to him than if he had suffered ten
deaths.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us then learn not to form our judgment according
to the present appearance of things; but let us patiently wait while God makes
openly known to us the various ways he adopts in punishing the wicked; nay, this
ought <i>especially </i>to serve as a confirmation to our faith, when we see the
godly cruelly slain, and the wicked remaining in security; for it hence follows
that we are to look for another judgment of God, which does not yet appear. For
if God rendered to each his just reward, then the Sadducees would have some
ground to boast that there is not another life; but when things are thus in a
state of confusion in the world, we know that God&#8217;s judgment is suspended
and deferred to another time. Then this variety or confusion, if you please,
confirms our minds in the hope of the last judgment, and of a blessed
resurrection. I cannot now proceed further.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Grant, omnipotent God, that as this
world is filled with the filth of the wicked, and as we are on every side
surrounded with enemies, &#8212; O grant, that we may learn to flee under thy
protection, and so hide ourselves under the shadow of thy wings, that we may
look nowhere else for safety but from thy defense; and that we may also know
that as to everything that happens to us, our life and our death are so ordered
by thy wonderful providence, that all events help forward our salvation, so that
we may go onward, not only through many calamities, but, if need be, through the
midst of slaughters, until we shall come to that blessed rest, which thine
only-begotten Son has obtained for us by his own blood. &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">THE Prophet now shews, that though some kind of
virtue appeared in John the son of Kareah, he was not yet of a right mind. He
was an energetic and a <i>discreet </i>man, but he discovered his unbelief, when
he led the remnant of the people into Egypt, while the Prophet was forbidding
such a thing. He already knew that this was not lawful, but his obstinacy was
two-fold more, when the Prophet repudiated his project, as we shall see. This
passage then teaches us, that though the leaders of the forces, who had put
Ishmael to flight, and avenged his perfidy, were men of courage, and shewed
regard for the public good, they were destitute of faith: there was thus wanting
in them the chief thing, that is piety and the fear of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then the Prophet says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>John
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and the rest <i>took
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the remnant of the people
whom they had recovered from Ishmael, from
Mizpah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>not that they were recovered
from that place, but that Ishmael had brought the unhappy people captives from
Mizpah, as we have seen; but they had all been recovered at Gibeon, according to
what is said at the end of the verse. But he says that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>valiant
men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yrbg</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

follows,) and men <i>of war,
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">y&ccedil;na
hmjlmh</font><font face="Palatino"><i>, anushi emelecheme. </i>He then calls
them <i>valiant </i>or brave, and afterwards he explains what that virtue was,
even because they were warlike men. He says further, that there were <i>women
</i>mixed with them, and <i>children, </i>and <i>eunuchs, </i>who once lived in
the king&#8217;s court; and as we have before seen, there were among them the
king&#8217;s daughters. Gedaliah then had collected together a considerable
number of men, not only from the lower orders, but also from the higher class,
whose wealth and rank were not common while the kingdom was
standing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet immediately adds what the purpose was
which they had all formed. They dwelt, he says, <i>in Geruth; </i>some render
it, <i>&#8220;in </i>the peregrination;<i>&#8221; </i>but it seems to me to be a
proper name, and I agree with those who so render it.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fG17</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But it
is called the <i>Geruth of Chimham, </i>of whom mention is made in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;101931&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 19:31, 37. he was the son of Barzillai, who entertained David when a
fugitive from his kingdom, and entertained him bountifully. When David wished to
remunerate his kindness, the good man made his age as an excuse, and said, that
he was old, so that he could not enjoy the things of this life; but he presented
his son to David, and it is probable that this place was given to the son as a
reward. It was hence called Geruth-Chimham, the name of its possessor being
attached to it. And he says that it was <i>nigh Bethlehem. </i>It is also
probable, that when David wished to remunerate his host, he chose a place nigh
his own city, where he was born.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
go</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. Then the Prophet shews that
this was not a settled habitation, but that they intended to go into
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>They knew that this was forbidden by the Law of God, and the Prophets had
often pronounced a curse on such a design. Notwithstanding God&#8217;s
prohibition, they prepared themselves for the journey. Fear was the cause; but
how much so ever they might have justly feared, they ought yet to have
considered what God permitted: for if a sick man takes poison instead of
medicine, he must suffer the punishment that necessarily follows his own
presumption and madness; so they who seek to provide for themselves contrary to
God&#8217;s will, gain only their own destruction. This was done, as the Prophet
tells us, by the remnant of the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says, that they were there for a time, but
that they looked forward to Egypt, on <i>account, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the
Chaldeans</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because they feared them, and
for this reason, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because Ishmael
had killed Gedaliah, whom Nebuchadnezzar had set over the
land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This fear was not without reason;
but they might have sent persons to the king of Babylon, and have thrown the
blame on the right person, and cleared themselves; and the matter might have
been settled. They might then have easily obtained pardon from King
Nebuchadnezzar; but as no fear of God prevailed in them, they did not consider
what was lawful, and were by a blind impulse led into Egypt. Thus fear was no
alleviation to their crime, for there was another remedy at hand, which God
would have blessed. But when they disregarded God&#8217;s word, and followed
what their own feelings dictated to them, they contrived in a very bad way for
themselves. But far worse is what follows.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">I have said that John, and his associates, and the
whole people acted much more culpably by coming to the Prophet, than if they had
not done so, and had gone directly to Egypt: for they either came dissemblingly,
and thus designedly spoke what was false, or they were extremely stupid, and
hypocrisy had wholly deprived them of their understanding. They came to the
Prophet to ask counsel; nay, that he might be to them God&#8217;s interpreter,
and that thus they might know what to do; and they promised to obey, as we shall
hereafter see. However this may have been, they sought an oracle in which it was
their duty to acquiesce, except they resolved openly to shake off the yoke and
to show themselves to be gross and profane despisers of God. They came to the
Prophet, when yet it was their fixed purpose, as we shall see, to go to
Egypt.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He who asks counsel, ought first to see that he bring
no prejudice, but be free and honest: but it is, however, a fault too common,
that men deliberate and ask counsel, when they have already settled what to do;
nay, nothing is more common than this; for those who consult do not, for the
most part, wish to learn what is right, but that others should fall in with
their own inclinations. He who has resolved on this or that point, pretends that
he is in doubt, and held in suspense; he asks what ought to be done: if the
answer be according to his wishes, he embraces what is said; but if he who is
consulted, disapproves of what he has already resolved to do, he rejects the
counsel given. Such was the dissimulation described by the Prophet, when the
leaders of the forces and the whole people came to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He mentions, first, the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>leaders of the
forces</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>John the son of Kareah, and
Jezaniah the son of Hoshiah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He adds
these two last; but it was to give them honor, as when the angel
said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Go and tell his
disciples and Peter.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;411607&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Mark
16:7)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He did not put aside Peter, as though he was inferior
to all the rest; but for the sake of honor he mentions his name, after having
spoken generally of them all. So also here, the Prophet names generally the
<i>leaders, </i>but as John the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah were the chief men,
he expressly gives their names. He adds, the whole people,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the least to the
greatest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This does not refer to age;
but what he means is, that all, of every grade, came with one consent to
Jeremiah. It was not then the conspiring of a few men, but all from the least to
the greatest had resolved to go to Egypt; and yet they came, as though with an
honest purpose, to the Prophet; wherefore? They wished their own perverse design
to be approved by God, and thus to subject God to their own will and humor; for
they did not suffer themselves to be ruled by his Spirit, but audaciously
disregarded his word. The Prophet then shews that they were all implicated in
the same sin.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is added, that they <i>said, </i>as though they
were ready to obey, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let our
prayer fall before thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This, as we
have said, when addressed to God, is an <i>evidence </i>of humility; but it is
applied here to man; and when the Hebrews make a humble request, they say,
&#8220;Let my prayer fall before <i>thee,&#8221; </i>that is, Hear what I
suppliantly and humbly ask.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pray</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>they said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to Jehovah thy God
for us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>They called him the God of
Jeremiah, not that they intended to exempt themselves from his authority; they
did not mean that they were alienated from God; but in this way they extolled
Jeremiah, and acknowledged him to be God&#8217;s true and lawful Prophet. In
short, this saying refers to the prophetic office, as though they had said, that
Jeremiah had hitherto confirmed his vocation, so that it was clearly evident
that he had been sent from above.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see why they called Jehovah the <i>God
</i>of Jeremiah, not as though they had rejected God, and as though he was not
their God in common with Jeremiah, but they allowed that the Prophet possessed a
higher honor, and that his faithfulness and integrity were beyond
controversy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this admission justly recoiled on their own head;
for if Jeremiah was God&#8217;s Prophet, why did they not instantly obey him,
after knowing that what he faithfully told them he had received from God? and
why did they insolently and ferociously resist him and accuse him of falsehood?
Their own admission then was not sincere, but a fallacious flattery, as is the
case with all hypocrites, who never speak in sincerity and
truth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They afterwards added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pray for all this remnant, for we
are left, a few from many</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This they
added to produce pity, in order that they might more easily obtain from Jeremiah
what they asked; nor was that difficult; but as they felt conscious of wrong,
they sought the favor of the Prophet by flatteries, Had they asked him without
disguise, they knew that he was of himself disposed to seek the well being of
the people; but as they were of a double mind, they set before him their
miserable state, which might; have roused the Prophet still more to make
intercession to God for them. And for this reason they added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as thine eyes see
us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And they set before him this sad
spectacle, to create sympathy in the Prophet. And it then follows, And <i>may
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah thy God shew us the
way </i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>in which we are to walk. </i>They now
explained more clearly why they wished prayer to be made for them, even that God
might answer and shew what he wished them to do.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They came then, as it has been stated, as though they
were ready to obey; and then they professed humility, because they did not wish
to do anything rashly, but only to follow where God called them. Had they spoken
from the heart, it would have been a rare virtue thus to-have fled in
perplexities to God, and to have allowed themselves to be ruled by his word; but
we shall see that it was all a pre-tence. We have then here set before us the
hypocrisy of that people, so that we may learn that whenever we ask what pleases
God, we should bring a pure and sincere heart, so that nothing may prevent or
hinder us immediately to embrace whatever God may command us. But their
hypocrisy is discovered to have been still baser, when the Prophet
adds,</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have
heard</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I will pray according to
your words</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There is no doubt but that
he thus intimated that he wished well to them; and it might have rendered them
more attentive to the oracle to know that the Prophet was influenced by love.
Nor is there a doubt but that the Prophet testified his love towards them, that
his doctrine might afterwards have more weight with them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whatever your God will
answer</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he did not mean that the oracle
would be revealed to all, for the words could not be otherwise explained than
through the Prophet, who would openly make known to the whole people what he
heard from God&#8217;s mouth. But he says, that the answer would be given to
them, because God would give the answer which was to be communicated to all, as
it is said that God spoke to Moses, and also to all the people, for the doctrine
was intended for all. Moses did not receive the law, nor its interpretation, in
his own private character, but in order that the people might know what was
right. So Jeremiah did here; the answer he received from God he made known as
belonging in common to all the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But in calling God <i>their God, </i>he did not mean
to flatter them or to praise their piety, but to exhort them to surrender and
devote themselves wholly to God, as though he had said, that they had to do with
God, who had bound them to himself when he adopted them as his peculiar people,
and then favored them with so many blessings. Since then God had made himself
known to them, they could not reject his counsel with impunity, for there was no
pretext of ignorance. We hence see what weight there is in this,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>your
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for Jeremiah reminded them that
they could not with impunity trifle with God, for they were not their own, but
had been chosen to be God&#8217;s people, and on this condition, to be wholly
subject to his authority. Then the sum of the whole is this, that the Prophet
would faithfully convey to the Jews the answer God would give them; and he said
this that his doctrine might have a greater authority among them. It now

<div><font face="Palatino">It hence appears that the people understood for what
purpose Jeremiah, before he consulted God, assured them of his faithfulness and
sincerity; for it was not without reason that they promised to be obedient to
God; but as they saw that they were suspected as being not sincere by Jeremiah,
and as he had promised to be a true and faithful teacher, they on the other hand
declared that they would be sincere disciples, and would receive whatever God
might command them. But they soon betrayed their perfidy, for when they heard
that what they had resolved to do did not please God, they not only rejected the
counsel of God and the Prophet, but treated him insolently, and even loaded the
holy man with reproaches, as though he had told them what was false. Their
hypocrisy ought at the same time to be a lesson to us, so that when God is
pleased through a singular favor to shew us the way of acting rightly by
faithful instructors and competent teachers, we may not be like them, but be
teachable and ready to obey, and prove this not only by the mouth but also by
our deeds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet then says, that they spoke thus,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let God be a faithful and true
witness between us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Being not content
with a simple affirmation, they dared to interpose the name of God; and thus we
see how blind is hypocrisy. For if men duly weigh what it is to profane
God&#8217;s name, surely they would dread and abominate all perjury. As then
they rushed on so audaciously to swear, it is evident that they were as it were
stupefied; and there is no inebriety which so confuses the minds of men and all
their senses as hypocrisy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They then added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to whatever word which
Jehovah thy God shall send to us, so will we
do,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, whatever Jehovah shall
command us by thee; for God is said to send to men, when he sends a messenger in
his name to bring his commands. Jeremiah then was, as it were, a middle person
to address the people in God&#8217;s name, as though he had been sent from
heaven. They therefore said, that they would do whatever God commanded. A
stronger expression follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whether good or evil, we will
obey the voice of Jehovah our God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>They
did not here charge God&#8217;s word with being wrong, as though it had anything
unjust in it; but they used <i>good </i>in the sense of joyful, and <i>evil
</i>as meaning what is sad or grievous, as though they had said, that they asked
for no other thing but that God should declare what pleased him, and that they
were so submissive as to refuse nothing though contrary to the flesh. Had this
declaration proceeded from the heart, it would have been a testimony of true
piety; for the minds of the godly ought to be so framed as to obey God without
making any exception, whether he commands what is contrary to their purpose, or
leads them where they do not wish to go; for they who wish to make a compact
with God, that he should require nothing but what is agreeable to them, shew
that they know not what it is to serve God. Hence the obedience of faith in an
especial manner requires this, that man should <i>renounce </i>his own desires,
that he should not set up his own counsels and wishes against the word of God,
nor object and say, this is hard, that is not quite agreeable.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whether
</i></font><font face="Palatino">then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it be good
</i></font><font face="Palatino">or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>evil</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that is, though it may be contrary to the feelings of the flesh, we ought
still to embrace what God requires and commands: this is the rule of true
religion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As the Jews spoke feignedly by assuming a character
not their own, they profaned God&#8217;s name. But if we desire to prove our
fidelity to God, the only way of acting is, to regard his word as binding,
whether it be agreeable or otherwise, and never to murmur, as the ungodly do;
for when God would have a yoke laid on them, they complain that his doctrine is
too hard and burdensome. Away, then, with all those things which can render
God&#8217;s word unacceptable to us, if we desire to give a sure proof of our
fidelity. Hence they said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whether it be good or
evil</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>what God will lay down we will
obey his voice.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They afterwards added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For which we send thee to
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fG18</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Here they still further cast themselves into toils. Jeremiah did not in
express words require them to make an oath; they yet did make an oath; and then
in various ways still more bound themselves over to punishment, if they became
perjurers. They now shew that it would be a two-fold crime, should they disobey
God; how? Had the Prophet been sent to them, they might have made excuses;
though vain, they might yet have something to allege; but when they of their own
accord asked God, when they offered of themselves to do this, and promised to be
obedient in all things, it is evident that unless afterwards they acted
according to their pledged faith, they must have been more inexcusable, because
they tempted God: for who induced them to come to the Prophet? We hence see that
God extorted from them what doubled their crime. But the more hypocrites attempt
by disguises to conceal their impiety, the faster they bind themselves, and the
more they kindle God&#8217;s wrath against themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They then added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That it may be well with us when
we obey the voice of Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By this
circumstance also they aggravated their crime. For if the Prophet had promised
them a prosperous issue, they might not have believed; in that case they would
have indeed sinned; but their wicked-ness would have been more tolerable than
when they themselves had spoken, as though they were the organs of the Holy
Spirit; they said themselves, It <i>shall
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>be well with
us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>it will be our chief happiness to
follow the voice of God and to obey him. As, then, they thus protested to God
and the Prophet, that they might appear to be God&#8217;s faithful servants, the
greater condemnation they brought on themselves; for if they believed that
not]ting would turn out happily, except according to God&#8217;s command, how
was it that they did not submit to God? why did they despise what was afterwards
said by the Prophet? But as we have already said, as they deceived themselves by
dealing falsely with God and profaning his holy name, let us learn and know that
we can in no other way expect a happy issue in all that we do, but by obeying
the voice of God; for whatever men may attempt of themselves, it will be
accursed before God. This, then, is our only sure hope, that when we attempt
nothing but what is according to God&#8217;s word, there will be a good and
happy issue, though many things may happen otherwise than we hope or
think.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">HERE Jeremiah declares what answer he received from
God; and he gave it in his name to the leaders of the forces and to the whole
people. The answer was, that they were to continue in the land; for this would
be for their good. We shall hereafter see, that they had falsely asked counsel
of God, whom they had resolved not to obey, as it has been already stated. But
the Prophet shews again more clearly how perversely they acted after God had
commanded them to remain quiet, and especially not to proceed to
Egypt.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now he says, that at the <i>tenth day </i>God
answered him. He might have done so immediately, but he deferred, that the
prophecy might have more weight. Had the Prophet been asked any question
respecting the common rule of life, as a faithful expounder of the Law, he might
have explained to them what their duty was; but as he had been asked on a
special subject, he could not have immediately answered them. And God, as I have
said, kept them for a time in suspense; not only that the Prophet&#8217;s answer
might be made without ostentation, but also that. the people might embrace as
coming from God what the Prophet would say; for his doctrine could not have been
doubted, for he did not instantly bring forth what had arisen in his own head,
but prayerfully waited to know what pleased God, and at length announced his
commands. We now then perceive the cause of delay, why God did not immediately
convey to his servant the answer required.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us at the same time learn from this passage, that
if God does not immediately extricate us from all perplexity and doubt, we ought
patiently to wait, according to the direction of Paul, who, when speaking of
doctrine, admonished the faithful to remain contented until what they knew not
should be revealed to them.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;500315&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
3:15.) Much more should we do so, when we ask counsel as to any particular
thing. When God does not immediately make known to us what we ask, we ought, as
I have already said, to wait with calm and resigned minds for the time and the
season when it shall be made known to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah says, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>called John and the other leaders
of the forces and all the people, from the least to the
greatest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is expressed that we may
know that it happened, not through the fault of one or two, that this prophecy
was disregarded, but that all the people were united together. The people
<i>themselves, </i>then, could not have pretended that they were free from
blame; for we see that they were all implicated. The leaders are particularly
mentioned, and on the other hand the people, so that the leaders could not
object and say that they were forced by a popular tumult, nor could the people
throw the blame on the leaders. The Prophet then shews that they all rebelled
against God, and that there was no exception.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says that he faithfully related to them what
God had commanded, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith
Jehovah, the God of Israel, to whom you sent
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By this circumstance he shews that
they were more bound to obey; for if God had sent his Prophet to them,&#8217;
they ought to have obeyed his voice; but when they of their own accord <i>came
to </i>him and prayed for a favor, and wished God&#8217;s will to be made known
to them, they became doubly culpable when they refused the answer given them in
God&#8217;s name. And he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That I might
prostrate,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or make to fall,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>your prayer before
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We have stated what is meant by
this mode of speaking; but there is a difference to be noticed, for he had been
requested sup-pliantly to ask God; and he says here that he had not only prayed,
but had presented the prayer of the whole people, because he acted for the
public; and then he was a middle person between God and the people. On this
account he says, that he had been <i>seat </i>to present the prayer of the
people to God, for he asked nothing for himself, but acted for them all, and
asked God to answer the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If remaining ye will remain in
this land, I will build you up and plant you, I will not pull you down nor root
you up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here the Prophet testifies that
the counsel he gave them in God&#8217;s name would be for their good; and what
is good or useful is deemed by men, when they theorize, as they say, to be of
great value. The simple authority of God ought, indeed, to be sufficient; and
had God only commanded them in one word to remain, they ought to have
acquiesced. But God here accommodated himself to their infirmity, and was
pleased, in a manner, to let himself down in order to promote their well being,
and did not require obedience according to his authority and sovereign power, as
he might have justly done. We hence see how kindly God dealt with this people,
as he did not demand what he might, but gave his counsel, and testified that it
would be good and useful to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now when orators adduce what is useful in order to
persuade, they have recourse to conjectures, they state human reasons; but the
Prophet here promised in God&#8217;s name, that that if they remained it would
be for their good. God&#8217;s promise, then, is brought forward here instead of
conjectures and reasons. Therefore the obstinacy of the people was without
excuse, when they rejected the authority of God; and then despised his counsel,
and also disbelieved his promise. Then to the contempt of God was added
unbelief: and we know that no greater reproach can be offered to God than when
men do not believe him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The metaphors here used occur often in Scripture. God
is said to <i>build up </i>men when he confirms them in a settled state; and in
the same sense he is said to <i>plant </i>them. This we have already seen, and
it is especially evident from
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;194402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
44:2, where God is said to have &#8220;planted&#8221; in the land of Canaan the
people he had brought out of Egypt. He then promised that the condition of the
people would be secure, and safe, and perpetual, if only they did not change
their place. When he adds, I will
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not pull down
</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>nor
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pluck
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he: follows what is done commonly in
Hebrew. Neither the Latins nor the Greeks speak in this manner; but negatives of
this kind in Hebrew are confirmations, as though the Prophet had said,
&#8220;God will so plant you that your root will remain. There will then be no
danger of being plucked up when you have been planted by God&#8217;s hand; nor
will he suffer you to be subverted or pulled down when he has built you up by
his own hand.&#8221; What then they ought to have especially sought, God freely
promised them, even to be safe and secure in the land; for this especially was
what the Prophet meant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It afterwards follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I repent of the evil
</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>which I have brought on you. </i>The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;jn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nuchem, </i>sometimes means to repent, and often to comfort; but the former
sense comports better with this passage, that God repented of the evil. If,
however, we prefer this rendering, &#8220;For I have received comfort,&#8221;
then the meaning would be, &#8220;I am satisfied with the punishment with which
I have visited your sins;&#8221; for they to whom satisfaction is given are said
to receive comfort. As then God was content with the punishment he had inflicted
on the Jews, the words may be rendered thus, &#8220;For I have received
satisfaction from the evil,&#8221; or, &#8220;I am satisfied with the
evil,&#8221; etc. The other meaning, however, is more generally taken, that God
repented of the evil.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fG19</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But
this mode of speaking is, indeed, somewhat harsh, yet it contains nothing
contrary to the truth; for we know that God often transfers to himself what
peculiarly belongs to man. Then repentance in God is nothing else than that
having been pacified, he does not pursue men to an extremity, so as to demand
the punishment which they justly deserve. Thus, then, God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>repented of the
evil</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which he had brought on the people,
after having sufficiently chastised their sins, according to what we read in
Isaiah, when God says, that he had exacted double for their sins.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234002&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
40:2.) He called the punishment he had inflicted double, not that it exceeded a
just measure, but he spoke according to his paternal feeling, that he had
treated his people in a harder way than he wished, as a father, who is even
displeased with himself when he has been very severe towards his
children.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, perceive what is meant by the reason
here given, that the Jews were not to fear if they dwelt in the land, because
God had sufficiently chastised them, and that he was so pacified that he would
not further pursue them with severity. Jeremiah at the same time reminds us,
that whatever evils happen to us, they ought to be ascribed to God&#8217;s
judgment, and not to adverse fortune. <i>We </i>hence see that by these words
the people were exhorted to repent; for as <i>they </i>were bidden to entertain
good hope, because their safety was in God&#8217;s hand, so also the Prophet
shews that as to the time past <i>they </i>had suffered nothing by chance, but
that they had been punished because they had provoked God&#8217;s wrath. It

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet obviates the doubt which might have
grieved or agitated the minds of the people. They ought, indeed, to have
recumbed on God&#8217;s promise alone; but it was difficult to be without doubts
in a state of things so uncertain and confused; for the king of Babylon, as it
has been stated, was grievously offended when the governor of the land was
slain. The king had received wrong from the people, and the heat of war since
the late victory had not cooled. They then justly feared, being conscious of the
evil that had been done; and then they had to do with a proud and cruel enemy.
God therefore removed from them this doubt; and thus he confirmed the paternal
care which he had shewn towards them by kindly freeing them from every fear, and
taking away every ground of terror.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though Nebuchadnezzar had been offended, and might
avenge the wrong done to him, yet God promised to prevent this, and declared
that he would not suffer him to do any evil to the Jews. &#8220;Ye fear,&#8221;
he says, &#8220;Nebuchadnezzar, but cease to do so; let this fear be dismissed,
for he will not hurt you.&#8221; And the reason is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because I am with you to save
you, and to deliver you from his hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Here he bade the Jews to entertain good hope, because, while relying on his
protection they would be safe: for there is no more any reason for doubting,
when God declares that he will stand on our side. For if he is ours, we may be
confident, as David was, when he said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I will not fear
what man may do to me; for thou,
God,&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">he says, &#8220;art
with me;&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and also,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I will not fear

side.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;192304&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
23:4;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;192703&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
27:3)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We ought then to feel wholly assured, that the help
of God is above that of all creatures. Thus were the whole world to rise up
against us, we might as from a secure and safe place look down with indifference
on all attempts, forces, and preparations. This is then the sum of what is here
said; and it is according to what Christ says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;My Father, who has
given you to <i>me, </i>is greater than
all.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431029&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John

<div><font face="Palatino">Had there then been a grain of faith in the Jews,
they would have laid hold on this promise; and then had they tenaciously held
it, as though it were a plank in a shipwreck, it would have led them safe to the
harbor. It ought then to be sufficient to shake off all cares, to drive away all
fears, and to put to flight every diffidence, when God promises to stand on our
side. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
am</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with you to save
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and he adds, to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>deliver
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He expresses the way and manner of
saving them; for they might still have objected and said, &#8220;What will be
this salvation? for Nebuchadnezzar is like a furious lion; how then can we be
saved, since we cannot think otherwise than that he will be enraged against
us?&#8221; To this God answers, by pointing out the manner, for he would
<i>deliver </i>them from his hand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms the same thing in other words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will shew mercies to
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some explain this as meaning, that
God would be merciful towards them; and I allow that this is the first reason
why they ought to have entertained hope; but I doubt not but that the Prophet
refers here to Nebuchadnezzar, as though he had said, &#8220;I will turn the
heart of the king of Babylon to mercy, so that he will deal mercifully with
you.&#8221; For God is said to shew mercies, when he forgives, and when he
reconciles those who have sinned to himself; but he is said also to shew
mercies, when he inclines the hearts of men to mercy. For this reason Jacob
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;God will shew you
mercies before the
man.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;014314&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
43:14)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But I abstain from other proofs on a point which
ought to be well known.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sum of what is said then is, that Nebuchadnezzar
would be humane and merciful towards the Jews, because it was in God&#8217;s
power to change his heart. For we know that God turns as he pleases the hearts
of men; and he often changes wolves into sheep. The meaning then is, that though
Nebuchadnezzar boiled with hatred towards the people, and was prepared wholly to
destroy the remnant, there yet would be a remedy in God&#8217;s hand, for he
could soften his hardness, pacify his wrath, and from a savage wild beast make
him a father, merciful, as it were, towards his children.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this passage teaches us, that the hearts and
purposes of men are governed by a power from above, so that enemies, even the
worst, while they rage against us, are moved not only by their own feelings, but
also by the hidden working of God, and according to his counsel, as he would
have them thus to try our faith. For if God moderates those who boil with anger
and wrath, and renders them placable to us; so also he lets loose the reins to
those who rage against us, and not only so, but he also stirs them up, when his
purpose is to punish us for our sins, according to the doctrine taught us
everywhere in Scripture. So in Psalm 106, it is said that God turned the hearts
of the heathens to hate his people. But here, on the other hand, God promises,
that Nebuchadnezzar would be kind and humane, so as to spare the Jews, because
he would control his heart, and shew them mercy by inclining the king to forgive
the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This then ought to be carefully noticed; for when we
see ourselves surrounded on every side by the ungodly whom Satan drives to
madness, so that they seek no other thing than to tread us under their feet,
especially when they have the power to destroy us, except we feel fully assured,
that their hearts, feelings, and all their thoughts are in God&#8217;s hands, we
must necessarily be wholly disheartened. Hence to mitigate all our fears, it
avails us much to hear that men&#8217;s hearts are turned and ruled according to
the will of God. It now follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">God having promised, that the counsel he gave to the
Jews would be good and safe, now, on the other hand, threatens them, that if
they disobeyed, everything they would attempt would end miserably. They had not
expressly asked whether it would be for their good to go into Egypt, or whether
it would be pleasing to God; but God, who penetrates into all hidden purposes,
anticipated them, and declared that their going would be unhappy, if they fled
into Egypt. We hence see how the Prophet, or rather God himself, who spoke by
his servant, tried by all means to keep them in the way of
duty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If ye say, We shall not dwell in
this land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it shall be ill with you, he
says: but before he denounced punishment, he shewed that they deserved to be
destroyed, if they went to Egypt; for had the thing been in itself lawful, yet
to attempt such a thing against the express will of God was, as we know, an
impious and a diabolical presumption and rashness. God had forbidden them
specifically in his Law ever to set their hearts on Egypt,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;051716&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
17:16;) and he had often confirmed the same thing by his Prophets,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;233002&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
30:2;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;233101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
31:1;) and now again he seals the former prophecies, as he expressly forbids
them to go to Egypt. The Prophet then sets this crime before their eyes:
&#8220;If ye flee into Egypt, what is it that compels you? even because ye will
not obey God.&#8221; There is then great weight in these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nor obey the voice of Jehovah
your God</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>as though he had said, that
they could not think of Egypt, except they designedly, as it were, rejected the
authority of God, and resisted his counsel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Saying, No; for we will go into
the land of Egypt, where we shall not see
war</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. here the Prophet discovers the
very fountain of rebellion, namely, that they paid no regard to God&#8217;s
favor. They were indeed exposed to many dangers in their own land, which
produced fear and trembling, and its desolation also might have filled them with
horror and weariness; but as God had declared that their safety would be cared
for by him, how great and how base an ingratitude it was to deem as nothing that
aid which he had freely promised! The Prophet then, in condemning their
disobedience, shews at the same time the cause of it, even that unbelief led
them away from rendering obedience to God. <i>If</i>, then, <i>ye say, </i>No,
&#8212; this word was a proof of their obstinacy; but he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We shall
go</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>into Egypt,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>where we shall not see war, where
we shall not hear the sound of the trumpet,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>as though, indeed, the promise of God were false or void. But the Prophet
here discovers their hidden impiety, that they did not recumb on God&#8217;s
promise. They promised then to themselves a peaceable life in Egypt. Was it in
their power to effect this? and God, what could he do? he had <i>declared
</i>that they would be safe and secure in the land of Canaan. It was to charge
God with falsehood, to hope for rest in Egypt, and to imagine nothing but
disturbances in the land where God bade them to remain in
quietness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then see why he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We shall go into Egypt, where we
shall not see war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor hunger for
bread</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>They promised to themselves an
abundance of all blessings, for the land of Egypt was fruitful. But could not
God afflict them with want? The Egyptians, we know, had also been sometimes
visited with famine. We hence see why God so much condemned the design of the
people as to their going into Egypt; for they entertained vain hopes, and at the
same time charged God indirectly with falsehood.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear the word of Jehovah, ye
remnant of Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Jeremiah, by thus
addressing them, no doubt endeavored to lead them to obedience. We indeed know
that men in prosperity are in a manner inebriated, so that they are not easily
induced to obey sound counsels. For whence comes it that kings and princes of
the world indulge themselves so much, and allow such license to their lusts?
even because the splendor of their fortune inebriates them. So also private men,
when all things succeed according to their wishes, they lodge in their own
dregs; hence it is that they are difficult to be ruled. The Prophet, on the
other hand, shews that there is no reason for them to be proud. <i>Ye are,
</i>he says, a small number, and God has wonderfully saved you.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye remnant of
Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In short, they are reminded of
their humble and miserable condition, that they might be more teachable. But
this also was done without any fruit, as we shall hereafter
see.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This saith Jehovah of hosts, the
God of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Of these words we have
spoken elsewhere. God is often called the God of hosts on account of his power:
so by this term God sets forth his own greatness. Afterwards when he is said to
be the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>we know that the benefit of
adoption was thus brought to the recollection of the people; for God had them
especially as his people, and bound them as it were to himself. This ought then
to have been a most holy bond of faithfulness and obedience. It was not, then,
by way of honor that the Prophet thus spoke, but in order to reprove the
Israelites for their hardness and ingratitude towards God. If, he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye set your faces to go into
Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
and ye enter in there to sojourn, it shall be that the sword which ye fear shall
meet you,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>etc. Here is their punishment
described, and there is nothing obscure in the words. God shows that they were
greatly deceived, if they thought that they would be prosperous in Egypt; for no
prosperity can be hoped except through the favor and blessing of God; and God
pronounced a curse on all their perverse counsels when he saw that they would
not be restrained by his word. If, then, we attempt anything contrary to the
prohibition of God, it must necessarily end unsuccessfully; and why? because the
cause of all prosperity is the favor of <i>God, </i>and so his curse always
renders all issues sad and unhappy: and however prosperous at first may be what
we undertake against God&#8217;s will, yet the end will be wretched and
miserable, according to what the Prophet teaches here.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet confirms what he had already said, by an
example of God&#8217;s vengeance, which had lately been shewn as to the Jews;
for though the destruction of the city and the Temple had been often predicted
to them, they yet had become torpid as to God&#8217;s threatenings. God,
however, after having delayed for a long time, at length executed what he had
threatened. They had titan seen that dreadful example, which ought to have
filled them, and also their posterity, with fear. Then the Prophet, as he saw
that they were so tardy and stupid that they thoughtlessly derided God&#8217;s
threat-enings, reminded them of what they had lately seen. &#8220;Ye
know,&#8221; he says, &#8220;how God&#8217;s fury had been poured forth on the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, such also will be poured forth on those who will flee
into <i>Egypt.&#8221;</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now Jeremiah was able to speak with authority, as he
had been the herald of that vengeance now mentioned. If any other had declared
in God&#8217;s name what had happened, they might have objected and said, that
they had indeed been justly punished by God, but that it did not hence follow
flint what he said was true; but as the Prophet had for forty years often and
constantly denounced on them what at length they had really and by experience
found to have been predicted to them from above, he was able to repeat a similar
judgment of God with the highest authority, as he now does.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as my fury was poured

either from water or from metals: hence some give this rendering, &#8220;As my
fury flowed down;&#8221; but the verb used by Jeremiah means proper]y to pour
forth. It may, however, as I have said, be applied to water, which spreads when
poured out, or to metals, which being liquid spread here and there. He then
means, that all who should go to Egypt would be wretched and miserable; for
wheresoever they might try to withdraw themselves, the vengeance of God would
yet find them though exiles, for it would spread like a deluge over all the
inhabitants, so that they would in vain seek hiding-places. We now see the
design of the Prophet. The meaning is, that as the Jews had by their calamity
known him to have been a true and faithful servant of God in foretelling the
destruction of the city and Temple, so would they find now, except they
repented, that the message by which he threatened a second destruction, had come
also from God. <i>-</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Poured

understood as an execration. He then says that they would be an <i>execration,
</i>that is, a formula of execration, as we have elsewhere explained. Whosoever
then had a wish to express a curse, they would, as the Prophet says, use this
form as a common proverb, <i>&#8220;May </i>God curse thee as he did the
Jews,&#8221; &#8212; &#8220; May I perish as the Jews perished.&#8221; In short,
he intimates that the punishment would be so horrible that men would turn it to
a common proverb, he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And an
astonishment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, that God&#8217;s
vengeance would be so dreadful, that all would be filled with amazement. He
further adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And a curse and a
reproach</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The sum of what is said is,
that God would inflict on the Jews not a common punishment, but such as would be
remembered among all the heathens, in order that it might appear that their
wickedness in obstinately rejecting the prophetic word was not
light.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He lastly adds that they should <i>never see
</i>their own land; for it was not the design of the Jews to dwell perpetually
in Egypt; for they pretended that they remained firm and constant in their
dependence on God&#8217;s promise, and boasted that they had a hope of a return,
because God had fixed seventy years for their exile. As they then thus foolishly
gloried, that they hoped in God for the promised favor, he says that they were
shut out as to any hope of a return; for though God would restore the other
captives dispersed throughout the East, yet the Egyptian guests were doomed to
die in their exile. This then was to cut off from them every hope, in order that
they might know that they were wholly rejected, and would have a place no more
among- God&#8217;s people, however they might wish to be deemed the first. It

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet explains more fully their sin; for
their punishment might have appeared extreme, had not their impiety been more
clearly unfolded. He then says that this punishment ought not to be regarded as
too rigid, because God had not once only protested against the Jews and
admonished them in a solemn manner and before witnesses; but they to the last
not, only despised his counsel and warnings, but proudly rejected them. And he
adds, that they <i>dealt falsely and perfidiously </i>with God, because they
pretended that they would be obedient as soon as the will of God was known; but
they shewed that in reality they had no such purpose; for their own vanity and
deceit took full possession of them when the Prophet answered them in
God&#8217;s name; nor had they a desire to obey God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now consider the words:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah hath spoken against you,
the remnant of Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He again calls
them a <i>remnant, </i>in order that they might remember that they had no reason
any more to be proud. We know how the Jews while in prosperity disregarded the
Prophets; for they were inebriated with their good fortune. But God had
dissipated this pride, with which they were previously filled. The Prophet had
also set before them the favor through which they had been liberated, that they
might learn hereafter to submit to God and his word. For this reason then he
called them a remnant, even to render them more attentive and teachable. But it
was done without any benefit; for though their affairs were nearly hopeless, and
they were reduced almost to nothing, yet they had not laid aside their high
spirits. They were then still swollen with false confidence. But this warning,
however, availed to render them more inexcusable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If ye enter into
Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>knowing know
ye</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, <i>knowing ye shall know.
</i>The verb is in the future tense, though it may be taken as an imperative.
But the future tense is the most suitable, <i>knowing ye shall know, </i>that
is, the event itself will teach you, but too late, as the foolish are never wise
till after the evil has taken place.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Knowing ye shall know that I have
protested against you this day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God says
that he had left nothing undone to bring the Jews to a right mind; for a protest
is usually made in a solemn manner, witnesses being called in, so that no one
can plead that. he has gone astray through ignorance. To take away then every
ground of excuse, witnesses were wont to be called. Hence God speaks according
to the common practice and in a forensic sense, and says that he had
<i>protested </i>against the Jews, lest they should by chance offend through
want of knowledge. It then follows, that they knowingly perished, as though they
had sought their own destruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">he now adds another circumstance, that they had sent
him under the pretense of rare piety, as though they were in every way ready to
render obedience to God. But he first says that they had <i>deceived
</i>themselves, or had been deceived. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h[t</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>toe, </i>from which the <i>Hithpael </i>comes, means to err or go astray. But
interpreters do not agree; for some give this explanation, that they deceived
the Prophet in their hearts, that is, that they craftily retained their perverse
design of going to Egypt, and at the same time professed that they were ready to
obey. But as the Prophet&#8217;s name is not mentioned here, this explanation
seems unnatural. I therefore prefer the other explanation, that they deceived
themselves; and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>beth, </i>is here redundant, as in many places:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye
deceived</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>then, <i>your
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>own souls, when ye sent
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Prophet intimates that when
they sought to act craftily they were deceived; for God is wont to discover the
astute, and when they devise this or that, they only weave snares and toils for
themselves; and we see that craftiness ever brings the ungodly to ruin. The
Prophet, according to this sense, derides that perverse affectation of
astuteness, when the ungodly seek to deceive God; and he says that they deceived
themselves, as we see also daily. Then he says that they themselves had been the
authors of the evil, for they had brought themselves to ruin by their astute and
crafty counsel, when they <i>sent </i>him to Jehovah. The
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When ye sent me to Jehovah your
God, saying, Pray for us.
</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fG20</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He reproves them not only for perfidy, but also for
sacrilege, because they wickedly profaned the name of God. For it. was not to be
endured that they should pretend a regard for religion, and testify that they
would be obedient to God, and should at the same time cherish in their hearts
that perverse intention which afterwards they discovered. And hence he not only
relates that he had been sent, but that he had also been solicited to
<i>intercede </i>for them. It was then a twofold sacrilege, for they had asked
what would please God, and afterwards disregarded the prophecy, &#8212; and then
they offered a prayer, and when God gave them an answer by his servant., they
counted it as nothing! We now perceive why Jeremiah so expressly mentioned these
two things.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pray for us to our God, and
according to all which Jehovah our God shall
say</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, relate thou to us</i>: the people
<i>seemed </i>to act with wonderful sincerity; they exhorted the Prophet to
dissemble nothing, to add nothing and to diminish nothing&#8217;. What better
can be wished than that men should lay aside all ambiguity and all evasions, and
not wish God&#8217;s words to be corrupted? And this the Jews expressed in high
terms, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whatever Jehovah our God
shall answer, declare thou to us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here
they seemed to have more zeal than Jeremiah himself; for they enjoined a law,
that he should add nothing and diminish nothing, but that he should be a
faithful interpreter of God&#8217;s will. They seemed then to be half-angels.
They afterwards testified that they would <i>do whatever </i>God should
<i>command </i>them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He at length adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I have this day declared it
to you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here he sets forth his own
fidelity, not for the sake of boasting, but that their impiety might be
reproved, who at length despised the oracle of God, which they had boasted that
they would obey. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have not

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and according to all the
things on account of which he hath sent me to you.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet again confirms the truth, that it
was their own fault that the Jews did not follow what was right, and also what
was for their good, for he had faithfully delivered to them what God had
commanded. He now adds, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet at length concludes his discourse, after
having mentioned the reasons why God would deal so severely with them, even
because their perfidy, impiety, ingratitude, and obstinate contempt were
unsufferable. After having then shewn that they had no reason to expostulate as
though God were extremely rigid, he at length declares what end awaited them,
even that they should </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>die by the
sword, famine, or pestilence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is,
that there would be no hope of safety to them, because if they escaped from the
sword, they should be beset with famine, and if they evaded the famine, they
should be destroyed by pestilence. It is a common mode of speaking with the
Prophets, as it is well known, that when they intimate that the ungodly in vain
hope for impunity, they represent God as having at his command all kinds of
punishment.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet proceeds with the remaining part of
the narrative. He says that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whole
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>obstinately persevered in their
wicked design, so that he effected nothing by his warning and protest. Now this
stupidity of the people was monstrous; for they had found out by experience the
fidelity of the Prophet for many years; and further, they had gone to him
because they believed that he was a faithful and an approved servant of God. He
had not merely answered them in God&#8217;s name, but as he knew their hardness,
he added protestations which might have moved even stones. But he addressed the
deaf; and it hence appears that they were wholly fascinated by the devil. And
thus let us learn not to mock God, nor bring a double heart when we inquire as
to his will, but to suffer ourselves to be ruled by his word.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now he says, that when he had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>finished speaking to the whole
people, as God had commanded, then John the son of Kareah, and Azariah the son
of Hoshaiah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>being the first among them,
spoke against him. As to Azariah, we cannot know with any certainty what he was.
But we have here in John the son of Kareah an example deserving of notice. We
have seen that he was a bold, wise, and prudent man, and also of an upright
mind. In short, when we consider what the Prophet has before said of him, we
cannot but think he was by nature a heroic man; nay, when he is compared with
Gedaliah, who, at the same time, was an excellent man, and whom the Prophet has
adorned with high commendations, he yet far excelled him. Gedaliah, indeed, had
a kind disposition, he was courageous in protecting the people, he was a man of
integrity; and, besides, he was a father to the people, and so conducted himself
when things were in a hopeless state, that, beyond the expectation of all, he
gathered together the remnant of the people; and we have also seen that by his
efforts the Prophet had been delivered from instant death. But John the son of
Kareah had been a remarkable helper to him, having come to him of his own
accord, and offered to him his assistance; and further, he faithfully and
prudently warned him to beware of the perfidy of that unprincipled man, by whom
he was afterwards killed. Gedaliah fell through extreme credulity. John, then,
the son of Kareah, had a greater appearance of excellency than Gedaliah had
exhibited. But what does the Spirit of God now declare respecting him and his
associates? They are said to have been proud and obstinate. We hence see that
some men excel in greatness of mind, and are yet of a refractory disposition;
and this is for the most part the case during&#8217; a disturbed state of
things. For some come forth wonderfully courageous; but when things do not fall
in with their wishes, they become ferocious and rebel against God and men, and
besides, they will never bear to be brought under submission. Such, then, was
John the son of Kareah: at one time he manifested extraordinary virtue, but at
length it appeared what he really was.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, with the authority of a judge, declares
that he and his associates were <i>proud</i>:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>then Azariah the son of Hoshaiah,
and John the son of Kareah, and all the proud
men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>said, <i>A falsehood dost thou
speak. </i>This was extremely insolent and reproachful; for they had lately
testified that they regarded Jeremiah as God&#8217;s faithful servant, and that
they would receive whatever he might bring as God&#8217;s true oracle; but now
they charge him with falsehood! how great was this presumption! But it hence
appears how deep and various, and how tortuous are the recesses which are in the
hearts of men; for at one time they announce honied words, and afterwards they
utter nothing&#8217; but virulence. So from the same mouth, as it were, almost
in the same moment, comes forth what is sweet; and what is
bitter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us hence learn that the heart of man is full of
every kind of deceit, until it be cleansed by the Spirit of God. We also see,
when once impiety boils up, to what extremes it will
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>proceed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>for these men were not only insolent and reproachful towards
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jeremiah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>but also towards God himself. And they did not now make evasions as before,
nor did they raise objections; but they openly raved against the Prophet. Thus
hypocrisy has indeed for a time its coverings, but when the ungodly are urged by
God, then they observe no bounds:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou speakest what is
false</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They afterwards throw the blame on Baruch, who had
been the Prophet&#8217;s faithful servant. As they could not find out any reason
why Jeremiah should speak falsely, they turned their fury against Baruch. They
did not then spare Jeremiah for honor&#8217;s sake, but as they had no reason
whatever to speak evil of him, they fixed the blame on Baruch, who yet was as
innocent as Jeremiah. <i>Baruch, </i>they said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>excites thee against
us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Had Jeremiah so prophesied through
the influence of another, yet his crime might have been at ]east extenuated. Now
they said that he was mendacious, and brought forth nothing but impositions; but
the ungodly do not regard what they say, for the devil drives them on headlong.
And they charged Baruch with a very groat crime, that he wished to betray them
to the Chaldeans, and then to expose them to slaughter, and to deliver them that
they might be driven into exile. All this would have been the greatest cruelty.:
But then if we consider what sort of man Baruch had been, and how innocently he
had conducted himself, how he had endangered his life in defending the true
worship of God and prophetic doctrine, there was surely no reason for loading
him with so great a reproach.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we see that God&#8217;s servants have been always
exposed to extreme reproaches, even when they have exhibited the greatest
integrity. If then, at this day, we hear of evil reports, after having labored
to act uprightly, it ought not to appear to us a hard or a new thing to bear
them with patience. We must, indeed, do what we can to stop the mouths of the
malevolent and the wicked; nor ought we to give occasion, as Paul admonishes us,
to the malignant. But when we have done our duty faithfully, if yet dogs bark at
us, if we be loaded with many reproaches and crimes, let us learn patiently to
endure them. This, then, ought to be done by us, since we see that Baruch was
accused of extreme perfidy and cruelty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What now had Baruch to do with the Chaldeans? Had he
fled to them? Was he anxious to gain influence for himself? or to procure favor
for himself? There was no such thing; he always followed Jeremiah wherever he
went. Jeremiah had indeed obtained some favor; but this was to be attributed to
the gratuitous kindness of God. Baruch, then, had got leave from the Chaldeans
to remain with the Prophet; for the condition of both was the same. But yet he
had not followed the Chaldeans, when his option was given to him. For when the
Chaldeans offered quietness and rest to Jeremiah, Baruch might have also gone to
that fertile country; but he chose to remain in the land. We hence see that he
had removed from himself every suspicion, and yet he could not stop the mouths
of the malevolent, but they slandered and. calumniated him. Let us then know
that God&#8217;s servants prove their firmness and constancy, when they are
assailed on every side by the calumnies of men, and yet are satisfied with the
testimony of their own conscience, and go on in their course, and look forward
to the judgment of God, and care not what men think or speak, provided God
approves of them, and is their judge in heaven.</font><br></div>

will of God was; for when they saw that God&#8217;s counsel did not harmonize

now more clearly condemns their obstinacy in not obeying God; and it is said
emphatically, that they did not obey the voice of God, because they denied that
God had spoken. Though then they sought to evade, Jeremiah on the other hand
declares, that he was a true interpreter of God&#8217;s will, that he had
announced nothing but what had come from God. He then brings them all in as
guilty, the leaders and the whole people, that no man might think it strange

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now gives us a narrative of what he had
briefly touched upon. He then says that John and the rest of the leaders took
the remnant of the people, who were there alive, and those who had returned from
various countries; for many had become fugitives among the Moabites and the
Idumeans, when they saw the city surrounded by the forces of King
Nebuchadnezzar. Then they fled here and there, as it usually happens, and waited
for the issue of the war. But after Nebuchadnezzar had departed, and a
permission had been given to Gedaliah to collect what remained of the people and
to place them in cities and towns, many returned into the land, now desolate;
for they had dwelt with aliens, and had been miserably treated. As then they
could not settle out of their own land nor find any quiet habitation, they
returned, as it is usual with men reduced to want, who have no settled dwelling.
They then returned, that they might live under the protection of
Gedaliah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now the Prophet says, that they were taken by <i>John
</i>and brought into.<i> Egypt. </i>This then was the way in which they shewed
their obstinacy. We hence see how audacious must these leaders have been, that
they hesitated not to go into Egypt, though it was shewn to be a fatal step.
There was not indeed at that time any army of Nebuchadnezzar in Judea, though
his vengeance might have been dreaded. And then, having fled to: Egypt, they
might have been ill-treated there, and not hospitably received.: But we hence
<i>perceive, </i>that when men once shake off the yoke of God, they are hurried
on by a diabolical madness, so that there is nothing insurmountable to them. Had
they been asked whether they acted rightly, they might have raised a thousand
arguments as excuses; but when they followed their own propensity, they in a
manner, so to speak, leaped over the clouds. Impiety then is always full of
rashness and audacity. But as we see that the ungodly thus rush headlong into
ruin, even when God pronounces a curse on their counsels and proceedings, let us
learn to take encouragement ever to obey God; for he promises a joyful and
blessed issue at all times when we follow the ways pointed out by him.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>John</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>then and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the other leaders of
the forces took the remnant of the
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And then he shews how little those exiles consulted
their own good, who had returned to dwell in the land of Judea; for they might
have still rested in safety among the nations who had in kindness received them;
but in Egypt God soon executed his judgments on the natives as well as on
strangers. But they deserved such a reward, because they preferred to obey the
command of the perverse and obstinate, rather than to obey the voice of God
speaking by his Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet also mentions particularly who they were;
they were men and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>women and
children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some render the last word
&#8220;puberty,&#8221; which I do not approve, since Scripture speaks thus of
children. Then John and his associates took <i>childhood, </i>or children; and
he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the daughters of the
king</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We have before inquired who these
daughters of the king were: the probability is that they were his daughters by
his concubines; and that they had been put in some safe place, so that if any
great evil happened, they might not fall into the hands of enemies. Then these
daughters of the king had returned with the other exiles, but were afterwards
carried into Egypt.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At last he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all the souls
which</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>had been left by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nebuzaradan with Gedaliah, with
Jeremiah, and with Baruch</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This had not
been expressed elsewhere, that is, that Jeremiah and Baruch were joined with
Gedaliah as rulers over the remnant of the people. But it was not the design of
Jeremiah to relate everything that then took place. Now then, when an occasion
occurred, he says that he and also Baruch were made governors in connection with
Gedaliah. He then adds, that they all
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>came into
Egypt,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or that they entered into Egypt,.
For the word first used,

one of the chief cities of Egypt; but its name has perished together with is
wealth; for in heathen writers hardly the name of this city is found. They
indeed mention the city Taphnim, but speak not of Taphnees. It is then probable,
as changes take place in a country, that this city became by degrees forsaken,
so as to become obscure and mean, and that other cities were built which
exceeded it in wealth. He then says that they

<div><font face="Palatino">This passage shews that the Prophet was by force
drawn away with others, so that he became an exile in Egypt contrary to his own
wishes; for he did not go there of his own accord, inasmuch as we have seen how
strictly he forbade them all to go down to Egypt. he was, however, compelled to
go there, as though he had been bound with chains. He did not then go there
designedly, nor did he through despair follow those miserable men; for he would
have preferred to die a hundred times through famine and want in the land of
Judah rather than to have sought in this way the lengthening of his life. It
then appears that he was driven there as it were by enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as nothing happens except through God&#8217;s
purpose, so from this prophecy it appears that God ordered the going down of his
servant, and that he was not so subjected to the will of the wicked, but that he
was always guided by the hidden influence of God; for it was God&#8217;s will to
have his herald even in the midst of Egypt, that he might declare to the Jews
what, was to be. His doctrine, indeed, was not of any benefit to them; but it
was God&#8217;s purpose to drive them as it were into madness, inasmuch as their
wickedness was wholly irreclaimable; for it is a harder thing for the wicked to
hear God&#8217;s voice when he threatens vengeance, than to feel his hand. When,
therefore, the unbelieving avoid the word of God, they are still constrained,
willing or unwilling, to hear what they willfully reject, even that God will be
their judge. The Prophet then was sent, according to the hidden purpose of God,
into Egypt, that he might there perform his wonted vocation and proceed in the
discharge of his office, and there carry on his prophetic work.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this prophecy was greatly disliked; for as the
Jews had been already much exasperated, this threatening was still more
calculated to kindle up their fury; and Jeremiah did also create danger to
himself from the Egyptians, for he not only threatened the Jews, but also the
whole kingdom of Egypt. We hence perceive how invincible was his courage, for he
marched through certain deaths, and was yet terrified by no dangers, but
performed the office entrusted to him by God. Some think that he was on this
account stoned by the Jews; but this is not probable, nay, it may be gathered
from other places that he died a natural death. However this may have been, his
perseverance and firmness were wonderful, for he struggled to the end, and
without weariness, with those wild beasts, whose savageness he had more than
enough experienced.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now see what this prophecy is:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The word of Jehovah came to
Jeremiah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and the sum of it is, that the
Prophet was bidden not only to proclaim the vengeance of God, but also to
confirm it by a visible symbol, as it was necessary to arouse unbelieving men.
For so great was their stupidity, that unless God roused all their senses, they
would have never attended; they were deaf. Then the Lord set before their eyes
what they were unwilling and refused to hear. For this reason the Prophet was
bidden to add an outward sign to his prophecy; according to what we have stated
in other places, signs were often connected with the doctrine on account of the
tardiness, or rather the stupidity of men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He was then commanded to take
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>great
stones</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and to <i>hide </i>them in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
clay</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or cement,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in a
brick-kiln</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, in a kiln where
bricks were burnt, or in a place where they were usually made, or where
materials were taken to form them. And this place was not far from the palace of
the king in the city of Taphnees, as the Prophet expressly declares; nay, he
says that it was nigh the gate. As, then, this place was near the palace, the
Prophet was bidden to hide there the stones, and in the sight of the Jews. This
was the symbol. Now, it is shewn for what end God would have the stones to be
fixed in the clay or cement; for if the stones were only rolled there with great
labor by the Prophet, there would have been no instruction; and all signs we
know are unmeaning and without any importance without the word. It is
God&#8217;s word, then, that in a manner gives life to signs, and applies them
for the benefit and instruction of men. Therefore God&#8217;s command is added,
that he was to speak to the Jews:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt say to them, Thus
saith Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He brings in God as the
speaker, that the threatening might be more effectual, as it has been stated
elsewhere; for if he had only related the words of God, he could not have thus
arrested their attention, which was very tardy. This, then, is the reason why he
speaks in the person of God himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold,
I</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, &#8212; the </i>particle demonstrative
and the pronoun are both emphatical,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ynnh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>enni; </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I
send</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says, <i>to bring
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nebuchadnezzar, the king of
Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne on these
stones</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We now understand the drift of
the whole, even that these stones were thrown into the <i>cement, </i>that God
might build up a throne for Nebuchadnezzar. The time, indeed, for building the
throne had not yet <i>come; </i>but God&#8217;s purpose was to lay the
foundations, so that they might be hid until the time arrived. The Prophet,
then, built a throne for Nebuchadnezzar, when he cast; these stones into the
place of the brick-kiln.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must now examine each particular in order. God
says that he would send to bring Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. This
mission must not be understood otherwise than that of the secret providence of
God; for he had no attendants by whom he might send for Nebuchadnezzar, but he
called him, as it were, by his nod only. Moreover, this mode of speaking is
borrowed, taken from men, who, when they wish anything to be done, intimate what
their object is; and then, when they give orders, they issue their commands.
This is what earthly kings do, because they can by a nod only accomplish
whatever comes to their minds. But God, who needs no external aids, is said to
send when he executes his own purpose, and that by his incomprehensible power.
And further, God intimates that when Nebuchadnezzar came, it would by no means
be by chance, but to take vengeance on the perverse Jews, who hoped for a safe
retirement in Egypt, when yet God promised them a quiet habitation in the land
of Judah, had they remained there. Then God declares that he would be the leader
of that march when Nebuchadnezzar came into Egypt, as though he had said that
the war would be carried on under his banner. Nebuchadnezzar did not from design
render obedience to God; for ambition and pride led him to Egypt when he came,
and for this reason, because the Egyptians had so often provoked him, so that
without dishonor to himself he could no longer defer vengeance. It was, then,
for this reason he came, if we look to his object. But God declares that he
overruled the king as well as all the Babylonians, so that he would arm them
when he pleased, and bring them into Egypt, and by their means carry on war with
the Egyptians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For the same reason he calls him <i>his servant;
</i>not that Nebuchadnezzar was worthy of so honorable a name, for he had
nothing less, as we have said, than a design to serve God; but he is called
God&#8217;s servant, because he executed what God himself had decreed: for the
Scripture sometimes calls even the devils the servants of God; but in strict
language, angels and the faithful are alone his servants. Kings and prophets are
also, for a special reason, called God&#8217;s servants, to whom is committed
the authority to rule or to teach. But in this place, as in many other places,
the Scripture calls those God&#8217;s servants whom he employs to effect his
purpose, even when they themselves have no such design. But the Prophet, no
doubt, had also in view the Jews, so that they might know that this war was
approved by God; for Nebuchadnezzar would not have come except he had been
brought there by God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It then follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and I will set his
throne</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This, also, is what God claims
for himself, even the erecting of the throne of the King Nebuchadnezzar before
the palace of the king of Egypt. The king of Babylon, doubtless, thought that
the war was carried on through his own efforts and valor, and the courage of his
soldiers; moreover, he sacrificed to his own fortune, as heathens use to do; and
hence it is said in Isaiah of the Assyrian,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;He will not think
so.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;231007&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
10:7)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But God designed this to be declared to the Jews
before the time, that they might then know that the just reward of their
obstinacy would be rendered to them, for they were to be taught, as we have
said, for their good and benefit. But as they were already inexcusable, it was
God&#8217;s purpose to shame them more and more, so that they might know that a
just punishment would be inflicted on them, because they had so obstinately
rejected all the counsel of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>I will, </i>then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>erect his throne on the stones
which I have hidden</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Prophet here
speaks irregularly, now in God&#8217;s name, then in his own; but this was not
done without reason. We have stated why he introduced God as the speaker, even
that he might make the Jews more attentive; for he knew that all his
threatenings would be derided except God&#8217;s majesty was set before them:
but now he connects himself with God, as though he had said that he had nothing
apart from God. This is the reason why he said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>upon the stones which I have
hid</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>God had not hidden the stones, but
the Prophet speaks, nevertheless, in the person of God. But, as I have already
said, this connection shews that the prophetic word is so connected with the
hand and power of God, that when the Prophet speaks, it ought to be counted the
same, as though God openly thundered from heaven. And this mode of speaking
ought to be carefully noticed, so that we may learn reverently to receive
whatever faithful teachers declare in his name, while performing the duties of
their office; for they are not to be looked upon as men, for otherwise whatever
proceeds from them may be disregarded; but we ought to receive the doctrine
proclaimed by their mouth as though God himself had descended from heaven to
speak to us.</font><br></div>

in the two following verses to the end of the chapter. As Egypt had cities well
fortified and deemed impregnable, the Jews never thought that the Chaldeans
could so easily penetrate into them. For, first, that country is situated in a
plain; and, secondly, in the midst of lakes: and it is in part surrounded by the
Nile and the Red Sea. As, then, Egypt was on every side so well fortified, they
thought that there would be there a quiet nest for them. But God declares that
King Nebuchadnezzar would become the conqueror of the whole land; and he removes
all <i>objections </i>when he says, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Those
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for death, to

&#8220;Were Egypt ever so populous, yet the immense multitude of men will avail
nothing, for they shall be conquered by their enemy; for some shall perish by
the sword, and some by various kinds of death, and some shall be driven into
exile; and Egypt shall be destroyed, as though no one stood up in its
defense.&#8221; We hence see that this was added, that the Prophet might shake
off the false confidence of the Jews. To the same purpose are the two following
verses.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He goes on with the same subject; and he ascribes to
God the kindling of the fire, that the Jews might know that the war would be
conducted by a divine power, and that Nebuchadnezzar would not come except
through God&#8217;s providence. For though, as it has been said, he had his own
reasons, yet God, by his wonderful power, led him, as it were, by the hand, to
punish the Egyptians. They, indeed, deserved such a destruction, because they
had by their fiat-teries deceived the miserable Jews, and had corrupted them.
Besides, their allurements had been very ruinous, for through them the aid of
God had been despised, and all the prophecies rejected. As then they had been
the authors of all kinds of evils to the Jews, we hence infer that they deserved
a dreadful vengeance; and this had been in due time made known to the Jews, but
they did not believe it. Then the Prophet fully confirms what had been declared
in his former prophecies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will kindle a
fire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says God,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the temples of the gods of
Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And he mentions temples, that the
Jews might understand that no part of the land would be safe or secure from
destruction: for it often happens that when the cruelty of enemies rages
greatly, the temples are spared; for religion commands respect, and honor has
been given also to idols, so that their temples have often remained untouched,
when enemies have wholly overthrown all other things. But it is probable, that
the Chaldeans had so great a presumption and pride, that they wished to destroy
all the temples, that there might be no religion anywhere except among
themselves. And some also among the Persians had this barbarity, as Xerxes, who,
when he entered into Greece, and some parts of Asia, burnt and destroyed all the
temples, and said also in derision, that all the gods in Greece were taken
captive, and were shut up in the temples, and that he accomplished everything
through his own valor. There is, indeed, no doubt but that Xerxes thus
arrogantly triumphed over the gods of the Greeks; and such was probably the
insolence displayed by the Chaldeans. However this may have been, yet God shews,
that no place in Egypt would be held sacred: for the Chaldeans would even burn
their temples. But at the same time he meant to cast a reproach on the obstinacy
of the Jews, because they went down to Egypt, whose safety depended on idols.
God then shews that they were more than blind, and wholly beside themselves, as
though they were brute animals, when they hoped for a quiet port in Egypt, which
was under the protection of false gods. God then says, that he would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>kindle a fire
</i></font><font face="Palatino">by which the temples of the gods of Egypt would
be burned.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he adds, <i>and it </i>or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he will burn
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This may be applied to the fire;
but he, no doubt, speaks of the King Nebuchadnezzar, for it immediately follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and shall carry them
captives</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall roll up the land of Egypt,
as a shepherd his garment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The verb
properly means to cover, but it means also sometimes to gather up. It may be
rendered here to roll up, as we say in French, <i>trousser et entortiller.
</i>He intimates, that Nebuchadnezzar would, according to his own will, so rule
in Egypt, that he would heap together all the wealth of the whole land: and as a
shepherd, when he leads his flock to another place, collects his utensils, and
rolls up his garments, or folds himself in them; so Nebuchadnezzar, says the
Prophet, would gather together, or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>roll up the whole land of
Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He mentions <i>land, </i>as
signifying the wealth which Nebuchadnezzar accumulated. At length he
adds</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, and thence shall he depart
in peace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He shews that the conquest
would be complete, for the Egyptians would not dare to mutter, nor dare to

<div><font face="Palatino">WE stated yesterday why Jeremiah spoke especially of
the temples of the gods, even that the Jews might understand that nothing would
escape destruction: for even the cruel-est enemies have usually withheld their
hands from the temples of gods. If sanctity and religion would not preserve the
temples, what then would become of private houses? He intimates, in short, that
such would be the ruin of Egypt, that no part would escape.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as Heliopolis was then in the greatest repute, he
says, that the <i>statues </i>of all the gods in that city would be broken, for
there the gods were especially worshipped. All heathen writers call it
Heliopolis, to which the Hebrew word corresponds; for Bethsemes means the city
of the sun; and Heliopolis means the same. As then this was the chief place
where the gods of Egypt were found, the Prophet, in order to shew that the ruin
of the whole land would be extreme, says that no temple would be there
inviolate. So also Isaiah says, when speaking of the ruin of
Egypt,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Behold, God will

<div><font face="Palatino">He spoke of God&#8217;s coming, because, under his
guidance it was, that Nebuchadnezzar led there his army, as it has been stated.
God did not, indeed, appear from heaven, but the army of Nebuchadnezzar was a
living representation of God&#8217;s power, when he punished the Egyptians. Now,
he says, that when God came there armed, and carried on a warlike expedition,
all the idols would be destroyed; for God would thus shew that the gods in whom
the Egyptians trusted were false, that they were mere fictions, which could give
no help when things came to an extremity. Now follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah had already prophesied against the Jews, who
had taken refuge in Egypt, as though there would be for them in that rich and
almost unassailable land a safe and quiet retreat. But he now speaks against
them for another reason, and denounces on them something more grievous than
before, even because they had not only gone into Egypt against God&#8217;s will,
but when they came there they polluted themselves with all kinds of
superstition. God, no doubt, designed, in due time, to prevent this, when he
forbade them to go into Egypt; for he knew how prone they were to idolatry, and
to false and adulterous modes of worship. He was therefore unwilling that they
should dwell in that land, where they might learn to pervert his worship. And
this had happened, as it appears from the present prophecy. As then they had
cast aside every shame, and given themselves up to the superstitions of the
heathens, the Prophet again testified, that God would take vengeance on them.
But we shall see that he had to do with refractory men; for without shewing any
respect for him, they attacked him with impetuous fury. The sum of what is said
then is, that the Jews who dwelt in Egypt were unworthy of any pardon, because
they had, as it were, designedly rejected the favor of God, and their obstinacy
had become altogether hopeless. We shall now consider the
words:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A word
</i></font><font face="Palatino">is said to have been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>given to Jeremiah to all the
Jews</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But God spoke to Jeremiah not in
the same way as to the Jews; for he committed to him the words which he
commanded him to deliver to others. Then the word was directly given to Jeremiah
only; but as Jeremiah was God&#8217;s interpreter to the people, the word is
said to be given in common to all, which yet at first, as it has been stated,
was committed to Jeremiah alone. For he did not favor the Jews with such an
honor as to speak to them, but he sent the Prophet as his messenger. He said
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the Jews who dwelt in
Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and afterwards he mentions
certain places, first <i>Migdol, </i>then <i>Tahpanhes, </i>and thirdly,
<i>Noph. </i>The first name some have rendered Magdal. That city was not so much
known at the time when Egypt flourished, but it has been mentioned by heathen
writers. Of Tahpanhes we spoke yesterday. Noph has been called Memphis; and it
is generally agreed that what the Hebrews called Noph was that noble and
celebrated city Memphis, which, as they suppose at this day, is called Cairo,
<i>Le Caire. </i>He lastly mentions the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>country of
Pathros</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which is supposed by some to
have been near Pelusia. But on such a matter as this I bestow no great labor;
for even heathen writers have regarded this as an obscure country, of no
importance. Pathros is elsewhere mentioned as a city, and some think it to have
been Petra of Arabia. But the Prophet no doubt refers here to the country in
which Memphis and other cities were situated, in which the Jews
dwelt.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he says these things for this reason, because a
question might have been raised, &#8220;As the Jews dwelt in Egypt, so large was
the land, that the Prophet could not have announced the commands of God to all.
This, then, was the reason why he intimates that. they were not dispersed
everywhere throughout Egypt, from one end to the other, but that they were in
one part only, and that they were so collected that his word might come to all.
This, then, was the reason why he mentioned the places where the Jews
sojourned.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now begins with reproof, because they were so
stupid as not to remember the vengeance which God had executed on themselves and
on the whole nation. They had been left alive for this end, that they might
acknowledge God&#8217;s judgment, and thus return to a right mind. Here, then,
the Prophet upbraids them with their insensibility, that they had profited
nothing under the scourges of God. They commonly say that fools, when they are
beaten, become wise. As then the Jews had not repented, after having been so
grievously chastised, it was a proof of extreme perverseness; for if the remnant
had a grain of a sound mind, they would have been humbled at least by the final
destruction of their nation, and when the city and the temple were demolished.
Since then they followed the same wicked courses, for which God had inflicted so
grievous a punishment, it was evident that they were wholly irreclaimable and
destitute of reason and judgment. This is the import of all the words of the
Prophet which we have read.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says first,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have seen what great evils I
brought </i></font><font face="Palatino">on you and the land. &#8220;Then ye
know that you have justly suffered all the evils which have happened to you; for
ye have not sinned through want of knowledge, but when I had sedulously warned
you by my Prophets, ye continued ever obstinate; ye have therefore fully
deserved such punishments. Now when God spared you, and wished that a small
number should remain, to preserve as it were a seed, how is it that these evils
which are still as it were before your eyes, are not remembered by you?&#8221;
We now then understand the design of the Prophet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be well to examine every part;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have
seen</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all the evil which I have brought
</i></font><font face="Palatino">(evil here means calamity) on
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jerusalem, and on all the cities
of Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and, behold, they are now <i>a
waste, and no one dwells there. </i>There is here an emphatical comparison
between Jerusalem and Memphis, between the cities of Judah and Heliopolis and
the whole country of Pathros. If then God had not. spared the holy city which he
had chosen, if he had not spared the cities of Judah which were under his
protection, how foolish it was for the Jews to think that they would be safe in
the cities of Egypt? By what privilege could these be secure, since the cities
of Judah had been reduced to a waste? We now then perceive why the Prophet
mentioned Jerusalem and the cities of Judah; it was, that he might expose the
stupidity of the Jews, because they thought, themselves safe in Egypt, a land
which God had ever held in abomination.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the evil which they did to
provoke</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>me. He refers to the sins by
which the Jews had provoked the wrath of God; for the people whom Jeremiah
addressed had relapsed into those superstitions which had been the cause of
their ruin. Had the Prophet spoken generally and said, that it was strange that
the Jews had forgotten the punishment which had been inflicted by God on the
whole nation, his doctrine would not have been so impressive. But when he now
points out as by the finger how they had procured for themselves such
calamities, he presses and urges them more forcibly to acknowledge their
madness, because they thus continually provoked God, and sinned not through
ignorance, but offended him by the same sins for which yet they had suffered
punishment so grievous and dreadful. This is the reason why the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the evil which they did to
provoke me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>even <i>to go, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to offer incense and to serve
alien gods.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>To go here intimates the
care and diligence they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>exercised</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>in false worship. God had shewn to the Jews a certain way in his Law which
they ought to have followed: had they then continued in the doctrine of the Law,
they would have kept in the right way, and gone forward to the right end. But
they are said to go, because they disregarded the Law and went here and there,
as those who wander at random, and know not where they are going. There is then
to be understood a contrast between <i>going </i>and remaining under the
teaching of the Law. To go, in short, is to weary one&#8217;s self by an erratic
course, when the word of God is neglected, and the way which it points out is
forsaken. This is one thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to offer incense and to serve
alien gods</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. In</i>cense here is mentioned as
a particular thing, then that which is general is added; for incense, as it is
well known, was an evidence of worship. Then the Prophet under one thing
condemns the idolatry of his own nation. But at length he shews that they were
given to other abominations, that they had devoted themselves to the false
worship of alien gods.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage, and those which are like it, are
entitled to particular notice; for we hence learn that men depart from God and
alienate themselves from the true worship of him, whenever they mingle with it
something of their own, and dream of this and that according to their own will,
the very thing intended, as we have said, by <i>going </i>as used by the
Prophet. As soon, then, as men devise for themselves some new modes of worship,
it is the same thing as though they turned backward or willfully wandered, for
they keep not in the right and legitimate way. We also learn from the second
clause that idolaters in vain adduce pretences to excuse themselves. For if they
transfer to another what peculiarly belongs to God, and what he claims for
himself, it is more than a sufficient proof of idolatry; and incense, as I have
said, was a symbol of divine worship. As then they offered incense to their
idols, they robbed the true God of his own honor, and chose new gods, and
adorned them with the rights of the only true God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In vain, then, and foolishly do the Papists at this
day seek evasions when we object to them and say, that gross idolatries prevail
among them: &#8220;<i>He!</i> it is not our intention to transfer the worship
which peculiarly belongs to the only true God to saints, to images; but we apply
all this to God.&#8221; Since they burn incense to saints, images, and pictures,
since they offer incense even to the dead, there is surely no further need of
disputing the point; and when they try to evade whatever they can bring forward,
it is confuted by this one expression of the Prophet, for when he speaks of
incense, he condemns the Jews for their idolatry.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as I have said, he speaks afterwards generally,
and says, <i>and to serve alien gods. </i>Then it follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whom they knew not, neither ye
nor your fathers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here the Prophet
amplifies the sin of his own nation, because they had devoted their attention to
unknown gods. There is here again a contrast to be understood, that is, between
God, who had revealed himself by his Law, by his Prophets, by so many miracles
and blessings, and the fictitious gods, who had, without thought and without
judgment, been invented and contrived by the Jews. Now, it was an evidence of a
base and an intolerable ingratitude, that the Jews should have forsaken the true
God after he had made himself known to them. For had the Law never been given,
had God suffered them, as other nations, to be entangled in their own errors,
their offense would have been lighter. But God had made himself to be so
familiarly known to them, that he was pleased to give them his Law, to be a
certain rule of religion; he had also exercised his miraculous powers among
them. As, then, the knowledge of the true God had been made so remarkably clear
to them, how great and how base was their ingratitude to reject him and to
depart from him, in order to run after idols! when they contrived for themselves
vain gods and nothing but fictions! Had any one inquired what sort of god was
Baal, or what were their Baalim, they would have said, that they had Baalim as
their patrons, who obtained favor for them with the supreme God. But whence had
they derived their vain notion? It was nothing but superstition founded on no
reason.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This ought to be carefully observed; for at this day
were any one to ask the Papists by what right they have devised for themselves
so various and so many modes of worship: devotion alone they say will suffice,
or a good intention. Let us then know that religion, separated from knowledge,
is not]ting but the sport and delusion of Satan. It is hence necessary that men
should with certainty know what god they worship. And Christ thus distinguishes
the true worship of God from that of vain idols,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;We know,&#8221; he
says, speaking of the Jews, &#8220;whom we worship.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430422&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
4:22)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says that the <i>Jews </i>knew, even those
who worshipped God according to what the Law prescribes, &#8212; he says that
they knew whom they worshipped. He then condemns all good intentions in which
the superstitious delight themselves, for they know not whom they worship. And I
have said that religion ought not to be separated from knowledge; but I call
that knowledge, not what is innate in man, or what is by diligence acquired, but
that which is delivered to us by the Law and <i>the
</i>Prophets.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, understand why the Prophet says that
the Jews devoted themselves to alien gods, whom
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they had not
known</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>nor their
fathers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now follows a circumstance by which their impiety was
still further enhanced, that God had <i>sent </i>them Prophets who stretched
forth their hands to them to draw them from their errors. For had they never
been warned, their condemnation would have been just; for God had once shewn to
them by his Law what was right. The teaching, then, of the Law ought to have
been sufficient for all ages. But when God had never <i>ceased to </i>send
Prophets, one after another, it was a sign of hopeless obstinacy to reject so
many and so constant warnings. God then added this circumstance that it might
appear that the Jews were wholly inexcusable, and worthy of a hundred and of a
thousand deaths, because they had so perversely despised all the means of
salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But God says, that he had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sent to them all his
servants</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>What is universal has its own
peculiar importance; for if one or two Prophets had been sent, the Jews would
have been proved guilty; for the law does not require more than two or three
witnesses to condemn those who have done wrong.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;051706&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
17:6.) But God shews here that there had been a vast number of those, through
whom, had they been believed, the Jews might have been preserved in safety. They
might, then, have been proved guilty, not only by three or four witnesses, but
even by a great number; for the Prophets had continually succeeded one another.
And thus had been fulfilled what God had promised in the Law,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;A Prophet will I
raise up from the midst of thy brethren, him shalt thou hear; and every one who
will not hear that Prophet shall be cut off from his people.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;051818&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
18:18, 19)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For God shews in his proclaimed Law, that this would
be one of his chief blessings, ever to keep the Jews in the knowledge of their
duty, by never leaving them destitute of Prophets and faithful teachers, here
then he shews that he had ever really performed what he had promised by Moses;
for he does not say that he had only sent a few, but, as I have said, that there
had been a copious abundance; for in every age there were several Prophets, and
some, when it became necessary, succeeded others. But what had been the fruit?
He afterwards complains that all the Prophets had been
rejected.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But to render their sin still more heinous, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rising up early and
sending</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Of this kind of speaking an
explanation has been elsewhere given.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240713&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
7:13;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;241107&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
11:7) It is a metaphorical language; for God rises not nor does he change
places; but here he applies to himself what peculiarly belongs to men. For he
who is attentive to business, does not wait till the sun rises, but anticipates
the morning dawn. So also the Prophet says, that God had been vigilant, for he
had been solicitous concerning the wellbeing of the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We further learn from this mode of speaking how
invaluable is the benefit which God bestows when he raises up honest and
faithful teachers; for it is the same as when the head of a family rises early
from his bed, calls up his children, and takes care of them. Let us, then, know
that teaching, when it is communicated to us, is an evidence of God&#8217;s
paternal solicitude, because he would not have us to perish, but comes down to
us and sees what is needful, as though he were present with us, and as a father
towards his children, he takes care of us and of our affairs. This is the
meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now adds the substance of his message,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Do not the thing of this
abomination which I hate</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>God intimates,
in short, that it had not been through him that the Jews did not return from
their errors to the right way, because he had stretched forth his hand to them,
and had, as it were, sup-pliantly requested them to provide better for
themselves, and not knowingly and willfully to seek their own destruction,
]laving acted as though he were a husband, who, being anxious to preserve the
fidelity of his wife, might thus say to <i>her, &#8212; &#8220;Behold, </i>thou
knowest that I cannot endure unchaste-ness; beware, then, lest thou shouldest
prostitute thyself to adulterers.&#8221; So God shews here that he had testified
by all his servants, that all kinds of idolatry were displeasing to him, in
order that the Jews might keep themselves from idolatry.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But they hearkened not, nor
inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense to alien
gods</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here God charges the Jews with
irreclaimable obstinacy, for the teaching of the Law did not retain them in
obedience, nor did they attend to it, though often and at different times warned
and admonished by the Prophets. And their perverseness he still more clearly
sets forth by the second clause, when he says that they did
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not incline their
ear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Had he said, &#8220;They have not
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hearkened</i></font><font face="Palatino">,&#8221;
it would have been quite sufficient; but when he adds, &#8220;They have not
inclined their ear,&#8221; he expresses, as I have said, something worse than
contempt, even that they designedly rejected the teaching of the Prophets, that
they disdained to hear the Prophets or to listen to their admonitions, but
became willingly deaf, nay, closed up their ears, as rebels do, who are said
elsewhere to harden their heart. We now then understand the import of this
verse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On this account has my wrath and
my fury been poured forth, and has burned through the cities of Judah, and
through the streets of Jerusalem; and this day they are a waste and a
desolation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hmm&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shimme, </i>sometimes means amazement, as it has been before stated; but when
it is connected with
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hbrj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cherebe, </i>as here, it means desolation. <i>As at this day; a </i>dreadful
waste was then at that time apparent, he again refers to this truth, that the
Jews ought to have been so touched by that remarkable and memorable instance of
God&#8217;s displeasure, as not to abandon themselves afterwards to new
idolatries; they ought to have remembered so recent an example of punishment.
As, then, they still persevered in their hardness, it was an evidence of extreme
impiety. The Prophet says that the perverseness of the Jews had not been
unpunished, for God&#8217;s wrath had been poured forth against the cities of
Judah, nay, against Jerusalem itself, the sanctuary of God, so that all things
had been reduced to desolation. The Jews then ought, on the one hand, seriously
to have considered how inexcusable had been their impiety in having so
perversely despised God; and then they ought on the other hand, to have
entertained fear and dread, since they saw that God had taken such vengeance on
those who had despised his teaching and violated his worship.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why then do ye now this great
evil against your own souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and
suckling</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> from the midst of Judah,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that nothing may remain for
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? he</i>re at length the passage is
finished; for what we have hitherto read would have kept the reader in suspense,
had not this been added. He then says, &#8220;Since the sin of your fathers
ought to have been detested by you, and since God&#8217;s judgment had been
dreadful, and that punishment ought at this day to fill, you with fear,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>how is
it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that ye seek to bring on yourselves
again the vengeance of God?&#8221;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why
then</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>now</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>etc. This <i>now </i>is emphatical, that is, after so many and so remarkable
examples, after so many admonitions, after the most grievous punishment
inflicted on the obstinate. He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>against your own
souls</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and by this he touched them very
sharply, reminding them that what they were doing would be to their ruin, as
though he had said, that God would receive no loss from their wickedness, but
that they would become the authors of their own destruction, he indeed
intimates, as I have already said, that their impiety would not be without its
punishment; but he shews at the same time that God could, if he thought proper,
look down with indifference on their impieties; for he would remain perfect even
if they were the worst. For when God is robbed by men of his just and legitimate
worship, there is nothing taken away from his greatness; for he ever remains the
same, and is neither advanced nor diminished through the will of men. Then the
Prophet shews that the Jews were acting madly for their own ruin, when he says,
that they did evil </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>against their
own souls</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this he explains more fully by adding,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To cut off man and woman, child
and suckling, from the midst of Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>He intimates that God still manifested his mercy, while there was any
remnant. They might have remained in Judea, even in their own inheritance; and
the country might have been inhabited till the time of seventy years had
elapsed, which God had fixed for the exile. Now the Prophet shews that they
fought as it were against the goodness of God, for they sought to extinguish
their own name, so that nothing should remain of that people, to whom God had
still left some seed, that they might not wholly perish.</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I was in the last Lecture obliged to cut short the
subject of the Prophet; for this verse depends on the foregoing, and is to be
read together with it. The Prophet asked why the Jew&#8217;s willingly cut off
from themselves every hope of safety, and were seeking their own ruin. He now
expresses the matter more fully, even that they were provoking God&#8217;s wrath
by their superstitions. He then points out the cause of all evils, &#8212; the
pollution of God&#8217;s true worship by idolatries.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We here see that there is no end of sinning, when men
despise God and allow themselves every license in doing evil: God was unwilling
that the Jews should go to Egypt; for he had promised to cherish them as it were
under his own wings; and thus he intended to shew them mercy, so that they might
remain in safety, though in a country then miserable and desolate. But against
his command they went into Egypt. When they came there, in order to gain favor
with the Egyptians, they polluted themselves with vain superstitions. They might
in the land of Judah have worshipped God in purity without any danger.
Distrusting the favor of God they fled into Egypt; and the fear of men led them
to deny their religion. We hence see how one evil proceeds from another; when
the Jews coveted the favor of that heathen nation, they polluted themselves with
many ungodly superstitions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is the sin which the Prophet now refers to,
&#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To provoke
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by the works of your
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There is here to be understood a
contrast between the works which God had commanded, and those which men had
devised for themselves. The altar and the whole Temple were indeed works done by
the hand and art of men; but as God had commanded the altar to be made and the
Temple to be built, the Temple was not, properly speaking, a human but a divine
work, it having been commanded. But whatever men devise of themselves for the
purpose of worshipping God, is what is called the work of their hands; for they
invent things themselves, and follow only their own fancies; they attend not to
what pleases God, but give <i>license </i>to their own imaginations, so that
according to their own will they mingle together any sort of worship they
please. This, then, is the reason, and according to this sense it is, that the
Prophet says, that the <i>Jews </i>provoked God by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the works
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hands</i></font><font face="Palatino">:
they corrupted his lawful worship and <i>departed </i>from true religion, when
they attached themselves to heathen Actions and corruptions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To offer incense to alien
gods</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Under one particular thing, as it
has been already said, the Prophet includes what is general, for the Jews did
not only sin by offering incense, but also through various other superstitions.
But by stating a part for the whole, he clearly intimates that they denied the
true God when they worshipped idols. And then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the land of
Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>into which ye have entered,
that ye might dwell there.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he takes away
the excuse which they might have made, that they were constrained by fear,
because they were unhappy exiles, and saw that their own religion would not be
tolerated by that proud nation. The Prophet says that they had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>into Egypt when God commanded them to remain in the land of Judah. That
plea, then, could not have been admitted, that being terrified by danger they
sought to please the Egyptians, for they brought themselves into that bondage,
when they might have been at liberty in the land of Judah to worship God in
purity. This is the reason why he says that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>came into
Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to sojourn there.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He at length adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to cut you
off.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The construction is indeed
different, but the meaning is clear. He intimates, in short, as he said in the
last verse, that they willingly, and as it were designedly, rushed headlong into
their own ruin. He then adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and
ye shall be a curse and a reproach among all
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By which words he means that
their destruction would be memorable; and this was harder than if their memory
was buried with their life. But the Prophet says that their death would be such
an example as that they would be deemed <i>execrable </i>by all. In short, he
<i>declares </i>that they would be exposed to all kinds of reproaches even after
their death. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now sets forth how extremely shameful was
the insensibility of the Jews, in not acknowledging that God had most severely
and grievously punished the superstitions to which they had previously been
addicted. At the same time, if we regard the word used, he seems not to
understand punishments by <i>evils, </i>but raffler the wicked deeds by which
they had provoked God. And this ought to be observed, for some interpreters give
this rendering, &#8220;Have you forgotten your evils and those of your
fathers;<i>&#8221; </i>that is, how severely God had afflicted you? But there is
no doubt but that the Prophet means by
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tw[r</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>rout, </i>their sins, by which they had exposed themselves to God&#8217;s
judgment; for it immediately follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which they
did,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or committed,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the land of Judah, and in the

means by this word the sins of the people, there is yet no doubt but that he
includes also the punishments by which they ought to have known that the impiety
in which they continued most obstinately had displeased God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When therefore the Prophet says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Have ye forgotten
</i></font><font face="Palatino">your evils and those of your fathers? he takes
it for granted that it was sufficiently known that God had taken vengeance on
them for their sins; for he does not address the Jews in their prosperity, but
when they were fugitives from their own land and under the curse of heaven. As,
then, they were evidently condemned by God, the Prophet justly asks them,
&#8220;Have ye forgotten that you have been condemned for the sins of your
fathers and those of your kings, even for those which they had committed?&#8221;
This he asked, because it was a horrid stupidity, that though the <i>city
</i>had been overthrown and the temple burnt, they did not yet leave off their
superstitions, especially when so singular a vengeance of God ought to have
retained their posterity in fear and obedience even for ten ages. Thus we see
that punishment is linked with sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,

&#8220;of every one of them;<i>&#8221; </i>but there is no need, it being a
singular number, referring to a collective noun, Judah. he afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which they
did</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This ought not to be confined to
the women, (nor is it suitable,) but it refers to all the Jews as well as to

Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he mentions
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the streets of
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he exaggerates their
wickedness. For we know that city to have been as it were the earthly sanctuary
of God. It, was then a most disgraceful impiety to pollute that place which God
had consecrated for himself. The whole land of Judah was indeed under his
authority and power, but he had favored the city, and especially Mount Sion,
with singular privileges. Then the Prophet amplifies the greatness of their sin,
when he says that Jerusalem had been polluted by their
superstitions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">he afterwards mentions how great had been the
perverseness of that people, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
are not humbled</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to this
day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>though they had been most severely
smitten by the rods of God. Even fools, when smitten, become wise, as the old
proverb says. As the Jews then had been so grievously chastised by God&#8217;s
hand, and had experienced extreme rigor, ought they not to have considered what
they had deserved? But the Prophet shews that their wickedness was past remedy,
for though broken down they were not yet humbled, like those who are of a
perverse disposition, who could not be reformed were they broken down a hundred
times. Then the Prophet upbraids the Jews with their obstinacy, for not even the
greatest calamity had brought them to obedience.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They were not then humbled to that day, nor did they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Fear ought also to be referred here to the calamities which <i>they </i>had
<i>experienced, </i>for God had sufficiently shewn that he had been grievously
offended with their impiety. As then God&#8217;s dreadful judgment had been made
conspicuous to all, the Prophet here condemns their dullness, <i>because
</i>they had not been brought back to a sound mind so as to fear God. He now
adds another instance of obstinacy, that they had not <i>walked </i>in the Law
of God and in his commandments. Then he shows that their obstinacy was twofold,
that they had profited nothing by his teaching, and that they had disregarded
his punishments. The Law itself was to them a rule according to which they were
to worship God, nor ought they to have sought elsewhere what they were to do.
As, then, they had in the Law a revelation as to true religion, it was an
intolerable contempt to depart from it of their own accord, and to abandon
themselves to all kinds of errors. But the Prophet shews that they had been
extremely unteachable, because they had not only cast aside every regard for the
Law, but they had also despised God&#8217;s hand, and refused to be corrected by
any punishments.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That he might shew still further that they had sinned
through sheer wickedness, he says, They have not walked in my Law
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>nor in my
statutes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This second clause seems to be
superfluous; but the Prophet here commends the clear teaching of the Law, as
though God had said that he had not only shewn in a brief manner what was true
and right, but that he had also by many statutes taught the Jews, so that they
had no pretext for their ignorance. And he confirms the same thing in other
words, when he says that he had <i>put </i>these statutes
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before their
face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for by these words he intimates
that there is nothing obscure in the Law, and that the Jews therefore had not
gone astray through want of knowledge; for men always extenuate by evasions
their sins, when their impiety is condemned. The Prophet then says that the Jews
were inexcusable, because the rule of true religion had been set before their
eyes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this passage testifies that the teaching of the
Law is not doubtful, as some profane men say, who hold that Scripture may be
turned anyhow like a nose of wax. But God declares that he had not spoken
ambiguously. Since, then, the Prophet affirms that the Law had been set before
the eyes of the Jews, that they might surely know the will of God, we ought to
maintain at this day, that in the Gospel, clearly discovered to us by the coming
of Christ, there is nothing obscure, but that the treasures of all knowledge
have been made known to us, as far as it is necessary, so that they who now go
astray in vain pretend that they do so because the will of God is hid from them;
for in no other way can they err than by dissembling and willfully closing their
eyes, lest the brightness of the sun should reach them. Let us yet know that the
more plainly God is made known to us, the more grievously we sin when we turn
aside from his true worship and service; for he has omitted nothing in his word
which is necessary in order to worship him acceptably. Since, then, we have
before our eyes the rule of a godly life, except we follow it this reproof
belongs to us, that God has set before our eyes his statutes. It now follows,

<div><font face="Palatino">He confirms in this verse what he had said in the
last, that he would again take vengeance on impiety, as he had done previously.
The Jews were before visited with a very grievous calamity, when inebriated with
prosperity; but now, when God would have shaken from off them their torpor, the
Prophet justly reminds them of the calamities which they had suffered: <i>As,
</i>then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I visited Jerusalem, so
will I visit those who dwell in Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>But the argument is also from the greater to the less; for if God had not
spared the holy city, in which he had chosen a habitation, how should he spare
Egypt? for Egypt was not worthy that God should regard it. We know that it was a
profane and an accursed land. It was, then, the greatest madness for the Jews to
hope to be safe in Egypt, when they could not have been so in the holy land,
which was God&#8217;s sanctuary, which was their heritage, which was even
God&#8217;s rest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see the object of the Prophet; for he set
before &#183; them the ruin of the city and of the land of Judah, that they
might know that they could not escape the hand of God while they dwelt in Egypt
contrary to his command, for God would be a severer judge to them there than he
had been before in the land of Judah. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet seems to be inconsistent with himself;
for at the beginning of the verse he says that there would be no residue, but at
the end he adds an exception, that there would be few alive, who would flee,
and, by some miracle, escape from death. Some take this view, that none of the
ungodly despisers would remain, but that some would yet be preserved alive, even
those who had been drawn there against their own will, such as Jeremiah, Baruch,
and such as were like them. But this explanation may seem forced at the first
view; and yet if the Prophet is speaking of the Jews who had fled into Egypt, it
is necessary so to take it; otherwise there would be a manifest inconsistency
and contradiction. But we may also refer what he says at the end of the verse to
the exiles in Babylon; for they who had concealed themselves in Egypt thought
that it was all over with all others, because they had been led away into a
distant country. As, then, a return to their country was closed up against them,
they thought that they themselves would become the sole heirs of the land; for
as Egypt was not far from the land of Judah, a return was easy, and also free,
because they had made a treaty with the Egyptians; and further, they had gone to
them as friends to partake of their hospitality. They, then, who dwelt in Egypt
thought that the land of Judah would be their own.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But God says that none would return into that land

p<i>elethim, </i>at the end of the verse, as referring to the remnant which God
would at length gather, when liberty to return was granted to the <i>Jews </i>by
the edict of Cyrus, at the end of the seventy years, which the Prophet had
before mentioned. And this seems to me a simpler meaning, that. is, that none
would remain of that remnant which had gone down to Egypt, who <i>came, </i>as
it is expressed, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to sojourn in

the <i>confidence </i>by which the Jews still deceived themselves; for the
lifting up of which he speaks, means to aspire or to hope, and denotes pride and
presumption. So by saying that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lifted up their
souls</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he reproves them, because they
were still inflated with a foolish hope, and persuaded themselves that a return
would soon be open for them, as the land was without any possessors. As, then,
they were cherishing themselves with such delusions, they were to know that they
were never to return there, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They

<div><font face="Palatino">Here is more fully seen the irreclaimable obstinacy
of that nation; for Jeremiah had given them more than sufficient evidences of
his integrity. They ought then to have been fully convinced that he was a true
Prophet of God. Though they had disregarded him for forty years and more, he had
yet given full proof of his legation when he had constantly, even to the last,
prophesied of the destruction of the city and the Temple. They had, then, learnt
by their own calamities that Jeremiah was an instrument of the Holy Spirit, and
a true interpreter of God&#8217;s will. And it hence appears how blind they were
when they rejected all his admonitions, and counted his threatenings as fables.
Thus, as in a mirror, the Holy Spirit of God sets before us how great the
madness of men is when Satan once takes possession of their minds. But let us,
at the same time, learn that this is the reward rendered to obstinacy, when
God&#8217;s Prophets are despised. It was, indeed, a monstrous and most
disgraceful thing, when they dared so insolently to repudiate the holy Prophet,
while, at the same time, they had been reduced to the greatest extremities, and
when spoiled of all things, had fled into Egypt, and lived there, as we have
seen, in a servile and miserable condition. Inasmuch, then, as they were still
ferocious and still arrogant towards God&#8217;s Prophet, it hence appears that
they were untamable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says, that <i>all the men </i>to whom the
impiety of their wives was known,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>answered
Jeremiah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By these words the Prophet
intimates that the beginning of idolatry was from the women. Things then had not
as yet gone so far that all the men openly worshipped idols; but the women had
taken this liberty, and the men readily indulged them. But why then did the
Prophet before reprove them, as though they all made <i>incense </i>to idols? We
doubtless learn from this passage, that they are not only guilty before God who
openly do what is wicked, but also those who by connivance tolerate them; for
the men ought to have interfered so as to restrain their wives from polluting
themselves with ungodly superstitions; but this they patiently endured. Then
their consent was the same as the deed, as we may rightly conclude from the
words of the Prophet. He then says, that the men offered incense, not indeed
openly and with their own hands, but that they knew of their wives, and that
this impiety was done by the women with their consent. The rest I cannot now

not do what the Prophet commanded them, though he spoke to them in the name of
God. They did not answer distinctly, that the word of God or his oracle to them
was of no account, but impeached the fidelity of Jeremiah, as though he had
alleged the name of God falsely.</font><br></div>

&#8220;In the great assembly.&#8221; But I have no doubt but that the Prophet
means, that the answer was given in common by the men and by the women. He then
says, that the women were at the same time present. He afterwards adds,

they did not think that they were bound to obey the command of man. And whence
was this contempt? even from nothing but perverseness; for however hypocrites
may dissemble and say that they do not despise God and his word, and address
their words to ministers, yet their impiety betrays them when, on the one hand,
they pretend that they worship God, and on the other they repudiate those
furnished with his commands whom he would have them to hear. But God will not
and cannot have himself separated from his word. Let us now go on

<div><font face="Palatino">Here they shew more openly their obstinacy; for
having said that they had no faith in Jeremiah, as he had not been sent by God,
they now add that they would indeed be the worshippers of God, but according to
their own will. We have here discovered to us the fountain of all superstitions.
This passage sufficiently proves whence these flow, and from what source proceed
all the corruptions by which religion has been vitiated in all ages, even from
the willfulness and pride of men. While therefore men arrogate so much to
themselves as to make a law respecting the worship of God, all things must
necessarily go wrong. It was for this reason I said that this is the origin of
all errors. How then is religion to remain pure? even by depending on
God&#8217;s mouth, by subjecting ourselves to his word, and by putting a bridle
on ourselves, so as not to introduce anything except what he commands and
approves. The right rule then as to the worship of God is, to adopt nothing but
what he prescribes. On the other hand religion becomes vitiated and degenerates
into superstition as soon as men seek to be legislators for themselves, when
they say, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Doing we shall do every
word that cometh forth from our mouth.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This willfulness is indeed what humble men will
condemn if they only consult common sense; but it is an evil innate in all, to
seek to worship God as it seems good to them. But Jeremiah here paints for us as
it were on a tablet the beginning of all superstitions: men set up their own
will and fancies in opposition to the commands of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To offer incense to the
frame-work of the heavens.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Interpreters
differ as to the meaning of this clause. We have stated some things already in
the seventh chapter; but as a great part of you were not then present, it is
necessary to repeat what was then said. Some derive the last word but one from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;lm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>melek, </i>which means to reign; and <i>hence </i>they give this rendering,
&#8220;to the queen of the heavens;&#8221; and this is the explanation of
<i>Jerome. </i>But others derive the word from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;al</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>lak, </i>and render it &#8220;work;&#8221; and some more rashly,
&#8220;ministry;&#8221; and others, &#8220;framework,&#8221; or, fabric,
(<i>machina.</i>)<i> </i>There are also those deduce the word from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;lh</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>elek, </i>which is to walk; and they think that all the stars or planets are
included in this term; and we indeed see that walking or motion is what belongs
to all the stars. But if the word comes from the verb to reign, &#8220;the queen
of the heavens&#8221; must be taken for the principal star, as the Chaldee
paraphrase regards it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But some consider that the sun is intended, and some
the moon. The sun in Hebrew is of the feminine gender; therefore the sun may
properly be called a queen in that language. But if we take it as meaning
frame-work, one of the radical letters
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>aleph, </i>is wanting, as in the seventh chapter. The Prophet, however, seems
to mention here the whole machinery of the heavens, as though the unbelieving
had said, that as wonderful glory appeared there, their worship was doubtless
pleasing to God, when his majesty was adored in the stars and in the whole
frame-work of the heavens. I do not therefore consider that one starts meant,
but the very heavens or all the stars; and though the word is in the singular
number, yet it means what is commonly called the hosts of
heaven.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They then said, &#8220;We shall go on in our usual
manner; for we have hitherto offered <i>incense to the fabric </i>(or the
frame-work) <i>of the heavens, </i>and poured libations; we shall not then
desist from what we have usually done: &#8220;and they further said, &#8220;So
have we done, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>we, and our
fathers, and our kings, and our
princes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.&#8221; </i>Here they set up the
authority of fathers in opposition to the authority of God, as it was usually
done.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We see also in our day that the Papists
superciliously boast of the Fathers and the Catholic Church, when the plain
truth is brought forward. They think that darkness overspreads the Word of God,
and that whatever is adduced from the Law, from the Prophets, and from the
Gospel, is reduced to nothing when they object and say that it is otherwise,
that the fathers have spoken otherwise, that it was otherwise understood in old
times. We hence see that the Papists of this day fight with the same weapons as
idolaters formerly employed; and though the devil transforms himself in various
ways, yet superstitious men ever adopt this principle, that whatever is handed
down from our forefathers ought to be held sacred; and hypocrites do especially
harden themselves in this error, when they can boast of kings and princes, as
was the case in this instance; for they said, that they followed what had been
done, not only by the common people, but even by kings and princes. They took it
as granted that kings and princes could not have fallen into ignorance. The
truth is, that greatness and splendor cover the ignorance and folly of kings. So
when simple men speak of kings, their eyes are blinded or dazzled by the
magnificence displayed, so that they think kings to be without dispute wise and
endowed with the best understanding. Hence it is that Satan is wont often to use
such masks for the purpose of deceiving men. Let us therefore learn to render to
God altogether the honor of prescribing by his word the law as to religion; and
thus let no altitude or dignity be allowed to overshadow the authority of God;
but on the contrary, let kings and princes be constrained to submit when God
appears.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They afterwards added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the cities of Judah, and in
the streets of Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And they
mentioned these places in order to sanction their own superstitions; for the
holiness of Jerusalem was to them a cover for all vices, as we see to be the
case at this day with respect to Rome, which is boastfully extolled by the
Papists, as though the hypocrisy which sends forth the most nauseous filth
through the whole world, were the most perfect holiness. Whatever then comes
from Rome, they would have to be counted as a heavenly oracle. In the same
manner the wretched Jews dared to set up Jerusalem in opposition to God. Great,
indeed, was the dignity of the city, not such is that of Rome at this day; for
the Papists have not taken from God&#8217;s word the encomiums, by which they
extol that city, which is really a foetid and an abominable brothel. Jerusalem
had its dignity from God himself; but the Jews in their folly degraded Jerusalem
when they corrupted the Law and instituted fictitious worship, according to
their own will. And yet we see that they armed themselves with this name, as a
weapon, against the Prophet, as though they brought God to fight against
himself. Jerusalem had no dignity but that with which God himself had favored
it; but they boasted that it was a holy city, that whatever was done in it was
to be deemed holy and lawful, and not to be disputed, as though God&#8217;s Law
had been lying buried under the dignity of the city. Now Jerusalem had derived
its splendor and all the dignity it had from the Law only. But this, as I have
said, was the wickedness of men, that they corrupted and perverted the benefits
of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They then added, that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>satisfied with
bread</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>when they burned
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>incense to the
work</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or workmanship
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the
heavens</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It has ever been a common thing
with the despisers of God, that they have been inebriated with earthly things,
so as to disregard God himself, and to think that all their superstitions would
go unpunished. But whence comes this error? even because men deceive themselves,
when God patiently bears with them. God does not immediately take vengeance on
the profanation of his name, he does not immediately punish hypocrites and
idolaters, he does not immediately fulminate against ungodly and spurious modes
of worship: his forbearance seems to be taken as an inducement to sin, as an
excitement to licentiousness. When, therefore, the Jews adduced this defense,
that they were <i>satisfied with bread, </i>it was the same thing as though they
had said, &#8220;As long as God spared us, and suspended his judgment, it was
well with us.&#8221; But they ought not to have abused the forbearance of God,
and thus to have heaped on themselves judgment, as Paul says. Now there was also
another cause of error, for when God drew men back from error by chastising them
more severely, as they deserved, after seeing they were still obstinate, they
then began so to regard God&#8217;s judgment, as foolishly to think that the
cause proceeded from religion being changed. So, at the beginning of the Gospel
we see that there were similar complaints among all the ungodly, as the ancients
have recorded, and especially <i>Tertullian, </i>in his apologies: &#8220;If the
Tiber inundated, if any calamity happened, if hail or frost, the fault was
ascribed to the name of Christ and his doctrine. From the time religion has been
changed, we have not ceased to be miserable.&#8221; But they did not consider as
they ought to have done, that when they were blind and sunk in errors, God for a
long time bore with them, and that after the doctrine of the gospel had shone
forth, they still wickedly followed their accustomed impiety, which before might
have been excused on the ground of ignorance: from the time God had shewn to
them the way of salvation, they had resisted it, as it were designedly and
willfully, so that they deserved a heavier punishment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Such was the impiety of the ancient people according
to this answer, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We were satisfied
with bread</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>when we poured out libations
to the frame-work of the heavens; that is, as God did not immediately punish
their impiety, they were happy and saw no evil. And yet it is certain that they
said what was untrue, for God had often chastised them, and at the time they
were sedulous and devoted to their false worship. They had gone astray to
idolatry before Jeremiah was born; nay, before Isaiah had commenced his office
as a Prophet: and we know how severely at that time God punished them for their
wickedness; for in the time of Isaiah the kingdom of Israel was distressed, and
then wholly destroyed. Jerusalem, as Isaiah says, became like a cottage, and the
whole country was laid waste; and at this time they poured out libations to the
workmanship of heaven and burnt incense. We know how great was the zeal of Ahaz,
and of other wicked kings. Hezekiah, indeed, and Josiah labored to restore the
pure worship of God; but Manasseh, the son and successor of Hezekiah,
immediately subverted everything. While then they were so fervid in their
superstitions, did all things succeed according to their wishes, as they now
boasted? By no means, for God pursued them with the sword, with famine, and with
pestilence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What then did this boasting mean, that they were
<i>satisfied </i>with bread, and were <i>happy, </i>and saw no <i>evil, </i>at
the time they poured out libations? The truth is, that madness so drives on
headlong the ungodly, that they perceived not God&#8217;s hand, when stretched
forth against them. But even had they truly said, that they were <i>happy </i>at
the time they pro-stituted themselves to idols, yet they could not have hence
inferred, that their false worship was approved by God; for when he bears with
men for a time, he does not yet cease to be their judge; for he will at length,
in his own time, sum-. mort to his tribunal the ungodly whom he has long spared.
In short, hypocrites at first trifle with God, and thus turn his mercy to an
occasion of sinning, as though there were no punishment; this is one thing: and
in the second place, they are not roused by the scourges of God, but remain
stupid when God chastises them. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here he enlarges on their ingratitude, that they
attributed to God the fault of all their calamities, when yet God would have
drawn them, as the Prophet will hereafter tell us, as it were out of darkness
into light, had they been reclaimable. They ought to have been restored, by
punishments, to their right mind. But this had been so far from being the case,
that the effect of God&#8217;s scourges had been to render them more and more
obstinate.</font><br></div>

punishments which they had suffered for having so often, and for so long a time,
rebelled against God? But they willfully <i>covered </i>over God&#8217;s
judgments: and yet they said that they had been in every way miserable, since
they had <i>ceased </i>from false worship. But was it for this reason they
became miserable, because they no longer poured out libations to stars and
idols? Nay, the reason was very different, as the Prophet will presently answer
them. But we must repeat all their words; we shall come afterwards to the
refutation given by the Prophet.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">They brought forward another argument, that they were
not a small portion, but the whole people, who then flourished in prosperity,
when they offered incense to idols. We know that but a few remained of that
large multitude, which lived when the kingdom as yet existed. They said then
that they were not the sole authors of this superstition, but that it was
practiced by a large number of men, even the whole people, when Jerusalem was
full of inhabitants, and the whole country.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some explain this of the women, but improperly, as I
think. The masculine gender is sometimes applied to women, but seldom, and it is
harsh, and then it agrees not with this passage, where the whole context shews
that men are spoken of; but one reason only leads them to think so, and that is
frivolous. It is said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Have we
done this without our men? </i></font><font face="Palatino">When, therefore,
they said that they had not acted without the men, it has immediately occurred

brought forward the consent of a large multitude, as though they had said,

the ancient condition of the city and of the land with our miserable state, when
the kingdom flourished, when the city remained in safety, when the whole country
was full of inhabitants, did they not all then, with one consent, worship the
stars and the workmanship of the heavens? Since, then, this religion has been

it. In like manner did these wretched men contend with Jeremiah; and this

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet refutes the impious objections by which
the Jews had attempted to subvert and to render contemptible his doctrine, he
then turns against them all that they had falsely boasted. They had at the
beginning said, <i>&#8220;Our kings, </i>our <i>princes, </i>and our <i>fathers,
</i>had before used these rites; and they have been delivered to us, as it were,
by their hands.&#8221; To this Jeremiah answers, <i>&#8220;This </i>is certainly
true, and for this reason it was that God became so severe a judge of their
impiety, when he took away your fathers from the world, when he wholly destroyed
the kingdom itself, when he demolished the city, and when at length he afflicted
you with all kinds of evils: for except your kings, and your fathers, and your
princes, had been impious towards God, he would have never treated them with so
much severity; for he has promised to be a Father to the children of Abraham.
God, then, must have been grievously offended with you, and your fathers, and
your kings, when his wrath thus burned against them.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is, then, here a retort; for as we see that the
Prophet turns against them what they had adduced against him. This is the sum of
what is said.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that he spoke to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the whole
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>both men and women, and he
repeats </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the whole
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because all had subscribed to
the impious calumny. Then God says, &#8220;For this reason have I destroyed your
city and you, even because ye burnt incense to-your idols.&#8221; The truth of
what they had boasted is allowed, but it is turned to a meaning different from
what they thought. For, as their fathers and their kings had imbibed
superstitions, they supposed that they were doing right in following them; for,
as we have said, <i>hypocrites </i>consider use and custom as sufficient reasons
for disregarding the Law. Then, as to the fact itself, the Prophet admits that
what they said was quite true, that this had been the cause of all their evils;
for had not the kings and the whole people provoked the wrath of God, the temple
would not have been demolished, nor the kingdom destroyed; God, in short, would
not have alienated himself from his own people whom he had adopted. This is the
meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
incense</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which ye have burnt in the cities
of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers, your kings, and your
princes, and the whole people of the land, has not Jehovah remembered
them?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Whence, he says, has this dreadful
calamity proceeded, which has destroyed all your race? Even from the wrath of
God, for it has not happened to you by chance, for God had by his servants
predicted what afterwards has been really fulfilled. It then follows, that your
city has been destroyed through the righteous judgment of God. And what has been
the cause of so great and so grievous a vengeance? Even your
incense.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And hence he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah could not endure the
wickedness of your works and the abominations which ye have done:
therefore</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>your land has been reduced to a
waste</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Prophet, in short, shews that
had they not been justly exposed to God&#8217;s judgment, they would not have
been destroyed. For he assumes this principle, that God is not angry without
reason; and then he assumes another principle, that as God had chosen the seed
of Abraham, and had been always propitious even to the unworthy, they would have
been made partakers of his kindness, had not God been wholly alienated from
them. It then follows, that God&#8217;s vengeance had not been thus kindled by
some slight offense, but by many and daily offenses, so that it could no longer
be deferred: for the atrocity of punishment shews the atrocity of sin; and hence
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah could not endure

therefore,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>your land has been made a waste,
an astonishment, and a curse, or execration, so that there is no
inhabitant</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He at length explains more clearly, in other words,
the same thing, on </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>account of
your incense,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and because ye have done
wickedly</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. By naming incense
especially, stating a part for the whole, he refers to all false and corrupt
modes of worship, as it was stated yesterday; but he declares all of them to
have been abominable. Then he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have acted impiously against
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He now exaggerates their sin, for
they had despised all godly admonitions,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye have not
hearkened</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the voice of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I apply this to the discourses
of the Prophets, by which God continued to exhort them to repentance; for he
daily and constantly addressed them, in order to restore them to the way of
salvation. Then the Prophet condemns them, because they hearkened not to the
words of the Prophets.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nor walked in his Law, nor in his
statutes, nor in his testimonies, </i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>he</i>
shews by these words, that even if Prophets had not been sent, one after the
other, the Law ought to have been sufficient for them. But he was not content
with mentioning the Law only, but added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>statutes and
testimonies:</i></font><font face="Palatino"> by which words he intimates, as we
said yesterday, that the doctrine of the Law was clear and
plain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">he at length adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore has all this evil
happened to you, as it appears at this day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>The Prophet, in short, intimates that their guilt was sufficiently proved,
because God had been so angry with them, and they had been so severely
afflicted; for if his judgments are right, it follows that the punishment he
inflicted on the Jews was right. It may also be hence inferred, that they had
been rebellious, because they had perverted and corrupted his true
worship.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">JEREMIAH pursues the same subject, and not only
bitterly reproves the ungodly men who so pertinaciously despised his doctrine,
but also shews that they could gain nothing by their audacity, because they
would at length be violently broken down, as they could not bear to be
corrected, he says at the beginning,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye and your wives have
spoken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>the men are also included, Ye
have spoken both men and women, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with your hands have fulfilled
it;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, your obstinacy is complete,
for, as you have spoken insolently against God, so there has been a performance;
for by <i>hands </i>he designates the work done. he then shews that they had
advanced to the highest pitch of impiety, for they hesitated not to vomit forth
these impious words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We will not
obey God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and they joined their hands to
their mouth, for they strenuously executed what they had said. The thought
itself was sufficient to condemn them; but when they thus spoke with their
tongues, and then employed their hands against God, it was a proof of desperate
audacity, as though they willfully designed to provoke him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he shews what issue awaited these impious men,
who so presumptuously rebelled against God. When he bids them to hear what God
on the other hand had sworn, he compares God with themselves, as though he had
said, <i>&#8220;You </i>may a hundred times increase in your madness, yet God
will be the conqueror; for he is an adversary who will surely subvert all
schemes and efforts.&#8221; But before he comes to this, he mentions what they
said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Doing we shall do our vows
which we have vowed, to burn incense</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>etc. Here Jeremiah relates what we have before seen, that the Jews, under
the pretext of doing what had been before done, continued thus rebellious
against God. We perceive this by the word <i>vows; </i>and the superstitious,
when they are pressed, are wont always to flee to this pretext, that to
persevere in one&#8217;s resolution is a great virtue. While, then, they avoid
the charge of fickleness, they harden themselves against God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The same thing we see at this day under the Papacy:
The older any one is, the more obstinate he is. &#8220;What! have I not learned
during forty or fifty years what religion is, and how to worship God? I have
been thus taught from a child, and have by a long habit followed this way: it
would be now a disgraceful thing for me to change my course and to relinquish
the faith which I have professed for so many years.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is, then, no doubt but the Jews made a pretense
of this kind against Jeremiah, when they said that they had <i>vowed. </i>For
hypocrites make no distinction when they vow anything, but indiscriminately
obtrude on God whatever comes to their minds; they afterwards stand fixed in
their foolish fancies, and say that a. vow is inviolable, a sacred thing. Such
was the excuse of the people. But we see from the Prophet&#8217;s answer how
vainly they did bring forward in opposition to God their vows, which had been
made without judgment and without reason.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this passage ought to be carefully noticed; so
that we may especially know, that it is a folly in no way pleasing to God, when
men indiscriminately vow whatever they may dream according to their own fancies.
God then would have sobriety and regard to his will to be observed as to vows.
But when any one has made an <i>inconsiderate </i>vow, pertinaciously to persist
in it is no less displeasing to God than the vow itself. The Jews had vowed; the
warning of the Prophet ought to have constrained them to change their
resolution. But while they avoided every kind of fickleness, we see that instead
of constancy they set up their own perverseness and diabolical obstinacy in
opposition to God. When, therefore, we rashly make vows, disapproved by God,
nothing is better than immediately to retract them; for we have already sinned
more than enough in having abused the holy name of God. For this reason the
Prophet says, that the Jews spoke thus,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Doing we shall do the vows we
have vowed;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and what were these? To
offer incense to the stars and to hosts of Heaven. Had they vowed anything to
God, they ought not to have broken their pledged faith; but they had made vows
to the devil; then they ought to have immediately changed their purpose. When I
say that vows made to God ought to be performed, I mean lawful vows; for he who
makes a vow without judgment, does not vow to God; but those vows which God
sanctions ought to be deemed sacred; and whatever vows God repudiates, ought to
be counted as nothing. We hence see that the Jews were justly condemned, for
they pertinaciously paid their vows to their own idols.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds by way of irony,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Confirming ye will confirm your
vows, doing ye will do your vows</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here
the Prophet sharply <i>checks </i>their insolence, <i>because </i>they thus set
up themselves against God, as though it were a great virtue to persevere in
their wicked purpose; ye cannot change, he says, but confirming ye will confirm
your vows!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear ye
now</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the word of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. By these words, as I have
already hinted, he intimates, that they could gain nothing by their insolence,
except that they would thereby provoke God, who on the other hand did set up his
own power against them. <i>Thus, </i>then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>saith
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>Behold,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have sworn by my great
name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. As they had so often
disregarded God speaking to them, he confirmed by an oath what he was going to
say. Had he only threatened, they might have as usual disregarded him, as though
the Prophet spoke what was vain. This is the reason why he now introduces God as
making an oath. And it ought to be observed, that whenever God confirms his
words by an oath, this he does, either because he sees that he has to do with
men who are like stones, who cannot be made to feel by simple truth; or when he
is pleased to give aid to our infirmity and sloth: for God confirms threatenings
as well as promises by an oath. When he thus confirms threatenings, then he
indirectly condemns the obstinate wickedness of those whom he addresses. But
when he promises anything by an oath, he shews how great our propensity is to
indulge doubts, and what weakness there is in our faith; for were such faith in
us as ought to be, we should be contented with one little word. As, then, God
interposes his own name as a pledge, it hence appears, that we are naturally
unbelieving, or that the weakness of our faith is such that it wants this
support. But here, as God threatens, he shews that the Jews were so obstinate in
their wickedness, that it was necessary to shake them by
terror.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, God makes an oath
by</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> his own great
name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Men, as the Apostle says, swear by
God,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;580616&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
6:16;) because he is called as a witness and a judge when his name is
interposed. But it is no superfluous addition, when God not only swears by
himself, but by his own </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>great
name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For he thus intimated, that the
Jews were greatly deceived, if they thought that God would not execute vengeance
on them, because they indulged themselves. For it is a common thing with
hypocrites to measure God by their own judgment; and when they extenuate his
power, they think of him as of a child. In order, then, to divest the Jews of
this false imagination, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by his own great
name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There is, then, implied here a
contrast between the greatness of God&#8217;s name, which cannot be diminished
at the will of man, and the presumption of the ancient people, who rendered
God&#8217;s name contemptible.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If my
name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. It is an imperfect sentence,
which, as we have often said, was frequently used in order that a greater
reverence may be observed by us, when we swear by God&#8217;s name. We must now
come to what is said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall
not be a Jew, who is to swear any more in my
name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>God himself makes an oath, and
what is the oath which he makes? that no one was to profane his name; for they
thought that it was some evidence of religion when they swore by Jehovah. It was
yet nothing but an awful profanation of God&#8217;s name. They contaminated
themselves, as it appears, with Egyptian superstitions; but that they might
differ from the Egyptians themselves and possess something special, that they,
in short, might seem to be a holy nation, they still retained a form of
swearing, distinct from what was common among the Gentiles. God declares that he
would not suffer his name to be any more irreverently used in
Egypt</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>. Not
invoked</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be my name any more by the
mouth of a Jew</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And that he speaks of
oaths we gather from the next verse, when he says, <i>Live doth
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah in all the land of
Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For, as it has been said, the
Jews as yet boasted that they kept the <i>Law, </i>because God&#8217;s name was
still in their mouth and on their tongue. But God says that it was to be taken
away from them, because it was a disgraceful pollution of his name, when they
mingled themselves with the Egyptians in all kinds of superstitions, and yet
boasted that they were God&#8217;s people. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here he more dearly expresses what he had said in the
last verse, that none of the Jews would remain alive in Egypt. He now then
points out the manner, even because he would not cease to consume them until
they wholly perished and were brought to final ruin. He had said, No
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>more shall my name be called, nor

observed elsewhere, and explained why the Prophets spoke thus, even because
hypocrites, though they think God cares not for human affairs, and imagine that
he sleeps in heaven, and hence audaciously provoke him, as though they were
fugitives and their purpose hid from God, yet boast of God&#8217;s providence,
and pretend that they acquiesce confidently in him. For this reason the Prophet
answered, that God watched indeed, but
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not for
good</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We then perceive the object of the
Prophet; he derided the presumption of the people, who thought that God had a
care for their safety. He then says, that God indeed does not sleep, but that
this would bring no benefit to hypocrites; for though God watches as a father to
preserve his own people, he yet watches as a judge to destroy all the ungodly.

<div><font face="Palatino">He at length adds that a few would escape. He had
said before,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;244414&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
44:14) that there would be none, but added at the end of the verse,
<i>&#8220;but </i>such as shall escape.&#8221; We said that this second clause
is to be explained of the Jews who had been driven into exile in Babylon. But if
it be applied to exiles in Egypt the meaning will be different. For the Prophet
then said that none would escape, that none would remain alive: he thus
doubtless took away every hope of deliverance with regard to those in Egypt. But
he added, &#8220;but such as shall escape,&#8221; that is, such as should
stealthily escape from the sword, as though they had never migrated into Egypt.
And then in this different sense must necessarily be taken what the Prophet adds
now, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They who escape shall
return</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But we must bear in mind that
those remaining alive would not be numbered among the exiles, for they must have
withdrawn themselves so as no longer to form a part of that people. They had
before become fugitives, but when they departed from Egypt, that second flight
made them to be no longer a residue in that land.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When, therefore, the Prophet declares that none of
the residue would escape, we must understand the words as meaning, that there
would be Jews no more in Egypt, as their memory would be obliterated. But when,
in the second place, he mentions evaders,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yfylp</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>pelithim, </i>(the word which we have rendered, &#8220;They who shall
escape,&#8221;) he means that those who escaped had now ceased to be counted
among the residue, having in a manner of their own accord separated themselves
from them, so that they were no longer to be reckoned among the fugitive exiles
in Egypt. Then he says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>those who escape from the sword
would return into the land of Judah;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>an
event wholly different from what they looked for, for they expected to return to
their own country in a triumphant manner. They intended indeed to dwell in Egypt
only for a time; and they hoped to come afterwards into a free possession of the
land, when the Chaldeans had gone far away. Thus they had promised to themselves
a new kingdom, and were not disposed to return except in great pomp. As, then,
such a restoration had been imagined by them, the Prophet <i>says, </i>that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a few only would
return</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>into the land of
Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and then that they would return,
not to possess the land and enjoy it as their own inheritance, but that they
would return, because there would be no safe corner where they might hide
themselves. We hence see that this return is set up in opposition to the false
imagination in which the Jews indulged; and he says that a few only would
return.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And at length he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All the remnant of Judah who had
entered into the land of Egypt, shall know whose word shall stand, mine, or
theirs</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here at length the sentence is
completed, for I have said that it was the Prophet&#8217;s object to convince
the Jews of their foolish and impious presumption, when in their perverseness
they contended against God, as though he had said, &#8220;What do you mean, ye
wretched beings? Is the truth of God to give way, or can you frustrate his
purpose by your madness and obstinacy? And surely God will prove stronger than
you.&#8221; He now then fully explains his meaning. By saying, <i>all shall
know, </i>he does not refer to true and sincere knowledge, but to experience,
that is, they shall at length really find out whose word is firm, mine or
theirs.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage deserves special attention; we hence
learn that we ought to acquiesce in God&#8217;s word, and wholly to receive it,
and especially to beware of that diabolical obstinacy which the Prophet here
condemns; for when we fight to the last, we must at the end necessarily fall;
though we may a hundred times complain and clamor, yet God&#8217;s word will
stand firm and will never yield to us. It follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah seals his prophecy by adding a sign which
yet was to be coincident with it. It was not then, as they say, a premonstrative
sign. And doubtless the Jews were wholly unworthy that God should shew them
anything extraordinary; but this sign was only added, that they might know that
they in vain trusted in the protection of Egypt, and also that every excuse
might be taken away.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This brief notice may perhaps be obscure. We shall
therefore refer to a distinction that exists: some signs precede the time and
order of things, but others are connected with the events themselves. The signs
which precede events avail to prepare the minds of the faithful, so that they
may not doubt but that God will do what he has promised, as when Gideon sought a
sign from God, and it was granted to him; the ground was wet with dew, while the
fleece remained dry; and then the fleece remained dry when the ground was wet.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;070636&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Judges
6:36-40.) By this sign Gideon was encouraged to proceed in his course, when
before doubt made him inert<b>.</b> Gideon was torpid, but when he saw by this
miracle that victory would be given him, he boldly undertook the work assigned
to him. The greatest portion of signs are of this kind. But there are other
signs which do not precede events, but shew that when the time is fulfilled the
events have been truly predicted, as when God said to Moses,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;This sign I give
thee, that after ye have come out of Egypt ye shall sacrifice to me in this
mountain.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;020312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Exodus
3:12)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Neither Moses nor the people could know anything by
that sign before they had departed from Egypt. But after they were delivered
they there gave thanks on the third day to God their Redeemer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence signs refer sometimes to past time, and
sometimes to what is future. Those which refer to the future are such as we call
premonstrative, as the case was with Gideon, who took up arms with alacrity,
because he knew that he was fighting under God&#8217;s banner; and he was fully
persuaded of a victory when he understood that God would be his
leader.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This sign then had a reference to what was future.
But the sign given to Moses was retrospective, for the people more clearly saw
that God had <i>been </i>their deliverer, because it had been predicted to Moses
when yet in the desert that the Israelites would come there; and that place,
even Mount Sinai, had been already destined for that worship which afterwards
was presented to God. The people at the time considered this, and by calling to
mind what had been predicted, they were more and more confirmed as to their
faith in God&#8217;s favor. Such was also the sign mentioned here,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This shall be a
sign</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says Jeremiah, even that God would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>deliver -Pharaoh-hophrah into the
hand of Nebuchadnezzar his
enemy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Had any one then asked the Prophet why he spoke of
the king of Egypt, he would have said, &#8220;Now indeed this sign remains as it
were buried, its use is not seen; but God will in due time shew that I have been
entrusted with his commands, for whatever I predict of the king of Egypt shall
be fulfilled.&#8221; This sign was also added, for the thing seemed incredible,
that is, that Egypt could be conquered, which was strongly fortified on every
side. As, then, there was no entrance open for enemies, especially from
Pelusium, the Jews thought that they dwelt, as they say, within the circle of
the moon, and that they were placed beyond the reach of danger. Since, then,
they confided in the protection of Egypt, and thought the land unassailable,
this their confidence was laughed to scorn.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And the Prophet expressly mentions the surname of
Pharaoh, which was Hophra, the meaning of which is not known to me; and it is
probably an Egyptic word, for there is no such word in Hebrew: and it is not
known whence the word Pharaoh has come. We know that all the kings of Egypt had
this name, as the emperors of Rome were called Caesars, in memory of Julius
Caesar. The kings of Egypt were in the same manner called Pharaohs. But each had
his own name to distinguish him from the rest; and this king was called
Hophra.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now what the Prophet <i>predicted, </i>if we believe
<i>Josephus, </i>was fulfilled about the fourth year after they had departed
into Egypt. For Nebuchadnezzar went down again into Egypt, after having spoiled
the Moabites and the Ammonites, and at length took possession of that kingdom.
But it was a hateful message, when Jeremiah predicted the ruin of the kingdom.
Nor is there a doubt, but that danger appeared before his eyes, when he saw that
he addressed ungodly men, who a hundred times wished him to be destroyed. When
therefore he dared to prophesy against the king, the whole people, and the land,
we hence see how great must have been his firmness and his courage, still boldly
to discharge his office; for he was not terrified by danger, but promulgated
whatever God had committed to him. We then have here a singular example of
magnanimity; for the Prophet hesitated not to risk his own life while obeying
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will deliver the king of Egypt
into the hands of his enemies, and of them who seek his
life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he intimates that there would be
fatal enemies, though he speaks only of one enemy, but he connects the army with
its head: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will deliver
-Pharaoh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar,
the king of Babylon, as I have delivered Zedekiah into the hand of his enemy and
of him who sought his life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as though he
had said, &#8220;The condition of the king of Egypt will not be better than that
of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Zedekiah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.&#8221;</i>:
For Zedekiah occupied that sacred throne of which God had testified, &#8220;Here
will I dwell;&#8221; and further, &#8220;On the throne of David shall one of his
posterity ever continue.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence see, that the Prophet reasons from the
greater to the less; for if God had not spared King Zedekiah, who was, as it
were, a sacred person, nothing better could be hoped for as to the king of
Egypt, who reigned only in a manner usual and common. The sum of what is said
then is, that the Jews had been already sufficiently taught by facts how true
his <i>prophecies </i>were; for he had <i>predicted </i>what at length happened
to Zedekiah; but his word was not believed. &#8220;It is now the <i>time,&#8221;
</i>he says, &#8220;when the Jews must know that I am God&#8217;s faithful
servant, as God had added a proof in the <i>case </i>of Zedekiah, which ought to
have remained fixed in their memory.&#8221; Now, if they thought that the king
of Egypt was beyond danger, they ascribed great injustice to God, who had not
delivered Zedekiah, who had been anointed in his name, and by his command. This
then is the import of the passage.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">WE have said that prophetic books were not written by
their authors in the order in which they are now read. But when a Prophet had
preached, and committed to writing a summary of his doctrine, he fixed it to the
doors of the Temple. And there were scribes who collected the summaries, and the
volumes now extant were made from these. I now repeat the same thing, because
some one may wonder that the order of time was not observed by Jeremiah: for
hereafter he will prophesy of heathen nations; and it is certain, that these
prophecies were announced, in part, before the beginning of the reign of
Jehoiakim, some during his reign, and some in the time of Zedekiah. But the
reason I have stated ought to be borne in mind, that this book we have now in
our hands was not written by Jeremiah himself, but that it contains collected
summaries, afterwards formed into one volume.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here is told us a special prophecy concerning Baruch,
who, as we know, was the Prophet&#8217;s scribe, and not only his scribe or
amanuensis, but also his disciple. And here Jeremiah relates, that he was
gravely and severely reproved, because he shewed not a mind sufficiently firm,
when the book mentioned in chapter thirty-six was to be written. Some think that
there was a just reason for his grief, because Jeremiah declared that the ruin
of the city and the people was nigh at hand. They then think that Baruch was
anxious, nay, oppressed with sorrow when he heard that so dreadful a judgment of
God was near; for there is no doubt but that he regarded his country with
becoming devotion, and that he was solicitous concerning the worship of God, and
for the safety of the people whom God had chosen out of all nations, and
adopted. But as we shall hereafter see, he looked rather to himself, and was led
to grief and sorrow on his own account; and for this he was severely reproved by
the Prophet. Others bring forward an explanation by no means satisfactory, that
he coveted the gift of prophecy, when he saw that Jeremiah pronounced, as from
on high, words so weighty, and was the instrument of the Holy Spirit, as though
he <i>exercised </i>a celestial judgment. They <i>hence </i>think that Baruch
was stimulated by a vain desire for the prophetic office, and that he was
reproved because he assumed more than what was right. But this fiction, as I
have already said, has nothing to support it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I do not doubt, therefore, but that he apprehended
danger to himself, because the message which the Prophet had committed to him
was greatly disliked. For we see in the chapter to which I have referred, that
the Prophet did not go to the king, but dictated the contents of the book, and
gave it to Baruch. When, therefore, he saw that he could not discharge his duty
without danger, he began to complain and to murmur; and it was on this account
that the Prophet, by God&#8217;s command, reproved his weakness. The meaning
then is, that Baruch, as he feared for his life, was affected with too much
grief, so that he wished to be freed from all trouble, and that God was offended
with this extreme fear, and gave a command to his Prophet to reprove Baruch, as
he deserved. Let us now come to the words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The word which Jeremiah the prophet
spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah. </i></font><font face="Palatino">We must
notice, that the holy man did not spare his own disciple, whom yet he no doubt
loved; for he had employed him, and Baruch had acted faithfully, not only as his
scribe, but also as his fellow-helper. As then Jeremiah had proved the fidelity,
care, and diligence of Baruch in many things, he wished, no doubt, to treat him
with kindness; but as God would have this fault in Baruch to be corrected, the
Prophet performed this duty that belonged to his office. We hence see that he
forgot flesh and blood, when he had to do his work for God. The circumstance as
to time is added: and hence we may infer what I have already stated, that
Baruch, when in danger of his life, was anxious, and complained of his own case,
as though God had laid on him a burden too heavy and hard to be borne; for the
Prophet says that he received this command
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>when Baruch wrote the words in
the book, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have briefly related how this happened; but it
must be added, that Baruch did not fear without reason, because the king was
already displeased with Jeremiah. He was not indeed altogether cruel, but he had
bad counselors, who were like fans, ready to kindle up his rage; and the issue
proved, that this fear was not without cause; for the king took a penknife and
cut the book in pieces, and then threw it into the fire: and if Jeremiah could
then have been found, no doubt all would have been over with him, as to his
life. But Baruch had been warned by kind men to conceal himself together with
the Prophet. We hence see that Baruch was frightened, because his message was so
disagreeable, and calculated to drive the king to extremities, as it happened.
At the same time, he was too much given to care for himself, for he ought to
have presented his life as a sacrifice to God. For all who are called to such an
office, are in duty bound to undergo all dangers with courage, so as to
disregard life when necessary, or at least to commit it to the care of God; and
when they see dangers nigh, they ought still to proceed in the course of their
office. Though, then, Baruch wished faithfully to serve God, yet in the conflict
he was overcome by temptation, so that he was more anxious for his life than
animated to proceed in his course. It is to this that the time mentioned by the
Prophet refers, when he says, that Baruch was reproved
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>when he wrote the words in a
book</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The prophecy is afterwards more clearly expressed,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith Jehovah of
Baruch.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Prophet sets on him and
accosts him, in order that he might fill his mind with holy fear, in order to
correct that sinful fear, by which he was impeded in strenuously serving God.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast
said</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the cause of the reproof is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>expressed &#8212; thou hast said,
Wo is to me now! for Jehovah has added sorrow to my
grief</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Barnch no doubt wished to
withdraw from his office, as is the case with those who are too much pressed,
when they find that they are unequal to their task; they seek hiding-places and
become runagates. Such, then, was the feeling of Baruch when he said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wo is to me now!
</i></font><font face="Palatino">It was highly honorable to be a scribe to a
Prophet, for it was the same thing as though he received words from the mouth of
an angel. It was then unworthy and disgraceful for the holy servant of God to
complain of his own misery, when yet it was an evidence of singular favor, that
God had been pleased to choose him for such an office. Here then the ingratitude
of Baruch is condemned, when he exclaimed that he was miserable, while yet he
ought to have deemed it a singular happiness, that God had called him to that
work.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah has added sorrow to my
grief</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here the ingratitude of Baruch
breaks out still more; for he ex-postulated with God, as though he had said,
that he was not kindly treated. And there is an implied reproach in this
complaint; for it is the same thing as though he called in question God&#8217;s
justice, and charged him with too much severity. At the same time he complains
that there was no end, as though he had said, that he had already suffered too
much, and that God was not acting kindly with him, because he added evils to
evils,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>has added sorrow to
my grief</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It seems that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wgy</font><font face="Palatino">,
igun, is more than
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bakm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mecab, </i>for Baruch intimates that he had already suffered <i>grief
</i>there being an occasion for it; but that now an addition of <i>sorrow </i>or
mourning was made to so many griefs.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence conclude, that Baruch did not shrink
immediately at the first conflict, as slothful men do; but that he vacillated in
the middle of his course. And this ought to be carefully observed; for they who
have once courageously performed their office, think themselves endued as with
angelic fortitude. Hence it comes that they boldly disregard all dangers,
because they believe themselves to be invincible. But we see that Baruch was for
a time a strenuous and courageous servant of God; but when there appeared no
end, he began to grow faint. Let us then learn constantly to flee to God and to
seek of him a new increase of grace, so that he may sustain us by the power of
his Spirit, and raise us up, when fallen, for otherwise we cannot but fall every
moment, even when our career seems glorious; but let us learn, being mindful of
our infirmities, to ask the Lord to hold us up and to stretch forth his hand to
us every day. This is what we are to observe in the example of Baruch, when he
says, that sorrow was added to his grief.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he afterwards expresses the same thing more
clearly; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have labored in my
groaning</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and found no
rest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By these words also, he testifies
that he had been exposed to various evils, that his troubles were not as yet
alleviated, or that he was not freed from dangers, and that at length he
succumbed, for no rest was given him. We hence see what I have already stated,
that Baruch was not refractory immediately at starting, but that when he had
already made progress, having completed a part of the race, he was overcome with
trials and overwhelmed, before he reached the goal.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus shalt thou say to
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. Here the Prophet shews that he
was not roused against Baruch through any private displeasure, but that he had
only conveyed to him God&#8217;s message.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, what I have built I pull
down</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and what I have planted <i>I root
up. </i>Here it is evident that the cause of the reproof was, that Baruch loved
himself too much, and wished to evade dangers when God ordered him to engage in
the conflict. Jeremiah sets forth what would be to the whole people. The
comparison shews what I have stated, that Baruch, disregarding the public
safety, was too cautious, and was thus timid and tender as to his own life. This
is the reason why God mentions the whole people, as though he had said,
&#8220;Dost thou wish to be deemed of more importance than the whole people? Is
thy life of more value than the wellbeing of the whole community?&#8221; It was
a disgrace to Baruch to prefer himself to the whole people, and even to the
Temple and the worship of God. When, therefore, the severity of God was now
ready to fall on the whole people, though Baruch might have endangered his life
a hundred times, yet he ought not to have made so much account of his life. Then
the Prophet shews here that Baruch was too delicate as to himself; and because
he was blinded by the love of himself, he did not consider the public safety of
the people, nor did he regard the Temple and the holy land.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These metaphors of building and planting often occur
in Scripture, I shall not therefore dwell on them here. But we must observe,
that though God be the creator of the whole world, yet the people of Israel were
peculiarly his work, and also the land of Israel. For God had consecrated that
land to himself that he might be served in it, and had adopted the people. Hence
he often <i>compares </i>that people to a vineyard.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;O my vineyard, I
have planted
thee.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240221&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah

<div><font face="Palatino">I will not multiply quotations, for in a thing so
<i>easy </i>it would be a foolish ostentation to heap together many texts. God,
then, had built his people, because they dwelt there as in their own
habitations, and the land was called his rest<b>.</b> He had also planted his
people. We may remark, in short, that the building mentioned here and also the
plantation, refer to those special favors which God had bestowed on that people.
For though he had planted the whole world and all nations, yet the people of
Israel was especially his planting, as it is said by Isaiah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The planting of

<div><font face="Palatino">that is, this people had been planted, that God

<div><font face="Palatino">Let us come now to what is here declared; he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I pull down what I have built, I
root up what I have planted</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as though
he had said, &#8220;I have hitherto adorned this people with singular
endowments; for I chose them as a heritage to myself, it is a holy race, it is a
priestly kingdom, I dwell in the midst of them, I have undertaken the care of
defending them, I am their Father, they are to me not only as a son, but also as
a first-born; and titan this land is holy, because I have set my name in it: I
have therefore built and planted this people and this land; but now, he says, I
am pulling down and rooting up.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It afterwards follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And seekest thou great things for
thyself? </i></font><font face="Palatino">We now see clear enough why he
reproved Baruch, it was, because he was too careful as to himself, and too
timid; and thus it was that he was impeded in his duty. He then says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And dost thou seek for
thyself?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;l</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
lac, </i>for thyself, is put here emphatically; for here God sets Baruch in the
balance, and the whole people together, with the temple and divine worship.
<i>&#8220;Dost thou,&#8221; </i>he says, <i>&#8220;outweigh </i>them? Is thy
life of more value than the temple, the safety of the people, and all my gifts
which so much excel?&#8221; It was then God&#8217;s purpose in this way to make
Baruch ashamed of himself, because he preferred a frail life to so many things
and so glorious. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Dost
thou,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>then, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seek great
things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twldg</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
gidalut, for thyself? </i>that is, <i>&#8220;Shall </i>thy state be eminent
while the temple is burnt with fire, while the land is laid waste, while most
men perish, and the remnant are driven into exile and captivity? Art thou then
alone to be deemed sacred? Art thou alone to be exempt from loss and trouble?
See, is all this right?&#8221; Here then he made Baruch himself the
judge.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as Baruch might as yet flatter himself, he
immediately restrains him; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Seek
not,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he says, for we know how men from
self-love seek their own indulgence. That Baruch then might not persist in his
course, God puts a <i>check </i>on all his ambitious feelings;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Seek
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says. He afterwards adds a
ground of consolation. Baruch has been thus far severely reproved, as he
deserved, on account of his self-indulgence; but God now forgives him, and adds
a comfort which might in part alleviate his sorrow;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For
behold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will bring evil on all
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and 1 will give thee thy life
for a prey in all p1aces whither thou goest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Here God frees Baruch from that distressing fear by which he had been
debilitated, so as not to possess suitable firmness for his work. he then says,
&#8220;Fear not, for thy life shall be safe to thee while all around thee are
destroyed.&#8221; Baruch thought that he should perish while the people were
safe and secure; but God declares that none of the people would be safe, and
that he would be safely preserved while all the rest were
perishing.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will bring
evil</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on all
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He speaks indeed briefly, but
Baruch must have well considered what he had received from the mouth of the
Prophet, for he ought to have been fully persuaded as to the faithfulness and
immutable purpose of God. God then assumes this fact, that ruin was nigh as to
the whole people and other nations. He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy life will I give thee as a
prey</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Of this kind of language we have
before spoken. To give one his life for a prey was to deliver him as it were
from instant death. As when all things are exposed to plunder, if one snatched
this or that and escaped, he would have something saved; or as if one plucked
anything from the burning, he would have it preserved; so when all things were
thrown into such a confusion, that death would beset men on every side, he who
could escape in safety would have his life as a prey when removed from all
danger. Then God bids Baruch to be content with the benefit of being safe, while
others, as I have said, were perishing. Now follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah begins here to prophesy against foreign
nations, and continues to do so to the last chapter but one, not that he then
for the first time began to announce these oracles, but as I have already said,
a volume was at length formed, including his prophecies, the order of time being
not everywhere observed; for we see in the 25th chapter that he threatened
heathen nations with the punishments they had deserved before Jehoiakim was made
king. But as I have said, the prophecies respecting heathen nations have been
separated, though as to time Jeremiah had predicted what afterwards
happened.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">he then says that he had prophesied of the
destruction of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Egyptian
army</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which King Nebuchadnezzar overthrew
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the fourth year of
Jehoiakim</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Jeremiah had then foretold
before this time what was to be. It might have been that before Pharaoh-necho
prepared his army, Jeremiah predicted what would take place; but it is probable
that this prophecy was announced at the time when Pharaoh-necho went forth
against the Chaldeans, for he was fighting then for the Assyrians. As they were
not equal to the Chaldeans they made a treaty with the Egyptians. They then had
come for a subsidy to drive away the Babylonians, and thus to defend the
Assyrians against their forces. But at first the expedition met with success;
yet at last what had been predicted by the Prophet was
fulfilled.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is not known whether or not the design was to
alleviate the sorrow of the people by this prophecy; and yet I am disposed to
receive what the greater part of interpreters have held, that as at that time
the people were in the greatest trouble, this prophecy was given in order that
the faithful might know that God had not ceased to care for his people. But we
must especially attend to the truth of history, for when Pharaoh-necho was
induced, as it has been said, by the Assyrians, to lead his army to the
Euphrates, the pious king Josiah met him, and he was then a confederate with the
Babylonians, because there had been a friendly intercourse between the Chaldeans
and the Jews since the reign of Hezekiah. As then Josiah wished to render
service to a king who was his friend, he opposed the army of Pharaoh; but he was
conquered and slain. Now the expedition of Pharaoh was fortunate and successful
for a time, but when he began to boast of victory he was suddenly cast down; for
King Nebuchadnezzar not only checked his audacity, but having routed his army,
compelled him to return into Egypt, and occupied the whole country from the
Euphrates to Palusium. That country had not yet been exposed to those continual
changes which afterwards happened, that is, when those robbers who had succeeded
Alexander the Great boasted that they were the kings of kings, and when every
one strove to draw all things to himself. For hence it happened that now
Egyptian kings, and then Asiatic kings, often shook that land as far as they
could. This had not yet happened when Jeremiah prophesied, nor had Alexander
been yet born, but it yet appears that these regions were even then subject to
changes, so that there was nothing fixed or permanent connected with them. We
must then bear in mind that the events of wars were dubious, so that, one while,
the Egyptians forcibly seized a portion of Asia, and at another time the
Assyrians diminished their power, and again the Chaldeans. Pharaoh-necho was
then so repulsed that he never dared again to come forth, as sacred history
testifies in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;122407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 24:7.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now come to the Prophecy of Jeremiah. He says
that he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophesied against the
army of Pharaoh-necho, when it was at
Euphrates</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is when he fought there
and thought that he would be a conqueror, as he had far and wide desolated a
hostile land, and brought under his authority many cities. When therefore he had
met with great successes, Jeremiah was then bidden to prophesy against his army,
so that the Jews might know that the death of pious Josiah would not go
unpunished, because God had purposed to destroy that great army by which Josiah
had been killed, and so to break down and lay prostrate the power of Egypt, that
King Pharaoh would hereafter remain as shut up in prison as it afterwards
happened. The rest to-morrow.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">JEREMIAH uses now a form of speaking very common in
the Prophets though remote from common use. For the Prophets, when they denounce
God&#8217;s judgments and punishments on the ungodly, do not speak in a simple
language, as though they were giving a narrative, but they employed figurative
expressions, as though they wished to introduce men into the very scene itself.
And that their doctrine might more effectually penetrate into the hearts of men,
they bring forward various persons; they at one time introduce God as speaking,
and at another they pronounce this or that according to the sentiments of
others; and again, they declare the commands of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah begins here by summoning the Egyptians, as
though he were the herald of Pharaoh, and thus borrows the name of another
person. He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Prepare</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#730;r[</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Prepare</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the buckler and the
shield</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The word

<i>tsane, </i>was a shield of a larger form, and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;gm</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>megen, </i>seems to have been a buckler carried by horsemen of light armor.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And come near to
battle</i></font><font face="Palatino">: He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Bind</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>or he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
horses</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The manner of fighting is not
the same now as it was formerly; they fought in chariots, as heathen authors
abundantly shew. He therefore says,
he</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> the
horses</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, join them together that
they may draw the chariots. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go
up, ye horsemen, stand in your helmets, clean your lances, and put on your coats
of mail.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The meaning is, that Egyptians
would come well prepared with all kinds of arms that they might be formidable to
their enemies. And hence the vengeance appeared more clearly, because they had
been well furnished, so that they might seem to have gained the victory before
they engaged with their enemies. This is the reason why the Prophet enumerates
their complete armor, having omitted no material part; he mentions
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the lances, the helmets, the
coats of mail, the chariots, the horses</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
shield</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>so that victory, according to
the judgment of men, was already theirs. This is the first
thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must observe the design of the Holy Spirit; it
was his purpose to remove the veil from the eyes of the faithful, which for the
most part prevents us to see as clearly as we ought the power of God; for when
we fix our attention on warlike preparations, we do not think that anything is
left for God to do; for they who are well prepared seem to be beyond the hazard
of losing the day. That the Jews then might know that it would be nothing for
God to punish the Egyptians, he records this preparation. And there is a kind of
concession when he says, They shall indeed be furnished with a helmet, a coat of
mail, a shield, a sword, and a lance; but all this would avail nothing as to the
issue. Then from this prophetic word let us learn, that God makes no account of
all those things which men prepare when they wish to <i>effect </i>anything. For
smoke is everything that dazzles our eyes; so forces and arms have no importance
before God; for by a single blast he can dissipate all such clouds. And this
truth is very useful; for we look on external things, and when anything specious
presents itself to us, we are immediately taken up with it, and rob God of all
power; for we transfer his glory to these masks which appear before us. We now
then understand why the Prophet speaks here of bucklers, and shields, and
lances, and chariots, and helmets, and coats of mail.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For it immediately follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>or how, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>have I seen them
broken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>Here the Prophet, on the other
hand, disregards all the things which he before enumerated in such high terms,
for he spoke, as it were, according to the common judgment of men. And, as I
have said, he undertook the person of a herald, as though Pharaoh himself had
commanded the Egyptians immediately to take up arms. This then was apparently
very formidable. But the Prophet now speaks as though standing on an eminence,
and says, How or what is this? for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[wdm</font><font face="Palatino">,
m<i>eduo, </i>is a particle of wonder, How! He then passes over from the common
opinion of the flesh to the prophetic Spirit, as though he had said, &#8220;Were
any one to judge of the Egyptians by their external splen-dour, he would say
that they would be victorious over their enemies; but were any one to ascend
higher and to form a judgment, not according to the flesh, but according to the
spirit, he would see that all this is frail and
evanescent.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the question, <i>How? </i>is to be taken as
emphatical; for it could have been hardly believed that an army so well equipped
could have become a prey to the Babylonians, and that it was hastening to its
own ruin. As then this seemed incredible to any one attending to the subject,
the Prophet asks, How have I seen them? He however says that he <i>saw </i>them,
even because God had set him, as we have said, as it were on a watch-tower.
This, however, may be applied to the body as well as to the mind.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I saw them turned
backward</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:, </i>when yet they were rushing
forward, as he says afterwards, like a flood.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their
valiant</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>men, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>have been smitten, and by flight
they have fled.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He means, in short, that there
would not be so much courage in the Egyptians as to withstand the onset of their
enemies, because they would be broken down by the hidden power of God. He also
adds, that their flight would be accompanied with so much dread, that they would
not dare to look behind, so that their danger would increase their
haste.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He at length adds in God&#8217;s name,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Terror on every side, says
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here he changes the person the
third time, for he declares as from God&#8217;s mouth that there would be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>terror on every
side</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and thus it is an answer to the
question, How, or why? even because God, he says, executes his judgment on them.
Whenever, therefore, we see that nothing is wanting to our enemies for victory
even over the Church of God, let what the Prophet says here be remembered by us,
that there is no reason why we should despond, though we may be filled with
wonder and amazement; for God will so work as to break down, without the hand of
man, those who shake the whole world with terror. It afterwards follows, &#8212;

must yet perish, when that is God&#8217;s will: flight cannot save the swift,

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet again meets those doubts which might have
possessed the minds of the godly, so as to prevent them to receive this prophecy
in faith and with due reverence: for we have said, that when our thoughts are
occupied with external things, the power of God is disregarded. When, therefore,
we speak of some impregnable kingdom, it does not come into our minds, that all
strongholds are of no account with God. It was therefore necessary highly to
extol the power of God, when the Prophets spoke of his judgments: otherwise the
flesh, as we have stated, would have said, &#8220;They who are well fortified
must be free from evils, and as it were beyond the reach of weapons, and hence
there is nothing for them to fear.&#8221; And it is with this false imagination
that the proud deceive themselves, for they set up their forces, their
auxiliaries, and all the things which they deem, according to the judgment of
the flesh, as sufficient to protect their safety. Titus it happens, that they
heedlessly disregard all threatenings, even because they think that the
subsidies which they have are so many fortresses against all
attacks.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is for this purpose that the Prophet now says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is this that as a lake
rises</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or swells,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as rivers are
moved</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whose waters
</i></font><font face="Palatino">are agitated? But he speaks according to the
common judgment of men, for the very sight could not but fill men with fear; and
so the Jews could never have thought that possible which the Prophet here
asserts. He then, as it were, introduces them all as anxiously inquiring
according to their own judgment,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is
this</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>as though Pharaoh was not a
mortal, but something above human. For the drift of the question is this, that
Pharaoh was as it were exempted from the common condition of men, because his
power increased like a river rising or swelling; and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>its
waters</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>make a

<div><font face="Palatino">Then he adds,

it made a noise with its forces, as though a river were rolling along its

<div><font face="Palatino">He goes on with the same subject, and enumerates
whatever might discredit his prophecy. For when the faithful saw that the
Egyptians went on that expedition not only with immense forces, but had also, as
foreign aids, the Ethiopians and the Libyans, and even transmarine soldiers from
Lydia, &#8212; when they saw hired soldiers from all parts joined to the
Egyptians, it was hardly credible that such an army could be put to flight. Then
the Prophet says here, that though Pharaoh hired the Ethiopians, the Libyans,
and the Lydians, yet with all these forces he would perish.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He again speaks in the name of Pharaoh,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ascend,
ye</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>horses;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>toss, ye chariots, and let the
valiant come forth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This coming forth
may refer to the lands whence they came. He mentions first the Ethiopians, who
were near the Egyptians, though separated from them. Then he adds the people of
Libya, who were Africans, or who were in the middle between Egypt and Africa.
Then he says, that they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>laid hold
on the shield.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He points out their
principal armor, not that they were without a helmet and sword and other arms,
but they mainly trusted in their shields. As we know that the Macedonians wore
the <i>pelta, </i>and were remarkable for that piece of armor, so the Prophet
says that the Ethiopians and Libyans were furnished with bucklers or shields. He
mentions also the Lydians, who were from another part, even from the opposite
shore of the sea; for we know that the Lydians were in Asia Minor, while the
Egyptians were in the middle between Africa and Judea. The Mediterranean Sea was
therefore between them. It hence appears, that auxiliaries from a distance, and
with great expense, were procured by Pharaoh when he undertook this war. And it
is also probable that other nations were hired; but the Prophet mentions only
the Ethiopians, Libyans, and Lydians: and he says, that those named last <i>laid
hold on the bow, </i>because they were the best archers. It now follows, &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet having described the terrible forces of
Pharaoh, in which he so trusted, that he dared to boast of a certain victory,
now says that the event would be very different:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But this day, he says, will be
the day of Jehovah&#8217;s vengeance;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as
though he had said, that Pharaoh would look only on his chariots and horsemen,
his hired soldiers, their arms and warlike preparations, and that he would not
at the same time look to God, who is not without reason called the God of hosts.
Though the Scripture in many places ascribes this title to God, yet here it has
a special application. For the Prophet derides the folly of Pharaoh, because he
thought the issue of the war was in his own hand, as though the over-ruling of
all things was not in God&#8217;s hand. He then says, that victory depended on
God only; and farther, he announces what was to be:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This
day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will be the day of God&#8217;s
vengeance.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By these words he intimates that God was incensed
with the Egyptians, and the cause we referred to yesterday, even because
Pharaoh-necho had in passing through slain the pious King Josiah. He then
deserved that God should lay prostrate his arrogance, and also chastise his
cruelty and check his tyranny. But when he calls the Egyptians God&#8217;s
<i>adversaries, </i>this was said for the consolation of the chosen people, to
shew that God would undertake their cause. For whence was it that he was an
enemy to the Egyptians? even because he would not suffer the pious king to be
killed with impunity. We now then understand what these words mean, that <i>this
day </i>would be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a day of
vengeance </i></font><font face="Palatino">to the God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of
hosts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as though he had said, that God
would preside over and regulate that war, so that all the forces of Pharaoh
would avail him nothing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">he afterwards expresses more clearly, for
confirmation, what he had said:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
sword</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall devour, and shall be
satiated and made drunk with their blood</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>But at the end of the verse he says, that this would be the righteous
judgment of God. For God so extols his own power, that he yet would have himself
acknowledged to be just whenever he inflicts punishment on the ungodly; for as
his severity often appears extreme, hence the Prophets, when they speak of acts
of vengeance which God executes, at the same time adds some testimony as to his
judgment being righteous, as in this place, when it is said, that the God of
hosts had </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a
sacrifice</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By <i>sacrifice </i>the Prophet means, that the
slaughter would be free from every stain; for it is the same thing as though he
had said, &#8220;God will be glorified in that slaughter, when all the Egyptians
shall be destroyed.&#8221; For why do we offer sacrifices to God except that his
glory may be proclaimed, that he is just as well as merciful, and almighty, and
the fountain of all wisdom and uprightness? We hence see the purpose for which
the word sacrifice is used, even that none should dare to blame that slaughter,
as though God were too rigid and exceeded the limits of justice in shedding that
blood. He then says that all the slaughters would be as so many sacrifices, in
which God&#8217;s justice as well as his power would shine forth, he again
points out the place, the land of the north, nigh Euphrates, in order that more
credit and certainty might be given to the prophecy. It now follows, &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet adds here nothing new, but confirms by
an-. other metaphor what he had said before. He then says, that the slaughter
would be like a fatal plague, as though God would take away from the Egyptians
every hope. We indeed know that the kingdom of Egypt did not then perish; for
the nation itself remained. But the kingdom was so depressed, that, as it was
stated yesterday, they kept themselves as shut up within their own borders, and
did not afterwards bring out their forces. And yet it is well known how great
was the pride and audacity of that nation; but they saw that they were wholly
broken down and weakened. Hence the Prophet says, not without reason, that that
would be an incurable wound, by which God would so smite Egypt, that it would no
more recover its ancient strength; for after that time the kingdom of Egypt
never flourished; and after a few years, as we shall see in another prophecy, it
was brought under the power of Babylon.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">he now turns his discourse to Egypt: he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O virgin, the daughter of
Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, a </i>mode of speaking common in the
Prophets. They call Babylon, The daughter of Babylon; they call Judea, The
daughter of Judah. But this may be applied to the people or to the kingdom. And
he calls Egypt <i>virgin </i>on account of its
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>delicacies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>as though he had said, that the Egyptians were tender and delicate, because
they had during a long peace gathered strength and all kinds of wealth. As then
they were so inebriated with their pleasures, Egypt by way of mockery is called
a virgin.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ascend</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>into Gilead, and
take rosin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, as some render it,
&#8220;balm.&#8221; Jerome, in another place, rendered it &#8220;honey,&#8221;
but without reason; and it is probable that the word means rosin rather than
balm. It may be also concluded from other places that the best rosin was found
on Mount Gilead, as we have also stated in the eighth chapter of this book
(Jeremiah 8). The rosin was a juice flowing from trees, especially from the
terebinth; and hence the best rosin is the terebinthine, which we call
<i>terebenthine. </i>There is at the same time a rosin from firs and other
trees. But as I have already said, Mount Gilead was fruitful in rosin, and is
celebrated not only for the abundance of its rosin but also for its excellency;
and its medicinal qualities are found better and more efficacious in some places
than in others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">According, then, to the common mode of speaking, he
says</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, O daughter of Egypt, ascend
into Gilead, and take to thee rosin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but
it will be, he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in
vain;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, <i>&#8220;Wert </i>thou
earnestly to seek a remedy for thy evils, thou couldst never find it; for thy
stroke is incurable.&#8221; Not that the kingdom of Egypt perished or was wholly
overthrown, but that its strength would be lost, so that the Chaldean king would
take possession of all that part of Asia which the Egyptians had occupied, even
as far as Pelusium, to the very borders of the Nile. He at length adds, &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">He concludes this prophecy by saying that the report
of this slaughter would be everywhere known among all nations. Had the Egyptians
sustained only a small loss, the thing might have been unknown, as when a small
engagement takes place the report does not spread far and wide; but when by one
battle a nation is so conquered that a remarkable change follows, the event then
is proclaimed everywhere. The Prophet then intimates by these words, that the
stroke of Egypt would not be common, as also he said before, because the report
would fly through all nations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Heard</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>have all nations of thy
reproach</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>even that the Egyptians had,
to their great disgrace, been conquered by the Chaldeans, and that they had not
only been put to flight, but that the greatest part of them had been slain, so
that the kingdom of Egypt had been nearly lost; that at least they had been
reduced to such straits, that they lost their chief eries and a very wide
country, even throughout Asia to the river Euphrates.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the land was filled with their
cry</i></font><font face="Palatino">: by voice or cry he means lamentations.
Then he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because the valiant
hath stumbled against the valiant</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This
may be thus explained, &#8220;The valiant hath contended with the
valiant;&#8221; but. that the Chaldean proved stronger than the Egyptian: but I
prefer to apply this to the Egyptians; and this may be inferred from the end of
the verse, where he says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>both
fell.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>So the Prophet means that the
multitude, in which the Egyptians gloried, would be a hindrance to them, as
usually is the case, when the army is too crowded, for the larger and the more
numerous the army is, the greater is the disorder and confusion. When an army is
small, they can by degrees recede, or stand still, until they take flight in
safety: but in a great multitude there is also great trepidation, and hence a
great disorder and confusion. This then is what the Prophet points out, when he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The valiant stumbled
against the valiant, and they both fell
together</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, that while they were
fighting, they would clash with one another, and produce such disorder, as to
occasion the fall of both.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The former prophecy was respecting the slaughter of
the Egyptian army, when Pharaoh came to assist the Assyrians, with whom he was
then confederate. But this prophecy extends farther; for Jeremiah declares that
the Egyptians themselves would have their turn; for we know even from other
Prophets, that punishment had been denounced on them, (and Ezekiel pursues this
subject through many chapters,) because they had, by their allurements, deceived
the people of God. And God punished them not only for the evils by which they
had themselves provoked his wrath, but because they had corrupted the Jews and
confirmed them more and more in their obstinacy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then perceive the design of the Prophet: the
meaning is, that God, after having executed his judgment on the Israelites and
the Jews, would become also the judge of the Egyptians and of other nations. We
must further observe, that this prophecy was announced before the city was
taken. At the time, then, that the Egyptians were secure, and that the Jews,
relying on their aid, thought themselves safe from the violence of
Nebuchadnezzar, it was then that this prophecy was delivered. But we see again,
that the order of time is not observed as to these prophecies; for he had spoken
of the slaughter of the army, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim. And it is
probable, though the time is not pointed out here, that the destruction of Egypt
had then been predicted; for before Jeremiah began to discharge his prophetic
office, Isaiah had spoken against Egypt. Ezekiel, also, when an exile in
Chaldea, at the same time confirmed the prophecies of Jeremiah, and said many
more things against Egypt. We must however remark, that Jeremiah had not once
only prophesied of the ruin of Egypt; for after he was forcibly led there, he
confirmed, as we have before seen, what he had said previously.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah then had predicted what we read here many

<div><font face="Palatino">He pursues the same mode of speaking as we observed
yesterday; and the reason was explained, even because, as men are very
inattentive to God&#8217;s judgments, the message of Jeremiah would have been
<i>ineffectual, </i>had he spoken plainly, and in an ordinary way. It was
therefore necessary to adopt an elevated style, and to speak, as he does, in a
manner striking and forcible. Public speakers affect fine speaking, but only to
catch applause, or to fill men with empty fear or joy: but the Prophets had in
view another thing, even to teach, to exhort, to reprove, to threaten, in a way
calculated to be effectual.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Declare ye in
Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as though he pronounced a
sentence from a tribunal, being endowed with divine authority. He then bids this
message to be brought to the Egyptians. He afterwards mentions some cities,
<i>Migdol, Noph, </i>and <i>Tahpanhes. </i>Some think Noph to be Alexandria; but
it was probably Memphis, and this appears evident from other parts of Scripture.
But they are mistaken who think that the same was Migdol, for the Prophet here
refers to them as different places. Of Tahpanhes we have spoken elsewhere. Now
these were celebrated cities and known to the Jews, as they were not far from
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We know that Memphis was a renowned city; but this
was much more known to the Israelites, for it was not far from their passage
from Egypt, as we may learn from the second book of Moses and other parts of
Scripture. Then we have seen that the <i>Jews </i>dwelt in Tahpanhes when they
became fugitives from their own land, and were <i>received </i>there as
guests.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is then the same as though the Prophet had said,
that God was now armed against the Egyptians; but as he was not a teacher set
over them, he speaks of them as of foreign nations,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Declare</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Say, Stand, and prepare thyself,
for the sword has devoured thy borders</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and everything around thee. By these words the Prophet intimates, that
though the Egyptians, being warned in due time, should exercise vigilance, yet
their care would be useless, for they could not prevent God from executing what
he had determined, he speaks, however, of what was incredible, for the Egyptians
thought themselves far from every danger: hence the Prophet says, that how much
so ever they might prepare themselves, yet it would all be in vain. He then
derides their security, because they thought themselves beyond the reach of
danger. It follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">By these words the Prophet expresses more clearly
what I have just referred to, that the Egyptians would not be able to resist,
though they might have gathered auxiliaries on every side, because God would
carry on war against them. In astonishment he asks, &#8220;How has it happened,
or, how is it, that thy </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>valiant
men have been thus scattered</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?&#8221; </i>The
verb, indeed, means to sweep, but here it means to scatter. He immediately
answers, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because God has driven
them, they could not stand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The reason
for such a question we explained yesterday, even because the unbelieving
regarded as a fable whatever they heard from the Prophets; and as long as things
went on prosperously, they slept, in a manner, over their good fortune, and
became inebriated with it, so that they feared nothing, and did not think
themselves exposed to any adversities. As then ungodly men proudly disregarded
God, the Prophets, appealing to common sense, asked them,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How comes
this?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>For Jeremiah spoke of things as
yet hidden, and which had not fallen under the observation of men. We hence see
why this wonder was expressed,

referred to yesterday, that ungodly men deceive themselves by a false
confidence, when they set up in opposition to God&#8217;s power their earthly
helps and subsidies, and think that they are well secured when they possess many
forces and strongholds, and when they can procure auxiliaries for themselves
from every quarter. Let us know that nothing is more fatal than to confide in
earthly helps, when God declares that he is our adversary. Hence the Prophet
says, that they did not stand,

them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as though he had said, that
Egyptians would have to do not only with the king of Babylon, but with God

God, then, has <i>multiplied. </i>And then there is a change of number, for the

<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,

Some think that the reference is to foreigners, who had come into Egypt on
account of the fruitfulness of the land; for a dwelling in Egypt, which we know
was very fertile and full of all abundance, was especially advantageous to them.
As, then, Egypt had in it many strangers and sojourners, some interpreters think
that the Prophet here speaks of them, as though he had said, &#8220;They who
came into Egypt, to live well there through the affluence of all good things,
shall find nothing better for them than to flee away:&#8221;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They

&#8220;Let us be satisfied with our own native soil; for the very richness of
Egypt will prove fatal to us if we remain in it.&#8221; But I rather think that
the Prophet refers to the hired soldiers. We saw yesterday that when Pharaoh
carried on war on the banks of Euphrates, he had with him Ethiopians, and
Lydians, and many from Libya, and we shall see again presently that there were
hired soldiers in Egypt when Nebuchadnezzar conquered it. It was then very
suitable for the Prophet to mention these foreign soldiers whom Pharaoh had
hired; for at the beginning of the verse he said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every one shall stumble on his
neighbor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and then it follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall say, Let us return
to our own people and to the land of our
nativity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>When he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every one shall stumble on his
neighbor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he means, no doubt, those
valiant men, called to defend Egypt; of the same also he speaks when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rise, let us return to the land
of our nativity.</i></font><br></div>

inebriated with much blood, and which had done many slaughters. By the sword, he
means that of the soldiers of Nebuchadnezzar. Some render the words,
&#8220;saddening sword,&#8221; but this rendering appears to me unmeaning. They
then say, &#8220;As we have been already broken down, and see our enemies

<div><font face="Palatino">This verse ought to be joined with the preceding, for
he refers to the cries of the soldiers who had been deceived by their own hopes:
they at length </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cried, Pharaoh is
to us a king of confusion.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Prophet
predicts what was to be; but he speaks, according to what was usually done, in
the past time; for the Prophets announce unknown things as before their eyes, in
order to gain credit to their prophecies. He then says, that there would be a
cry among the soldiers, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pharaoh
the king of Egypt is a king of confusion;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>for the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wa&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shaun, </i>is to be read in the genitive case; as though the Prophet had said
that the soldiers would really find that Pharaoh would not turn out according to
his boasting. The name of Egypt first filled him and the whole nation with
arrogance; and further, it was dreaded by the neighbouring nations. When,
therefore, they <i>came </i>to Pharaoh, they thought that they were coming to
some sort of a god. The Prophet derided that foolish confidence unreasonably
entertained, and says, <i>&#8220;They </i>shall cry there, O Pharaoh,
magnificent king, thou art now a king of tumult,&#8221; or
confusion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What follows is not well explained, as I think, by
interpreters; for they all, with one consent, think that Pharaoh is derided,
because he delayed time, after having before said that he would go against
Nebuchadnezzar; as earthly kings, when they think themselves sufficiently
prepared, do not wait until the enemy is at hand, or finds them at home, but go
to meet him at a distance. Others think that the time for war had been
proclaimed, as it was usual formerly for both sides to proclaim a certain day on
which they were to <i>come </i>to a conflict. But from the last verse we may
gather that the Prophet meant another thing, he then derides, if I am not
mistaken, the folly of Pharaoh for another reason, even because he thought that
those threatenings were vain and empty, which had been dispersed by the Jews;
for the Egyptians were not ignorant of what had been predicted by the Prophets.
Isaiah had long before cried out against the Jews, because they made treaties
with the Egyptians, and fled there for aid. There is no doubt but the courtiers,
in order to gain favor, said to them, &#8220;Behold, our Prophets hinder us as
much as they can, and we must take care lest they turn aside the people: while
then there is time, let us make the treaty, which will be useful to you as well
as to us.&#8221; As, then, the destruction of Egypt had been predicted many
years before, and as the Egyptians remained in safety after Judea was overthrown
and laid waste, it is probable that they became more hardened, thinking that the
time had elapsed. And this view, as I have said, is confirmed by the context.

greatness in opposition to the power of Pharaoh and of all other kings; for
prosperity commonly brings pride with it, and those who excel in dignity and
power become self-willed and insolent. Hence to repress this haughty insolence,
he says, that the name of King, the God of hosts, belongs not properly to any

not suitable who say, &#8220;As wild beasts fleeing from hunters, pass over from
neighboring mountains to Mount Tabor, and as trees cut on Carmel are carried to
the sea.&#8221; This is an extremely forced explanation, and cannot be adapted
to the present passage. For what is the design of the Prophet? even to shew that
what he had just declared would be immutable, and so fixed that it could not be
reversed, that though the whole world attempted to frustrate what God had
decreed, yet nothing could be done. Then he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As Tabor is in the

understood by the Jews to have been that mount where Nabal dwelt, but a mountain

sea.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Tabor as well as Carmel remain
fixed, and cannot be transferred to another place; so he says, shall this

was a very celebrated city and a royal residence. He says that it would be laid
waste, and yet we know that the Pyramids there were reckoned among the wonders
of the world. The city was populous, and had many advantages. The Prophet dooms
it to desolation. If, then, such solitude awaited the most celebrated city, what
was to become of the smaller towns? what was to become of the villages? We now,
then, see what was the purpose of the Prophet, even to shew, that when
Nebuchadnezzar made an irruption into Egypt, all things would be under his
power, so that he would, at his pleasure, seize on, plunder, and lay waste the
whole land. It now follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah intimates here, that though Egypt indulged
in pleasures, it could not yet escape the vengeance of God. We reminded you
yesterday why the Prophets mentioned the wealth, the riches, and the power of
the ungodly, even because they are blinded by all the good things in which they
abound; for they fear nothing, nor feel any anxiety, but through a false notion
they exempt themselves from every evil. As, then, the unbelieving are thus
presumptuous and proud, the Prophets, on the other hand, warn them and say, that
however they may exult in their own strength and defenses, <i>they </i>would
yet, when it pleased God to make them prey, become the most miserable of
all.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet represents the mercenaries of Egypt,
as we have already said, as being foreign soldiers, who had been hired here and
there, and from far countries, such as Lydia was. It may yet have been, that
there were not many at that time who had come from beyond the sea to the
Egyptians; but they had the Ethiopians, for Ezekiel says that many came from
Cush, that is, Ethiopia; and then they had some from Libya and the neighboring
countries. Then Jeremiah includes them under one name, and says that they were
<i>mercenaries. </i>Now, they who hire themselves seem to be more warlike than
others; for they who defend their own country do this from necessity; but those
who of themselves seek war, and depart from their own borders for the purpose of
engaging in war, seem to be men fit for any bold undertaking.</font><br></div>

of it as fatted bullocks,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, they
fill themselves with the abundance of Egypt; and hence it was that they became a
prey to their enemies; for we know that nothing is more injurious to soldiers
than to live delicately and luxuriously. Of all ancient generals, the most
celebrated is Hannibal; but how did it happen, that having an invincible army,
by which he had terrified all Italy, he afterwards fell? because Campania, with
its luxuries, enervated him, for he lived there not like a soldier, but had
tables richly furnished for himself and for his army. Hence it was, that they
were no more what they had been. So also the Prophet says, &#8220;Egypt will
ruin its hired soldiers; for she will satiate them with luxuries.&#8221; What
did at length happen to them? he compares them to bullocks of the stall,

Prophet, as to confirm what he had taught. The figures, then, which he now uses,
were not intended as ornaments of speech, but rather for the purpose of giving
force and power to what he had said; for, as it has been said, prophecies had no
credit with stupid men, unless stimulants were added to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says now, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>voice of Egypt would go forth

</i>though it were a serpent;&#8221; but I prefer to render it in the genitive
case, and it is more suitable; for the Prophet means that the complaints of
Egypt would not be obstreperous; as serpents, in creeping, send forth their
hisses, so he intimates that the Egyptians, being overthrown, would be so broken
down, as not to dare to utter open complaints, as those who freely cry out, but
such as would remain alive would be so smitten with fear as only to mutter, as
it has been said of serpents, who hiss as they creep. We now understand the real
meaning of the Prophet: he says that the Egyptians would be so east down as not
to dare openly to complain of their miseries, for they would only mutter, not
otherwise than serpents who, on the ground, indistinctly hiss: <i>its voice,
</i>then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall
advance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or go forth,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>like that of a
serpent</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and thus he points out their
uneasiness, for they would seek hiding-places, and flee here and there, and
never dare to remain in the same place. It is, indeed, a proof of the most
miserable trepidation, when he who succumbs under his evils finds no place to
set his foot on, but is forced, like serpents, to wander here and there.

Egyptians would tremble, and be so broken down, as not to dare to utter their

that the Chaldeans would come into Egypt as hired men come to cut down trees.
Soldiers are, indeed, armed with swords and lances; for they have to do with
enemies, nor can they overcome without danger, at least they cannot conquer
without striving; but the Prophet says that the Chaldeans would be so filled
with <i>confidence, </i>that they would not regard the Egyptians as enemies, for
they would come, as it were, to cut down trees which offer no resistance:

<div><font face="Palatino">He goes on here with the same subject. He indeed uses
the past tense, but we know that this was commonly done by the Prophets. He
compares the people of Egypt to a forest, as he had said that individual men
would be like trees: <i>They have </i>then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cut
down</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, <i>they </i>shall cut.
down </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>its forest, saith
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For the sake of confirmation he
ascribes the words to God; as though he had said, that he predicted nothing but
what God had determined to do. His object then was to remove every doubt;
because the Jews might on the one hand have refused to believe this prophecy on
considering the power of Egypt; and the Egyptians on the other might have
disregarded these threatenings, confiding in their own strength. Hence the
Prophet introduces God as the speaker, as though he had said, &#8220;This decree
cannot be revoked, because God hath spoken.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says, that they had

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rqj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>chekor, </i>properly means to inquire, to investigate; and the sentence may
be thus suitably rendered, <i>&#8220;That </i>the forest may not be
investigated.&#8221; Yet another meaning has been more approved, that the
Chaldeans shall not be numbered. If this view be received, there is a Change of
number, for it immediately follows, &#8220;They shall multiply,&#8221;

ill suit the passage, that is, that there would be no investigation of the
forest of Egypt, that is, of the people; for when a forest is cut down, it
appears a naked plain, nor can the place of any tree be pointed out. As to the
general meaning, there is not much difference. The Prophet, in short, means,
that the slaughter, of which he prophecies, would be so great, that Egypt would
be reduced to a waste, because the Chaldeans would come with a numerous army:
and he sets up this number in opposition to the Egyptian forces, that they might
know that their enemies would be far superior to them. It follows &#8212;

sets God&#8217;s glory in opposition to the perverseness of his own nation; for,
as it has been said, he effected but little when he threatened the Egyptians.
For the Jews, believing that land to be impregnable, were secure; because they
thought that the Egyptians would come to their aid, and so they believed that
they were fortified against any hostile power. As then the Jews were inebriated
with this false confidence, the Prophet was constrained, not only with many

was not born, who called it by his own name; but it had its old name
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">an</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>na</i>, and it was so called by the Hebrews. In after time it was called
Alexandria, its name having been changed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But there is here a statement of a part for the
whole, for the Prophet included the whole of Egypt; what is general is
comprehended under what is particular; for God spared not the other cities of
Egypt; and it appears from the context that the prophecy extended to all parts
of that land, not one angle, even the least, being excepted. But as Alexandria
might have remained safe, while the other cities were destroyed, it is here
especially mentioned, as though he had said, that nothing would be safe in
Egypt. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will visit the
multitude</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. It was a very populous
city, as we gather from heathen writers; and hence it was that it was full of
pride, for they thought it sufficiently safe when they had as it were a
proportionate army. But the Prophet derides this vain glory, and says that the
vast number of people in Alexandria would avail nothing to prevent the Chaldeans
to take possession of it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>I will visit, </i>he says, the whole people, and
then </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pharaoh and
Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We now clearly see that the city
named was the chief city, and that its multitude was expressly mentioned, that
the Egyptians might know, that they could not escape destruction, because they
had war with God, and not with men; for as long as they looked on the Chaldeans
alone, they remained secure. But the Prophet awakens them from their lethargy,
and says, that they were not to look on what the Chaldeans of themselves could
do, for they would carry on war under the banner of God, and under his guidance
would, without any difficulty, penetrate through the whole of Egypt. Hence he
says, I will visit </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pharaoh and
Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds, <i>and her gods. </i>We know that that land
was very much given to superstitions, that the Egyptians had imbibed gross and
shameful errors, though otherwise remarkable for their wisdom and knowledge. But
God had smitten them with madness, so that they were become almost like brute
beasts. Besides, as they thought that they had perfect safety in their idols,
the Prophet shakes off this confidence, and declares that God would not only be
the judge of men but also of the idols. For we know that men strengthen
themselves against God&#8217;s threatenings either by superstition or by
confidence in their own strength: as long as they depend on the world, they
gather from all quarters some grounds of hope; and hence it is, that they think
that they will be safe though in opposition to God&#8217;s will. The Prophet
beats down this folly when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I will visit the
multitude of Alexandria</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and
adds,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> I will visit the
gods</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of Egypt. As the unbelieving, when
they find earthly aids not sufficient for them, flee to God, but not in the
right way, for they become vain in their foolish thoughts; hence is the reason
why the Prophet threatens the idols of Egypt.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds, <i>her kings. </i>There was indeed but one
king in Egypt, why then does he mention kings? This may be explained of
successors; but I prefer taking <i>&#8220;kings&#8221; </i>here as meaning the
satraps and princes, for we know that the kingdom was very opulent, that it had
many equal to kings. I therefore think that the Prophet adorned the princes and
satraps of Egypt with this high title; and he confirms this opinion by what
immediately follows, even
<i>-</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pharaoh and those who
trust in him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He repeats the name of
Pharaoh, and when he says that he would visit those who trust in him, I doubt
not but that the Prophet points out those whom he had before designated
<i>&#8220;kings.&#8221; </i>We now then perceive the real meaning, that though
Pharaoh had many defenses, being strengthened by a great multitude of men, and
had also mighty satraps, yet all this would prove fading and evanescent, when he
would have to carry on war with God: and God declares here that he would be the
general of the whole war guiding and directing the Chaldeans. It now follows,

purpose was that his mercy should be made evident in the judgments he executed
even on foreign nations; and further, it served to confirm prophecy, when to
Egypt, after having been destroyed, was granted that restoration of which

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now directs his discourse to the
Israelites; for we have already said that he was not appointed a teacher to
heathen nations. Whatever, then, he spoke of heathen nations had a reference to
the benefit of his people; and for this purpose, as we have said, the Prophets
extended their prophecies respecting God&#8217;s judgments to all nations; for
otherwise the Israelites would have been disheartened, as though their condition
was worse than that of others: &#8220;What can this mean? God has chosen us as
his peculiar people; in the meantime we alone are miserable: God pours forth on
us his whole rigor, and yet he spares the unbelieving. It would have been better
for us to have been rejected wholly by him, for the covenant which he has made
with us only renders us more miserable than others.&#8221; Thus the miserable
Israelites might have rushed headlong into despair, had nothing been done in
time to relieve them. And then the Prophets, or rather the Spirit of God who
spoke by them, regarded another thing; for if nothing had been predicted they
would have passed by, with closed eyes, those judgments which God executed on
all their neighbors, for all that Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel had predicted
was fulfilled. Had they been silent respecting the ruin of Egypt, of the
Philistines and the Moabites, the people, owing to their torpor, would not have
considered God&#8217;s judgments, but would have thought them to have all
happened by chance. The Prophets then represented as in a mirror the power of
God, that the Israelites might know that it extended to the whole world and to
every nation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is the reason why Jeremiah now turns his
discourse to the chosen people, and says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fear not, my servant
Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He still speaks in God&#8217;s
name. Now God calls Jacob his servant, not on the ground of obedience, but
because he had chosen him. Then by this word God sets forth the favor of
adoption, and not the obedience of the people, for we know how refractory and
disobedient they were; we know that they were continually shaking off the yoke,
that they insulted as it were God himself; very far were they from quietly
submitting to his authority as it became servants. Here, then, the obedience of
the Israelites is not commended, but that election is set forth by which God had
set them apart from other nations. How then was Jacob God&#8217;s servant? not
because he deserved that honor by his own merits, but because God had been
pleased gratuitously to choose him for himself. So also David
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I am thy servant,
the son of thy
handmaid,&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19B616&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
116:16)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He means that he was as it were a hereditary servant,
who had been already dedicated to God before he was conceived in his
mother&#8217;s womb. But as this mode of speaking often occurs, I pass it by
with only a few words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fear not, O
Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and be not broken in mind, O
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There are indeed two names used,
but God thus addresses his people often; and why? <i>because
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I wall save
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We now then see why God called
Jacob his servant, even because the salvation of the elect people depended on
this peculiar privilege, that God had chosen them for himself;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will save
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from
far</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The ten tribes, as it is well
known, had already been driven far, and a part of Judah had been led into exile.
Distance took away the hope of a return. Hence God here declares that a long
distance would be no hindrance to him to restore his people when it seemed good
to him; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I will save
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He then obviates this objection;
&#8220;What! why then does God thus suffer us to be driven to foreign lands? why
have we not staid in our own land?&#8221; God, he says, will not be less able to
save thee in the remotest places, than if thou hadst remained in thy native
country, and in thine own habitation. And he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and thy seed, from the land of
their captivity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence learn, that though the Prophet spoke of the
temporal restoration of the people, he yet had a regard to higher and greater
things, even that the captives should recumb on God&#8217;s mercy, and believe
that he would be propitious to them even when dead. This passage then shews that
the hope of God&#8217;s children is not confined to this life, but extends
farther, in order that they may know that God will be propitious to them after
death, and that they may sustain themselves with the assurance of his favor, for
otherwise this promise that God would restore their children after their death
would have been absurd. &#8220;But why is he implacable to us? why does he not
restore us sooner?&#8221; The Jews might have raised this objection; but the
Prophet reminds them, that though they were not to be restored immediately to
their country, yet the covenant of God would remain valid, and its stability
would appear after seventy years.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive why the Prophet said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jacob shall return and rest, and
shall be secure</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I wonder that some have
rendered the last words, &#8220;and shall be happy,&#8221; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;na&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>shanun, </i>means to be secure, or to rest; and then the Prophet explains
himself, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>nor will there be any to
terrify</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We indeed know that it is the
main part of happiness when no fear disturbs us, when our minds are in a
composed and quiet state. Further, by these words he intimates the continuance
of God&#8217;s favor, as though he had said that his favor would not only be
evident in restoring the people from exile, but in restoring the miserable in
such a way as to grant them full and continued happiness. It follows, &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">He repeats the same thing, and no wonder, for under
circumstances so hopeless it was not easy to raise up and sustain the minds of
the people, so that they might patiently wait for the time of their redemption.
He had to raise them to light as it were from the lowest depths, for captivity
was little short of death, according to what Ezekiel says, (Ezekiel 37) who
shews that the common saying among them was,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Can God raise the
dead from their graves?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Whenever the Prophets promised that God would become
their Redeemer, they said, &#8220;Oh, will God raise us up again? It is all a
fable.&#8221; For this reason God commanded dead and dry bones to rise and to
assume their own skin and flesh, at least this was shewn to the Prophet in a
vision.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now then understand why the Prophet repeated twice
what was in itself sufficiently clear,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fear not, my servant
Jacob,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>even because they could not
apprehend God&#8217;s mercy, except they looked off from their great
difficulties, and further, because it was not enough for them once to embrace
this promise, without recumbing on it constantly. Hence the Prophet, in order to
encourage them firmly to hope, and at the same time to render them persevering,
and to confirm them, says twice,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fear not, my servant
Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He then adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am with
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And this promise, as it has been
said, depends on gratuitous adoption, because God had chosen that people for
himself, that they might be a priestly kingdom.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I will make a consummation
among all the nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. By this
comparison he softens and alleviates all sorrow: for however bitter the
condition of the people might be, yet when they considered that fled would deal
milder with them than with other mortals, it was a cause of ample consolation.
The Prophet, then, seeing that the Jews, while their minds were embittered,
could not accept God&#8217;s favor, shews here, that however severely God might
chastise them, he yet would be more merciful to them than to other nations: how
so?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will make a
consummation among other nations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that
is, they shall be destroyed without any remedy; as though he had said, that the
wound he would inflict on other nations would be deadly, but that he would not
make a consummation as to his chosen people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This seems not to agree with what he had said before,
that Egypt should be again inhabited as in days of old. How can the restoration
of Egypt be consistent with the words of the Prophet here? To this I answer,
that when God mitigates his rigor towards the unbelieving, he is not yet
propitious to them, nor is the indulgence shewn to them a proof of his paternal
favor, as I have before observed. Though then there were Egyptians who remained
alive after the ruin of their kingdom, yet God made a consummation in Egypt, for
there his vengeance continued after that, time. Now, when we come to the chosen
people, God says in many places,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will not make a
consummation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There seems to be here
again some contrariety, when any one attends only to the words; for God is said
to have made a consummation as to his elect people: but this was the case, when
he destroyed the whole body of the people; and that consummation was external;
there ever remained at the same time some hidden root.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short, when God says, that he makes a consummation
as to heathen nations, it ought to be understood, that God curses them from the
root. As when a tree stands, when its root is dead; so also heathen nations, as
it were, stand, but in the meantime they are consumed, for God has doomed them
to eternal ruin. But consummation is said to be as to God&#8217;s children, when
nothing appears on the surface, but perhaps a dry trunk; yet a living root
remains, which will again grow up, and from it branches will arise. We hence see
how God makes a consummation as to all the unbelieving, and yet does not make a
consummation as to his chosen people.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>PRAYER</b></font><br></div>

promise, may never doubt, even when thou severely chastisest us, but that thou
wilt at length be merciful to us, and that we may thus never cease to flee to
thy mercy, and thus submit to thee, and suffer ourselves to be corrected; and
may, in the meantime, this hope sustain us, and alleviate all our sorrows, that
in all our miseries we shall yet ever glorify thy name, through the same, thy
Son our Lord. &#8212; Amen.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">LECTURE ONE
HUNDRED AND SIXTY-EIGHTH</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WE explained yesterday what is meant by not making a
consummation. The meaning is, that sometimes God&#8217;s vengeance is such
towards his Church, that it seems to be consumed, while yet some hidden hope
remains, for God raises his own as it were from death. We said, that in this
sense is to be understood what Jeremiah now promises to the chosen people: for
God makes a distinction between the Israelites and strangers; for on account of
the covenant he had made with them, he would spare them, so that some hope
remained, though the Church itself seemed for a time to be
lost.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he explains himself in other words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will chastise
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in
judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for to chastise in judgment is
to exercise moderation, so that rigor may not issue in destruction. In the tenth
chapter, Jeremiah says the same, &#8220;Chastise me, O Jehovah, but in judgment,
and not in thine anger.&#8221; The Prophet, then, in the person of the faithful
submitted himself to the scourges of God, because it was useful for them to be
corrected, for had the Lord spared them, they would have abused his
<i>indulgence, </i>and have become thus putrid in their vices. Hence the Prophet
offered himself to be chastised by God, but <i>deprecated </i>his anger, which
he set in opposition to judgment. The word judgment, in Hebrew, is taken in
various senses; but in that passage, as I explained there, it means due measure,
or moderation. When God punishes the unbelieving, he cannot be charged with
extreme severity, for he is ever just and regards a due measure. But, as I have
already said, judgment means not only rectitude, but also the paternal love of
God, when he moderates punishment, so as to render it medicinal and salutary to
his elect. Hence he promises to punish his Church moderately, not only because
he is just, but also because he mercifully spares his own, and regards what they
can bear, and what is useful for them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this passage ought to be especially noticed, from
which we may derive great consolation; for we are here taught that punishments
inflicted on us are temporary, and that God prescribes limits to them, such as
he knows to be best for us: for whence comes despair which overwhelms the
unbelieving, except that being sunk in the deep, they know not that God will be
merciful to them, but apprehend nothing but his wrath? Hence then it comes that
they have no comfort in their evils and sorrows. Whenever, then, excessive
anxiety lays hold on us, or our evils drive us into despair, let us learn to
flee to this consolation, even that the punishments by which we are chastised
are only for a time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And cutting off I will not cut
thee off</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There are some who give
another rendering, &#8220;I will not make thee innocent: &#8220; and in this
sense the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hqn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>nuke, </i>is sometimes to be taken; but it is not suitable to the context
here, unless the copulative be rendered as an adversative, &#8220;Though I shall
not make thee innocent, I shall yet chastise thee with paternal
moderation.&#8221; As this, however, seems forced, I doubt not but that the
Prophet means, that chastisement would be moderated, because God would not
wholly cut off his chosen people, according to the exposition I gave on the
thirtieth chapter of this book; and thus the Prophet confirms what I have
already said, that God spares his children, because he purifies them by
afflictions, as gold is melted and purified by fire, so that punishment does not
issue in their destruction. Now follows the forty-seventh
chapter:</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah prophesies here against the Philistines, who
were enemies to the Israelites, and had contrived against them many cruel and
unjust things. There is then no doubt, but that God intended to testify, by this
prophecy, his love towards the Israelites, for he undertook their cause, and
avenged the wrongs done to them. We hence perceive why God had predicted the
ruin of the Philistines, even that the Israelites might know his paternal love
towards them, as he set himself against their enemies; and thus he gave them a
reason for patience, because it behooved them to wait until God fulfilled this
prophecy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he points out the time,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Before Pharaoh smote

<div><font face="Palatino">Now Jeremiah says, that he prophesied against the
Philistines </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before Pharaoh
smote</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that city, but he did not demolish
it. But we see that the Prophet threatens nothing to it from the Egyptians, but
rather from the Chaldeans. Why then does he speak here of
Pharaoh?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must refer to history, and then we shall see what
the design of the Holy Spirit was. When Pharaoh came to bring assistance to the
Jews under Zedekiah, as we have already seen, he was soon compelled to return to
Egypt, for the Chaldeans, having raised the siege, went against the Egyptians;
for if they routed them, they knew that they could soon possess themselves of
the whole of Judea. Haying then left the Jews for a time, they went against the
Egyptians. Pharaoh, possessing no confidence in himself, as I have said,
retreated; but he plundered Gaza in his way, <i>because </i>it was very hostile
to the <i>Jews; </i>and he wished to shew that he did not come altogether in
vain, though this afforded no relief to the Jews. But thus in things of nought
earthly kings shew off themselves. Pharaoh then at that time plundered Gaza, but
he did not retain it. At this time Jeremiah predicted greater calamities. And
this ought to be carefully noticed, for there would be no reason why the Prophet
spake of the Philistines, except, he had respect to something farther. Let us
now then come to the second verse:</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, no doubt, wished to remind the Jews that
it would only be a prelude when Gaza was plundered, and that a far more grievous
punishment was impending over that ungodly nation, which had done so many wrongs
to God&#8217;s people. For if Gaza had suffered only that loss, the Jews might
have complained of their lot, as those ungodly men who had acted so wickedly and
in so many ways provoked God&#8217;s vengeance, had lightly suffered. They might
then have objected and said, &#8220;What can this mean? God has indeed lightly
smitten Gaza; but we would thus willingly redeem our lives: as those who wish to
avoid shipwreck cast forth their goods into the sea, and whatever precious thing
they may have; so we, if life only be given us, are prepared to part with all
our property.&#8221; The Jews then might have thus deplored their lot. Hence the
Prophet says, that something more grievous awaited that city.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;When ye see Gaza plundered,&#8221; he says,
<i>&#8220;think </i>not that this is the last judgment of God; <i>for,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>behold, waters shall rise
from the north</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, the Chaldeans
shall complete the work of executing God&#8217;s vengeance; the Egyptians shall
only plunder the wealth of the city, which will be endurable; but at length the
Chaldeans will come to exercise boundless cruelty, and they shall be like a
flood, and shall overwhelm Gaza, so as utterly to destroy it.&#8221; We now,
then, see what the Prophet meant: there is implied a comparison between the
plunder effected by the Egyptians and the final ruin brought on it by the
Chaldeans.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The <i>rising </i>or ascending of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>waters</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is evidently a metaphorical expression. He adds that they would be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>an overflowing
torrent</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, the waters would be
like an inundating river; <i>and they will inundate the land. </i>He speaks of
the land of the Philistines, where this city was.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They will
inundate</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the land and its
fullness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Fullness is taken in Hebrew
for opulence or wealth; trees, corn, and animals are called the fullness of the
land; for when the land brings forth no corn and no fruits, when it breeds no
animals, it is deemed naked and empty. As then God clothes the land with such
ornaments, the land is said to be full, when it abounds in those productions
with which God enriches it. he afterwards speaks of men, <i>the city, </i>he
says; he speaks not now of the city Gaza, but of the whole country; then the
singular number is to be taken here for the plural. At length he says, Cry
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall men, and howl shall all the
inhabitants of the land</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The number as
to the verbs is here changed, but there is no ambiguity in the meaning. And by
these words the Prophet intimates, that a most grievous punishment would be
inflicted on the Philistines, so that they would not only cry for sorrow, but
even howl. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

grievous would be the calamity, that fathers would not have a care for their

divest themselves of their natural feelings. When a father has children, he
would willingly undergo ten deaths, if necessary, in order to save their life;
but when men forget that they are parents, it is a proof, as I have said, of the
greatest grief, as though men, having changed their nature, were become logs of

hands he means loss of courage or fainting. For as vigor spreads from the heart
through every part of the body, so also the bands are the chief instruments of
all actions. When therefore the bands are relaxed and become feeble, it follows
that men become as it were inanimate. The Prophet now means that the Philistines
would become like the dead, so as not to move, no, not even their fingers; and
why? because they would be so terrified by the stamping of horses, by the
commotion of chariots, and by the rumbling of wheels, that they would lose their
senses. It follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>

the time of Isaiah had its own king; yet afterwards in the time of Alexander the
Great the city was free, as it is well known. These, however, were cities of
Palestine, and the people called then Philistines were contiguous to these
cities, so that the Prophet rightly includes them as it were in the same bundle.

devoured the mother, according to the common proverb. For Tyre in time
flourished, and Sidon became almost forsaken. It, however, always retained a
name and also some wealth on account of its commodious harbor. But Tyre was an
island in the time of Alexander the Great; and was therefore more commodious for
ships, as it had many harbors. But the Prophet connects them both together,
because they formed then a part of the land of the Philistines. There is no
doubt but that the destruction was especially denounced on these cities, that
the Jews might know that nothing would be safe throughout the whole land,
inasmuch as these cities, the defenses, as it were, of the whole country, were
destined to perish.</font><br></div>

country, interpreters have supposed that others, and not Cappadocians, are here
called Caphtorim. Yet Moses intimates
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;050223&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy

he might more fully illustrate his prophecy, and more powerfully move the Jews.
Now by <i>baldness </i>he points out a sign of mourning; for they were wont even
to tear their faces with their nails, and to pluck off their hair. He then says
that <i>baldness, </i>or the loss of hair, <i>had

the situation of that part, because they were hid, as it were, in a safe place,
and they thought themselves secure as those who are hid in caverns, to which an
access is not easy; and then Tyre and Sidon, as well as Gaza, were cities on the
sea side. As then they dwelt in these deep and hidden places, they thought,
themselves far away from every danger and trouble. The Prophet derides this
confidence, and says that the

no end to their calamities, because the Palestines would mourn perpetually: for
otherwise they who are even most grievously afflicted do not perpetually mourn,
for time alleviates grief and sorrow. The Prophet then shews that so dreadful
would be God&#8217;s vengeance, that evils would be heaped on evils, and thus
renewed daily to the Palestines would be the cause of mourning. He afterwards

characters while endeavor-ing more fully to confirm their doctrine. It is the
same, then, as though he represented here the Philistines; and the Prophets
speak also often in the person of those on whom they denounce the vengeance of
God. It is here as though he had said, &#8220;The Philistines will humbly ask
pardon of God&#8217;s sword, but it will be without advantage or profit; for

speaks of Tyre, and Sidon, and Gaza, though he names Ashkelon, which was a
little distant from the sea. When, therefor, God commanded his sword against
Ashkelon and all the cities which were by the sea-shore, the execution of his
judgement could not be prevented in that region. He further
adds</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, he hath commanded
it;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> but it is in a solemn manner, and hence I
have rendered the words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he hath
called it to witness</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or protested it. He then
intimates that God had not simply given his sword a command to commit slaughters
through the whole land, but bound his sword, as it were, by solemn protest; as
though he had said, that this decree could not be revoked, because Godwill not
only command his sword to execute his vengeance, but will also give it a solemn
command, and bind it, as it were, by an oath, never to cease from its work until
the whole people, and all the cities, and the whole land, should be destroyed
together.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This division is made by the <i>Sept., </i>though not

<div><font face="Palatino">The word for &#8220;violent,&#8221; or cruel, is so
construed in the early versions; the <i>Targ. </i>alone countenances our
version. The last line conveys a different idea from the preceding. The verb,
indeed, means strong in number as well as strong in power; but as number is
expressed in the previous line, we may justly consider that power is meant here:
their sins were not only many, but strong and vigorous, so strong as to resist
all exhortations and all threatenings. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF12</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Rather

indeed means sometimes the soreness or wound of the mind, that is, sorrow or
grief; but here, no doubt, it retains its primary idea, correspondently with
stroke, bruise, and wound. The <i>Targ. </i>retains this meaning, while the
versions go all astray. Then it is, &#8220;Miserable is thy sore.&#8221; The
rest of the verse is as follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Because multiplied had thine iniquity,

&#8220;therefore,&#8221; or for this reason, as anticipative of what is
contained at the end of the next verse, &#8220;Because an outcast have they
called thee. Sion, whom no one seeks.&#8221; <i>Venema, </i>apprehending this to
be the sense of the passage, supposed that the two verses have been transposed:

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF14</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
versions and the <i>Targ. </i>render the word for &#8220;palace,&#8221; temple;

this the same preposition is used, and seems to require a similar construction,
&#8220;on its former spot,&#8221; or, on its wonted place. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">fp&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">
denotes what is customary or usual, as well as what is right and just. Then the
two lines would read thus, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">And built shall be the city on its
ruins, And the palace on its wonted seat shall be fixed, (or shall
stand.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the versions and the <i>Targ. </i>vary the
meaning of the preposition. The <i>Vulg., </i>with which the rest essentiall y
agree, is, &#8220;And the temple according to its order, shall be

decreased: and when it is said, &#8220;I will glorify,&#8221; or honor
&#8220;them,&#8221; the corresponding contrast to this is, &#8220;they shall not
be degraded,&#8221; or dishonored. The first clause refers to number, and the
second to honor, dignity, or renown. Then the right version would be as follows,
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">And I will multiply them, and they shall

the stated festivals. The verb means to be confirmed, to be fixed, to be made

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF22</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I find
nothing satisfactory as to this verse, except the explanation here given, and it

imperative too. It appears that the latter part of the last verse, this verse,
and that which follows, contain what would be addressed to the people after
their return. In no other way can the verbs be grammatically rendered. The whole
address is as follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;Eat the fruit,&#8221;<i> </i>is the meaning,

<i>Blayney. </i>&#8220;Call ye,&#8221;<i> </i>or, proclaim, or, give the
invitation. The news was to be made known &#8220;among the chief of the

people,&#8221; <i>i.e., </i>Jacob&#8217;s. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wllh</font><font face="Palatino">
means not only to praise, but also to boast, to exult, and here evidently to
proclaim with exultation or triumph. It is rendered here &#8220;sing ye,&#8221;

<div><font face="Palatino">It is worthy of notice, that in this episode the
particulars, mentioned in the 4th verse

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF26</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
<i>Targ. </i>and the Versions, excepting the <i>Vulg., </i>give a similar
meaning to these two clauses. They give the sense of &#8220;departing&#8221; to
the first verb, while it commonly has the sense of &#8220;coming.&#8221; It is
also in the future tense, and therefore cannot refer to the departing of the
Israelites, who are meant here, for they had already gone into exile. Their
return is no doubt what is spoken of, which would be attended with
&#8220;weeping,&#8221; not for joy, but for their sins, as it is distinctly
expressed in verses 18 and 19
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;243118&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
31:18-19); and also with entreaties or supplications. And it is better with

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">With weeping shall they come and with
supplications; I will bring them, I will lead them, By streams of water, in a
straight way; They shall not stumble in it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He promises two things, to &#8220;bring&#8221; and to
&#8220;lead;&#8221; then the leading refers to the streams of water, and the
bringing to the straight way; which is a kind of arrangement that is often to be
met with in Scripture. Two things, especially necessary for travelers, are
promised, water and a good road. &#8220;Straight&#8221; seems to apply to the
surface of the road as well as to its sides; hence some render it
&#8220;smooth&#8221; or even, such as would have nothing that might cause one to
stumble. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF27</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> What is
here said is no doubt true: but the auxiliary verb is, &#8220;I was,&#8221; not
&#8220;I<i> </i>shall be;&#8221; and so it is rendered by the <i>Sept., Vulg.,
</i>and <i>Targ.; </i>and by the <i>Syr., </i>I am. Then the Versions, very
incorrectly, give the next clause, in which there is no verb, in the present
tense,<i> </i>while it ought to be in the past tense, like the foregoing. The
words literally are, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">For I was (or, have been) to Jacob a
Father, And Ephraim, my first-born he <i>(i.e. was </i>he.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And to this purpose has <i>Blayney </i>rendered the

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lag</font><font face="Palatino">

42:36. Joseph was not, he being dead; and Simeon was not, he being absent in

passage, as quoted by Matthew, refers to such as were dead. The similarity was
only in part, that is, as to the weeping.<i> &#8212; Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF33</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
quotation in Matthew is neither from the Hebrew nor from the <i>Sept. </i>It is
substantially correct, but not verbally; the sense and not the words, seems to
have been chiefly regarded by the Apostles.<i> &#8212; Ed.</i></font><br></div>

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF35</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Or the

So <i>Gataker, </i>not without reason, renders the words. The following clause
explains what this <i>&#8220;hope&#8221; </i>was. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF36</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The idea
of &#8220;transmigrating&#8221; is alone given by the <i>Vulg.,</i> the other
versions and the <i>Targ. </i>have &#8220;lamenting:&#8221; and the latter is
more consonant with the context, and has been adopted by almost all modern
commentators. It is used in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;241505&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
15:5, in the sense of being moved or affected for another, of sympathizing or
condoling. It is there in its simple form, that is, in <i>Kal. </i>As it is here
in <i>Hithpael, </i>its meaning is, self-condoling, or condoling himself,
&#8212; an idea which is very expressive, and is more fully explained in the
next verse. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF37</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This is
no doubt the right rendering, and not, &#8220;Thou<i> </i>art Jehovah my
God.&#8221; So in the first commandment, the version ought to be, &#8220;I<i>
</i>Jehovah,&#8221; or, I the Lord, &#8220;am thy God.&#8221; The meaning is
not, that he is Jehovah, but that he who is Jehovah is our God. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF38</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
<i>Vulg. </i>and the <i>Targ. </i>favor this view of a different sense of the
same verb in the second clause. The <i>Sept. </i>retain the same meaning. There
is no need of altering the sense; indeed, another sense does not so well comport
with the passage. He says that God had chastised him, and that he was chastised
as an untamed, or rather untrained steer or bullock, implying that he was
compelled to bear the yoke, and also that he had been<i> </i>brought to submit
to it: hence the prayer that follows, &#8220;turn,&#8221; or rather, restore,
etc. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rsy</font><font face="Palatino">
means to correct rather than to chastise, even to correct by the rod, or by the
goad; and then to teach as the effect of correction, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Thou hast corrected me; Yea, I was
corrected like a steer, not trained:  Restore thou me, and I shall be restored; 
For thou, Jehovah, art my God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">After a confession with regard to correction, a
confession that intimates that it had its proper effect, a prayer for
restoration seems suitable, and that prayer is founded on the fact that Jehovah
was their God.<i> &#8212; Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF39</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> What
<i>Calvin </i>teaches here is indisputable, but whether the passage warrants the
view he takes of it, is another thing, though most commentators have taken the
same view. The versions, especially the <i>Vulg., </i>seem to have suggested
this explanation by giving to the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bw&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
in the former verse, the meaning of turning or conversion, instead of returning
or restoring, agreeably with the whole context, see verse 17<sup>th</sup>
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;243117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
31:17). <i>Gataker </i>suggested this idea; and it was afterwards fully adopted
by <i>Venema: </i>and, according to their views I render this verse as follows,
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">For after I returned to myself, I
repented, And after I knew myself, I smote my thigh;  I was ashamed and even
confounded, Because I have borne the reproach of my youth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The <i>Vulg.</i> renders the first words,
&#8220;After thou hast turned,&#8221; or converted &#8220;me (convertisti me;
)&#8221; the <i>Sept., </i>&#8220;After<i> </i>my captivity;&#8221; the <i>Syr.,
</i>&#8220;After that I was converted;&#8221; and the <i>Targ., </i>&#8220;When
we return to the Law.&#8221; Literally the words are, &#8220;After my
returning,&#8221; which, according to the Hebrew idiom may be rendered,
&#8220;After returning to myself,&#8221; as in the following line, &#8220;after
my knowing,&#8221; means evidently &#8220;after knowing
myself.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The two verses contain the language of the penitent,
praying for restoration to their own land: and two reasons are assigned for this
prayer, &#8212; because Jehovah was their covenanted God, &#8212; and because
they repented, for to such had restoration been promised: Hence for is used
twice; it is therefore not right to render

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF40</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
verse has been variously explained. The two questions are taken by <i>Calvin

answer to penitent Ephraim. Neither the <i>Sept., </i>nor the <i>Vulg., </i>nor
the <i>Syr., </i>nor the <i>Targ. </i>retain the interrogatory form: but they
retain the meaning, if the questions be taken affirmatively, not otherwise. The

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">For since my words <i>are </i>in
him,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Remembering I will still

<div><font face="Palatino">This is according to the <i>Sept., </i>and the

Israel, return, To thy cities ascend.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word for &#8220;highway&#8221; means a raised
road, a road prepared for travelling. The &#8220;virgin&#8221;<i> </i>here
signifies one that is of an age to be married. When Israel repented, they were
in a fit state to be united to God, as their husband. The last line is rendered
according to the proposed emendation of <i>Houbigant </i>and approved by

instead of,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hla</font><font face="Palatino">

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF43</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
verb, rendered &#8220;going about,&#8221; only occurs here in <i>Hithpael,
</i>and once in <i>Kal, </i>Cant. v. 6; where it means to
&#8220;withdraw,&#8221; or recede, or turn aside. And this sense of withdrawing
is what is given to it here both by the <i>Sept., </i>the <i>Targ., </i>and the
<i>Syr.; </i>but it is the withdrawing from accepting the return offered. We may
give this version, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">How long wilt thou decline, (i.e., to return,) O
daughter of the restoration? She had been before exhorted to return in the
previous verse: she is now blamed for her unwillingness, which seems to have
arisen from fear, and a sense of weakness. Then comes in most appropriately what
follows, if interpreted according to the explanation of <i>Calvin. </i>The verb

the root of,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hbbw&ccedil;h</font><font face="Palatino">,

&#8212; <i>Ed</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF44</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Whatever
may be the meaning of this clause, it cannot certainly be applied to the
miraculous conception of our Saviour, and for this plain reason, as <i>Blayney
</i>observes,<i> </i>that the only thing the passage announces, if viewed in
this light, is this, &#8212; that a woman shall conceive a male child, which is
nothing new, but a common event; for the word here for &#8220;woman,&#8221; is
not what signifies a virgin, but what designates only the sex; it means properly
a female as distinguished from a male. <i>Henry, </i>as well as <i>Blayney
</i>and Adam <i>Clarke, </i>agree materially with <i>Calvin, </i>as to the
meaning of this sentence. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF45</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
principal objection to this interpretation has been, that it was not by
overcoming their enemies by force of arms that the Jews returned. The answer to
this is, that this is a sort of proverbial expression, intimating that the
weakest would prevail over the strongest. Besides, though the Jews returned by
virtue of the edict of the king of Persia, yet they had many and strong enemies
to oppose them. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF46</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

cities, Husbandmen together, and they shall go about with
flocks.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Like <i>Calvin </i>he takes &#8220;cities&#8221; for
citizens; but still there is an inappropriateness in the words. I regard the

&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">And dwell in it, <i>the land </i>of

security. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.</font><br></div>

&#8220;weary&#8221; and &#8220;sorrowful&#8221; of our version are no doubt
wrong; the first, adopted from the <i>Vulg.;</i> and the second from the

<div><font face="Palatino">The 38th verse
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;243138&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
31:38) contains a general description; this is particularized in the following
verses. The beginning of measuring was to be at &#8220;the tower of
Hananeel;&#8221; hence &#8220;from over against it,&#8221;<i> </i>or before it:
the &#8220;gate&#8221;<i> </i>being feminine cannot be meant; it is then
&#8220;the tower.&#8221; As to the word for &#8220;fields,&#8221; the reading of
the <i>Keri </i>and of several MSS., countenanced by the <i>Vulg., </i>ought no
doubt to be adopted. &#8220;Eastward,&#8221; &#8212; thus<i> </i>the line came
round to the same point where it began; for the tower of Hananeel was eastward.
But what is referred to in the two last lines? The verbs are in the masculine
gender, and &#8220;city&#8221;<i> </i>is feminine; and there is nothing in the
passage with which they can agree except the tower of Hananeel. Then this tower
seems to stand here for the rebuilt city; and then rooting up, <i>i.e.,
</i>undermining the foundations, and demolishing, are suitably applied to a
tower. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF58</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some
think, such as <i>Gataker </i>and <i>Blayney, </i>that according to the
description here given, the dimensions of the city are much larger than what
they had ever been before. The &#8220;line&#8221;<i> </i>was to inclose a part
at least of the hill of Gareb, the whole of Goath, supposed to be Golgotha, the
valley of the carcases, and the fields of Kidron, all which were formerly
without the walls of the city. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.</font><br></div>

connected with Jeremiah when he received the vision which he proceeds to relate
in the 6th verse. Instead of &#8220;For then&#8221; in the 2d verse,
&#8220;And<i> </i>then&#8221; would be more proper; and &#8220;Where&#8221;<i>

coming and offer of Hanameel. When Hanameel came, he knew that it was
God&#8217;s will that he should buy the field, and he instantly acted
accordingly. He knew from the very circumstances that it was God&#8217;s

Exactly the same phrase occurs in Genesis 18:14. The word, in a similar clause,

doubt, planted on some of the high places; but there might be mounts without
trees. That these high places were in a valley, favor the idea that they were
artificial mounts without trees. And it indeed appears from this verse and from
Jeremiah 7:31, that the image of Molech was set on the artificial mounts, for it
is said that they <i>built </i>or erected these high places for this purpose,

<div><font face="Palatino">Still, owing to the last clause, the <i>Syriac

is that of <i>Junius </i>and <i>Tremelius. </i>It is difficult to understand the

substantially as follows, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">18. And I will make the men who have

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">19. The princes of Judah, etc.

<div><font face="Palatino">This is the most literal rendering of the passage:
the omission of

like, </i>or as, is not uncommon. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF98</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is

&#8220;</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">duna&gt;stav</font><font face="Palatino">,
rulers,&#8221; by the <i>Sept., </i>&#8220;eunuchs,&#8221;<i> </i>by the
<i>Vulg. </i>and <i>Syr., </i>and &#8220;princes&#8221; by the <i>Targ</i>. They
were the attendants on royalty, not necessarily eunuchs, for Potiphar, who had a

(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;013907&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF99</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> So the

Blaney&#8217;s suggestion is not improbable, that the Prophet, having been
before tried before the princes, (Jeremiah 26) was put under some restraint,
probably forbidden to enter the precincts of the Temple. &#8212;

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF102</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> So the
verb is rendered in the <i>Sept. </i>and <i>Vulg.; </i>but
&#8220;accepted&#8221; by the <i>Syr. </i>and <i>Targ. </i>Our version is a
paraphrase; to convey fully the meaning the word &#8220;humbly&#8221; ought to

supplication,&#8221; etc.<i> &#8212; Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF103</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">8. And Baruch, the son of Neriah, did
according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, in order to read in
the book the words of Jehovah in the house of Jehovah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What Jeremiah had commanded Baruch was to take a roll
and to write the words from his mouth: this Baruch did, and for this purpose,
that he might read the words (as the <i>Targum </i>has it) in the Lord&#8217;s
house. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF104</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
latter part of the verse is differently rendered in the <i>Sept., Syr.,</i> and
the <i>Targ., </i>and more consistently with the Hebrew,
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"> &#8212; proclaim a fast before Jehovah
did all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people that came from the cities
into Jerusalem.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was a fast that the people proclaimed, and not the
king, who was a very ungodly one. His conduct on this occasion proved his great
impiety. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF105</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some
have made two questions here, &#8212; &#8220;How didst thou write all these
words? from his mouth?&#8221; The answer seems to favor this construction; as
usual in Scripture, the last question is answered first, and then the first:
Baruch said, &#8220;From his mouth he pronounced to me all these words;&#8221;
and then he adds, answering the first question, &#8220;and I wrote on the book
with ink.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF106</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There
were no chimneys, and therefore no &#8220;hearths&#8221; in the East. The word
rendered &#8220;hearth&#8221; here means properly a brasier, and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ta</font><font face="Palatino">
before it is a preposition. The verse may be thus rendered,
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">And the king was sitting in the
winter-house, in the ninth month, and at the brasier burning (or, which was
burning) before him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is &#8220;a small altar, arula,&#8221; in the
<i>Vulg.; </i>&#8220;fire&#8221;<i> </i>inthe <i>Syr. </i>and <i>Targ.; </i>but
&#8220;hearth&#8221; in the <i>Sept. &#8212; Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF107</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
idea of trafficking or buying is given by the <i>Sept., </i>&#8220;to<i> </i>buy
thence in the midst of the people.&#8221; The <i>Fulg. </i>is, &#8220;that he
might divide there <i>his </i>possession in the sight of the citizens;&#8221;
and materially the same meaning is given by the <i>Syr. </i> and the <i>Targ.
</i>The literal rendering is, &#8220;For a portion from thence (or, there) among
the people;&#8221; which seems to mean, that he intended to go to the land of
Benjanmin, that he might get his portion or share from the inheritance he had
among his people. So that <i>Blayney&#8217;s </i>version appears to be right,
&#8220;to receive a portion thereof among the people.&#8221; The Chaldeans had
deprived him of his patrimony in the land of Benjamin: when they retreated he
purposed to go there, &#8220;with the view,&#8221; as <i>Blayney </i>observes,
&#8220;of coming in for a share of the produce of the land with the rest of his
neighbors.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF108</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
versions and the <i>Targ. </i>render the word differently; its meaning was not
evidently understood.<i> Blaney  </i>gives the best explanation, who renders it
&#8220;cells.&#8221; &#8220;The dungeon,&#8221; he says, was a deep pit like a
well, and near the bottom were scooped niches, or cells, for the lodgement of
the prisoners. The word comes from,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnh</font><font face="Palatino">,
to fix, to settle, to lodge; hence the plural noun here means places for
prisoners to settle or lodge on, where they could fix themselves, without
sinking in the mire at the bottom of the pit, as the case was with Jeremiah on
another occasion. See
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;243806&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
38:6. That pit, it seems, had no cells. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftF109</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
paragraph is intermingled in the original with the text; but it has been thought
better to introduce it separately. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftG1</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8220;The king,&#8221; observes <i>Blayney, </i>&#8220;evidently speaks this in
disgust with the princes, for endeavoring to frustrate his clemency.&#8221;
&#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftG2</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
Blayney </i>gives a better version, &#8220;torn rags and worn-out rags.&#8221;
The literal rendering is, &#8220;Rags of the torn, and rags of the
rotten.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftG3</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The verb
means trouble of mind or anxiety rather than fear, &#8220;I am disturbed with
regard to the Jews,&#8221; etc. The <i>Vulgate </i>is, &#8220;I am
solicitous,&#8221; and the <i>Targum., </i>&#8220;I am anxious. Our version,
&#8220;I am afraid of,&#8221; is the <i>Syriac. </i>The king seems to have been
too proud to own that he had fear. The last clause in the verse may be thus
rendered, &#8220;And they exult over me.&#8221; The verb means to raise up or
elevate one&#8217;s self, and then the preposition
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">
means over, or against. The king was disturbed in his mind, being apprehensive
of the taunts and insults of those already gone to the Chaldeans. &#8212;
Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftG4</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Both the
<i>Sept. </i>and the <i>Vulg. </i>take <i>&#8220;fixed&#8221; </i>in a
transitive sense, &#8220;They have fixed&#8221; or caused to sink; and the last
words are made to refer to the princes. As to the <i>Vulg. </i>the two clauses
are, &#8220;They have sunk thy feet in the mire and in a slippery <i>place,
</i>and have departed from thee.&#8221; The <i>Syriac. </i>as to the last clause
is the same.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The whole matter is related as seen in a vision,
given to the Prophet as he says in the previous verse, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">21. This is the thing which Jehovah made
me to see; and (<i>he said</i>)<i> </i>Behold the women, who have remained in
the house of Judah, going forth to the princes of the king of Babylon, and
behold them saying, &#8212; They have roused thee and prevailed over thee,
<i>even </i>thy friends; sunk have they in the mire thy feet, they have run away
from thee.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The scene, as seen in the vision, is presented to the
king, the women going out and then speaking tauntingly to him. The princes
roused or excited Zedekiah to break faith with the king of Babylon, and
prevailed on him to do so. By so doing they sunk him as it were in the mire,
that is, brought him to difficulties, and then ran away from him. And then in
the next verse the Prophet confirms and explains the vision. &#8212;
Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftG5</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And this
city shall be burnt with fire,&#8221; is the rendering of the <i>Sept., </i>the
<i>Syriac., </i>and the <i>Targum. </i>The <i>Vulg. </i>is, &#8220;and he (the
king of Babylon) will burn this city with fire.&#8221; The first, no doubt, is
the true version of the hebrew, except the verb he in <i>Hiphil, </i>according
to our version, and also that of <i>Blayney; </i>but what corresponds best with
the passage is the former rendering. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftG6</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The words

suggests the view taken by <i>Calvin. &#8212; Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftG7</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> These
words are left out in the <i>Sept. </i>and the Syriac. The <i>Vulgate, </i>and
the <i>Targum. </i>give this version, &#8220;And it came to pass that Jerusalem
was taken;&#8221; which seems not in this connection to have any meaning. Some
connect them with the following chapter, but improperly. Our version, followed
by <i>Blayney, </i>gives the best sense, <i>&#8220;And </i>he was <i>there
</i>(that is, in the court of the prison)when Jerusalem was taken: &#8220; He
was there not only <i>to </i>the day or time of its capture, but during that
time. This was added to shew that he was not released by the Jews, but by those
who took the city. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftG8</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The

versions and the <i>Targum. </i>express literally the Hebrew, &#8220;And he
blinded the eyes of Zedekiah.&#8221; And the custom was to hold before them
red-hot iron. It seems also that they practiced in the East the horrible custom
of pulling out the eyes. But to blind the eyes must have been a different form
of barbarity. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>

same with our version. <i>&#8220;Along </i>with Gedaliah,&#8221; is

Gedaliah;&#8221; and this would give the passage the most emphatic meaning:
Ishmael smote them because he envied the power given to Gedaliah, which these
men, by coming to Mizpah, acknowledged and supported. &#8212;

it being in the plural number. <i>Blayney </i>takes it as a proper name. &#8212;

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftG18</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Our
version is, &#8220;to whom we send thee,&#8221; and correctly too: literally it
is, &#8220;whom we send thee to him,&#8221; an idiom common in Hebrew and also
in <i>Welsh, &#8220;yr </i>hwn y danfonwn di atto.&#8221; The <i>Vulg. </i>is,
&#8220;to whom we send thee;&#8221; and so in the <i>Syriac. </i>and <i>Targum.,
</i>but the <i>Septuagint </i>tried to imitate the Hebrew, and there is no sense
given. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftG19</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
phrase often occurs, and has ever this meaning; and it is the meaning here, no
doubt, though the <i>Sept. </i>and the <i>Vulg. </i>adopt the other sense. The
versions often give different senses to the same phrases, which render them
unsafe guides. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftG20</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> All the
versions and the <i>Targum </i>differ as to the <i>construction </i>of these two
verses, the 19th and the 20th, and modern authors too. I offer the following
rendering, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>19. </b>The word of Jehovah to you,
the remnant of Judah, <i>is this, </i>Enter not into Egypt; knowing, know (or,
surely know,) that I make this pro-</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>20.</b> test to you this day. Verily,
ye do go greatly astray against your own selves; for ye sent me to Jehovah your
God, etc., etc.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The first clause is according to the <i>Vulg. </i>The
express message was, not to enter into Egypt. What they were to know and
remember was the protest he made to them. Then in verse 20th, he charges them
with inconsistency, that they went astray from their own professions, and
afterwards he specifies what they had promised. There is, according to this
view, a consistency in the whole passage. The word <i>soul </i>is often taken
for the person: &#8220;against your own selves,&#8221; is literally
&#8220;against your own souls.&#8221; The meaning of the phrase is, that they
belied themselves, as it is evident from what follows. The past tense in Hebrew
may often be rendered by the present, as it refers to time up to the present and
including the present. The future also in Hebrew may be rendered by the present,
because it refers often to what is now and continues to <i>be. &#8212;
Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftG21</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is
rendered by the <i>Sept. and Syr., </i>&#8220;arms;&#8221; by the <i>Vulg.,
</i>&#8220;throne;&#8221; by the <i>Targum., </i>&#8220;tent.&#8221; Strange
that there should be such a difference. It was something to be stretched out or
extended, for such is the meaning of the verb; and it was something beautiful,
for so the word[means. It was probably a canopy erecton over the throne, which
was to be set on <i>the stones. &#8212; Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftG22</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
first verb is rendered in the third person, by the <i>Sept., </i>the <i>Vulg.,
</i>and the <i>Syriac., </i>&#8220;He will kindle;&#8221; but in the first by
the <i>Targum., </i>&#8220;I will kindle.&#8221; The third person runs better
with the context; but if a causative sense be given to the verb, it will be
equally the same, <i>&#8220;And </i>I will cause <i>him </i>to kindle a fire in
the houses of the gods of Egypt, and he will burn them, and carry them away
captive; that is, he will burn the parts made of wood, and carry away the gold
and the silver; &#8220;and he will put on the land of Egypt as the shepherd puts
on his coat,&#8221; that is, he will put on the spoils of the land with the same
ease and facility as the shepherd puts on his coat, and carry them away, no one
molesting or hindering him. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftG23</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
easiest way to reconcile this seeming inconsistency is as follows: He threatens
the fugitives to Egypt with the sword; this sword was that of Nebuchadnezzar, as
he foretells in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;244615&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
46:15, etc. None would escape this sword except those who might have escaped in
the meantime into the land of Judah. We see the same thing referred to in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;244628&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
46:28; and that verse may be thus rendered, &#8212; And those who shall escape
the sword (<i>who </i>shall have returned from the land of Egypt to the land of
Judah) shall be few in number; but all the remnant of Judah, who have gone to
the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know the word, which shall stand,
<i>what is </i>from me or from them. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftG24</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is
more consistent with the passage to render the verbs in the future tense,
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Not flee shall the swift, Nor escape
shall the strong; In the north, by the side of the river Euphrates, Have they
stumbled and fallen. </font><font face="Palatino"><i>&#8212;
Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">ftG25</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
<i>city </i>here is put in opposition to the <i>land, &#8212; </i>And it (Egypt)
said, I will ascend, I will cover the land; I will destroy (every) city, and the
dwellers in it.</font><br></div>
