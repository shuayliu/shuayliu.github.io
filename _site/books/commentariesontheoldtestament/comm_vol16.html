and hearken, ye people, from far; The Lord hath called me from the womb; from
the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name.	<b>1.</b> Audite me,
Insulae, et attendite populi e longinquo. Iehova ex utero vocavit me, e ventre
matris meae habuit in memoria nomen
meum.	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b> And he hath made my mouth like
a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished
shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me;	<b>2.</b> Et posuit os meum quasi gladium
acutum; in umbra manus suae protexit me, et posuit me in sagittam tersam, in
pharetra sua abscondit me.	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b> And said
unto me, Thou <i>art </i>my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be
glorified.	<b>3.</b> Et dixit mihi, Servus meus es, Israel, in to
gloriabor.<b>	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b> Then I said, I have
labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain; <i>yet
</i>surely my judgment <i>is </i>with the Lord, and my work with my
God.	<b>4.</b> Ego autem dixi, Frustra laboravi; inaniter et vane fortitudinem
meam consumpsi. At judicium meum coram Iehova, et opus meum coram Deo
meo.<b>	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b> And now, saith the Lord
that formed me from the wonlb <i>to be </i>his servant, to bring Jacob again to
him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the
Lord, and my God shall be my strength.	<b>5.</b> Et nunc dicit Iehova, qui
formavit me ab utero in servum sibi, ut reducam ad se Iacob. Atque ut Israel non
colligatur, tamen gloriosus ero in oculis Iehovae, et Deus meus erit fortitudo
mea.<b>	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b> And he said, It is a
light thing that thou shouldest be my servant, to raise up the tribes of Jacob,
and to restore the preserved of Israel; I will also give thee for a light to the
Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth. 	<b>6.</b>
Et ait, Leve est ut tu mihi sis servus ad suscitandas tribus Iacob, et
desolationes Israel ut restituas. Itaque constitui to in lucem Gentium, ut sis

whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers,
Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the Lord that
is faithful, <i>and </i>the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose
thee.	<b>7.</b> Sic dicit Iehova redemptor Israel, Sanctus ejus, ad

acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee:

establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages:	<b>8.</b> Sic
dicit Iehova: In tempore placiti exaudivi to, in die salutis auxiliatus sum

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Hear me, O islands! </i></font><font face="Palatino">After having treated of the
future deliverance of the people, he comes down to Christ, under whose guidance
the people were brought out of Babylon, as they had formerly been brought out of
Egypt. The former prophecy must have been confirmed by this doctrine; because
they would scarcely have hoped that the Lord would deliver them, if they had not
placed Christ before their eyes, by whom alone desponding souls can be comforted
and strengthened; for from him they ought not only to expect eternal salvation,
but ought equally to expect temporal deliverance. Besides, it is customary with
the prophets, when they discourse concerning the restoration of the Church, to
bring Christ into view, not only because he would be the minister of the Church,
but because on him was founded the adoption of the people. The Jews also, or, at
least, such of them as have any soundness of understanding, admit that this
passage cannot be understood as relating to any other person than Christ. But
still the train of thought which we have pointed out has not been perceived by
every interpreter; for the Prophet does not, by a sudden transition, mention
Christ, but interweaves this with the former subject, because in no other manner
could the people entertain the hope of deliverance, since on him depended their
reconciliation with God. And in order that the style might be more energetic, he
introduces Christ as speaking, and addresses not only the Jews but nations that
were beyond the sea, and foreign nations who were at a great distance from
Judea, to whom, as we have formerly remarked, 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F845</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he gives the name of
"Islands."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah hath called
me from the womb. </i></font><font face="Palatino">A question arises, What is
the nature of this calling? For, seeing that we were</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"chosen</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">in Christ before the creation of
the
world,"</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ephesians
1:4,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">it follows that election goes before this calling;
for it is the commencement and foundation of our election. Accordingly, it might
be thought that Isaiah says far less than the occasion demands, when he says
that he was "called from the womb;" for he had been called long before. But the
answer is easy; for the subject here treated of is not eternal election, by
which we are adopted to be his sons, but only the appointment or consecration by
which Christ is set apart to that office, that no man may think that he intruded
into it without being duly authorized.
"For</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">no man," as the Apostle
says,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"taketh this honor upon
himself, but he who is called by God, as Aaron was. So also Christ glorified not
himself to be made a high priest, but he who spake to him, Thou art my Son; this
day have I begotten thee."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580504&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Hebrews
5:4, 5.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moreover, the Prophet does not describe
the commencement of the period, as if it were only from the womb that God began
to call him; but it is as if he had said, "Before I came out of the womb, God
had determined that I should hold this office." In like manner Paul also says
that he was "set apart from the womb,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480115&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
1:15,) though he had been "elected before the creation of the world."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
1:4.) To Jeremiah also it is said, "Before thou camest out of the womb, I knew
thee."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
1:5.) In short, the meaning is, that Christ was clothed with our flesh by the
appointment of the Father, in order that he might fulfill the office of
Redeemer, to which he had been
appointed.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From my mother's
belly he hath had my name in remembrance. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This
has the same import as the former clause; for by "the remembrance of the name"
is meant familiar acquaintance. He therefore distinguishes himself from the
ordinary rank of men, because he was elected to an uncommon and remarkable
office.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And he hath placed my mouth as a sharp sword,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">he employs a twofold comparison, that of
"a</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">sword" and of "a
quiver,"</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">in order to denote the power and energy of the
doctrine; and he shews why he was called, and why he was honored by a name so
excellent and illustrious, namely, that he may teach; for this is what he means
by the word "mouth."</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Christ hath therefore been appointed by the
Father, not to rule, after the manner of princes, by the force of arms, and by
surrounding himself with other external defences, to make himself an object of
terror to his people; but his whole authority consists in doctrine, in the
preaching of which he wishes to be sought and acknowledgcd; for nowhere else
will he be found. He asserts the power of his "mouth," that is, of the doctrine
which proceeds from his mouth, by comparing it to
"a</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">sword;"
for</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"the</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">word of God is quick and powerful,
and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of the
soul and the spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the
thoughts and intentions of the heart."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580412&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Hebrews
4:12.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And hath made me as a
polished arrow. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He now compares his mouth to
"an</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">arrow," because it strikes not only close at
hand, but likewise at a distance, and reaches even those who appear to be far
off.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In his quiver hath he hid
me. </i></font><font face="Palatino">After having spoken of the efficacy of
doctrine, Isaiah adds, that God, by his power, protects Christ and his doctrine,
so that nothing can stop his course. And this was very necessary to be added;
for, as soon as the mouth of Christ is opened, that is, as soon as his Gospel is
preached, adversaries rise up on all sides, and innumerable enemies league
together in order to crush it; so that the efficacy which he ascribes to
doctrine would not be sufficient, if there were not added his protection, in
order to drive away adversaries.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Besides, the
present question is not about the person of Christ, but about the whole body of
the Church. We must indeed begin with the Head, but we must next come down to
the members; and to all the ministers of the Word must be applied what is here
affirmed concerning Christ; for to them is given such efficacy of the Word, that
they may not idly beat the air with their voices, but may reach the hearts and
touch them to the quick. The Lord also causes the voice of the Gospel to resound
not; only in one place, but far and wide throughout the whole world. In short,
because he faithfully keeps them under his protection, though they are exposed
to many attacks, and are assaulted on every side by Satan and the world, yet
they do not swerve from their course. We ought to have abundant knowledge of
this from experience; for they would all to a man have been long ago ruined by
the conspiracies and snares of adversaries, if the Lord had not defended them by
his protection. And indeed, amidst so many dangers, it is almost miraculous that
a single preacher of the Gospel is permitted to remain. The reason of this is,
that the Lord guards them by his shadow, and "hides them as arrows in his
quiver," that they may not be laid open to the assaults of enemies and be
destroyed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou
art my servant, O Israel. </i></font><font face="Palatino">It is of great
importance to connect this verse with the preceding, because this shews that the
Prophet now speaks not only of a single man, but of the whole nation; which has
not been duly considered by commentators. This passage must not be limited to
the person of Christ, and ought not to be referred to Israel alone; but on the
present occasion we should attend to the customary language of Scripture. When
the whole body of the Church is spoken of, Christ is brought forward
conspicuously so as to include all the children of God. We hear what Paul
says:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The promises were given
to Abraham and to his seed. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many, but as of
one, And to thy seed, which is Christ."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Galatians
3:16.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He does not include the whole multitude of children
who were descended from Abraham himself according to the flesh, seeing that all
were not partakers of the blessing. Ishmael was rejected, Esau was a reprobate,
and many others were cut off. When the people were rescued from Babylon, but a
small renmant came out; for the greater part rejected God's astonishing
kindness. Where then was "the seed?" In Christ, who is the Head, and contains in
himself the rest of the members; for in him is joined and bound by an
indisoluble bond all the seed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In like manner,
under the name <i>Israel, </i>by which he means Christ, Isaiah includes the
whole body of the people, as members under the Head. Nor ought this to be
thought strange; for Paul also, when he speaks of the union, employs the
metaphor of the human body, and then adds: "So also is Christ."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 12:12.) In that passage the name of Christ is given to Israel, that
is, to the whole body of believers, who are joined to Christ, as members to the
Head. In a word, the Lord honors by this name the Church, which is the spouse of
Christ, just as the wife is honored by bearing the name and title of her
husband. He calls "Israel<i> </i>his <i>servant," </i>that is, he calls the
Church his handmaid, because she is "the pillar and foundation of truth,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;540315&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 3:15; ) for he hath committed his word to the care of the Church, that
by her ministrations it may be published throughout the whole
world.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In thee I will be
glorified. </i></font><font face="Palatino">At length, in the conclusion of the
verse he shews what is the design of these ministrations, and for what purpose,
they who preach the Gospel are called by God; namely, that they may zealously
display his glory, and may likewise promote it among others, which Christ also
teaches us in the Gospel,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Father, glorify thy Son,
that thy Son may glorify thee."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
17:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is a very high honor conferred on poor, feeble
men, when the Lord appoints them, though corrupt and depraved, to promote his
glory; and therefore we ought to be the more encouraged to render to him our
service and obedience. Yet God intends to express something more, that,
notwithstanding the efforts of Satan and all wicked men, the power of God will
be victorious, so that Christ shall triumph gloriously, and the majesty of God
shall shine forth in his
Gospel.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And I said, In vain have I toiled. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet
here brings forward a grievous complaint in the name of the Church, yet in such
a manner that, as we have formerly remarked, we must begin with the Head. Christ
therefore complains along with his members, that it appears as if his labor were
thrown away; for, having formerly pronounced a high and striking commendation on
the power and efficacy of the word which proceedeth out of his mouth, while yet
it scarcely does any good, and the glory which God demands from the ministration
of it does not shine forth, he therefore introduces the Church as complaining
that she spends her labor fruitlessly, because men do not repent at the
preaching of heavenly doctrine.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It was highly
necessary that the Prophet should add this; first, that we may know that the
fruit which he mentioned is not always visible to the eyes of men; for otherwise
we might call in question the truth of the word, and might entertain doubts if
that which is so obstinately rejected by many was the word of God. Secondly, it
was necessary,<i> </i>that we may advance with unshaken firmness, and may commit
our labor to the Lord, who will not permit it to be ultimately unproductive. The
Prophet therefore intended to guard against a dangerous temptation, that we may
not, on account of the obstinacy of men, lose courage in the middle of our
course. And indeed Christ begins with the complaint, for the purpose of
affirming that nothing shall hinder him from executing his office. The meaning
of the words might be more clearly brought out in the following manner: "Though
my labor be unprofitable, and though I have almost exhausted my strength without
doing any good, yet it is enough that God approves of my obedience." Such is
also the import of what he adds,
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But my judgement is
before Jehovah. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Although we do not clearly see
the fruit of our labors, yet we are enjoined to be content on this ground, that
we serve God, to whom our obedience is acceptable. Christ exhorts and encourages
godly teachers to strive earnestly till they rise victorious over this
temptation, and, laying aside the malice of the world, to advance cheerfully in
the discharge of duty, and not to allow their hearts to languish through
weariness. If therefore the Lord be pleased to make trial of our faith and
patience to such an extent that it shall seem as if we wearied ourselves to no
purpose, yet we ought to rely on this testimony of our conscience<i>. </i>And if
we do not enjoy this consolation, at least we are not moved by pure affection,
and do not serve God, but the world and our own ambition. In such temptations,
therefore, we should have recourse to this
sentiment.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet it ought to be observed, that
here Christ and the Church accuse the whole world of ingratitude; for the Church
complains to God in such a manner as to remonstrate with the world, because no
good effect is produced on it by the doctrine of the Gospel, which in itself is
efficacious and powerful. Yet the whole blame rests on the obstinacy and
ingratitude of men, who reject the grace of God offered to them, and of their
own accord choose to perish. Let those persons now go and accuse Christ, who say
that the Gospel yields little fruit, and who defame the doctrine of the word by
wicked slanders, and who throw ridicule on our labors as vain and unprofitable,
and who allege that, on the contrary, they excite men to sedition, and lead them
to sin with less control. Let them consider, I say, with whom they have to do,
and what advantage they gain by their impudence, since men alone ought to bear
the blame, who, as far as lies in their power, render the preaching of the Word
unprofitable.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Godly ministers, who bitterly
lament that men perish so miserably by their own fault, and who sometimes devour
and waste themselves through grief, when they experience so great perversity,
ought to encourage their hearts by this consolation, and not to be alarmed so as
to throw away the shield and spear, though sometimes they imagine that it would
be better for them to do so. Let them consider that they share with Christ in
this cause; for Christ does not speak of himself alone, as we formerly
mentioned, but undertakes the cause of all who faithfully serve him, and, as
their advocate, brings forward an accusation in the name of all. Let them
therefore rely on his protection, and allow him to defend their cause. Let them
appeal, as Paul does, to the day of the Lord,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 4:4,) and let them not heed the calumnies, reproaches, or slanders
of their enemies; for their judgment is with the Lord, and although they be a
hundred times slandered by the world, yet a faithful God will approve and
vindicate the service<i> </i>which they render to
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">On the other hand, let wicked men, and
despisers of the word, and hypocrites, tremble; for when Christ accuses, there
will be no room for defense;<i> </i>and when he condenms, there will be none
that can acquit. We must therefore beware lest the fruit which ought to proceed
from the Gospel should be lost through our fault; for the Lord manifests his
glory in order that we may become disciples of Christ, and may bring forth much
fruit.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And now saith Jehovah. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By this verse he
confirms the former statement, and yields more abundant consolation, by
repeating that calling; and the testimony of conscience, which ought to be
regarded by us as a fortress; for there is nothing that gives us greater
distress and anxiety, than to entertain doubts by whose authority, or by whose
direction everything<i> </i>is undertaken by us. For this reason Isaiah reminds
us of the certainty of our
calling.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who formed me from
the womb to be his servant. </i></font><font face="Palatino">In the first place,
godly teachers, along with Christ who is their Prince, say that they have been
"formed" by a divine hand; because God always enriches and adorns with necessary
gifts those whom he calls to the office of teaching, who derive from the one
fountain of the Spirit all the gifts in which they excel. Thus "the Father hath
sealed"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430627&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
6:27) his Only-begotten Son, and next prepares others, according to their
degree, to be fit for discharging their office. At the same time, he points out
the end of the calling; for to this end have Apostles and teachers of the Church
been appointed, to gather the Lord's scattered flock, that under Christ we may
all be united in the same body.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:11, 13.) In the world there is miserable dispersion, but in Christ there is
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnakefalai&gt;wsiv</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>"a gathering together" of all,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
1:10,) as the Apostle speaks; for there can be no other bond of union. As to the
word "create," or "form,"<i> </i>it is to no purpose that some men speculate
about it as relating to Christ's human existence, which was created; for it is
clearer than noon-day, that the "forming" must be viewed as relating to
office.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And though Israel be
not gathered. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The Jews read these words as a
question: "Shall I not bring back Jacob? and shall Israel not be gathered?" and
supply the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>ha</i>). But that reading is excessively unnatural, and the Jews do not
consider what was the Prophet's meaning, but, so far as lies in their power,
corrupt the text, in order to conceal the disgrace of their nation. Some explain
it, "Shall<i> </i>not be lost," or, "Shall not perish;" for the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">psa</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>(asaph) </i>sometimes denotes what we commonly call <i>(trousser) to truss.
</i>Those things which are intended to be preserved are "gathered," and likewise
those things which are intended to be consumed; and accordingly, when we mean
that any person has been removed out of the world, we frequently use the vulgar
phrase, "he<i> </i>is trussed," 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F846</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
or, "he<i> </i>is
despatched."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yet I shall be
glorious. </i></font><font face="Palatino">To suppose the meaning to be, "I have
been sent, that Israel may not perish," would not be unsuitable; but I choose
rather to follow a different interpretation, namely, "Though<i> </i>Israel be
not gathered, yet I shall be glorious;" for it is probable that opposite things
are contrasted with each other in this passage. If ministers have been set
apart, for the salvation of men, it is glorious to them when many are brought to
salvation; and when the contrary happens:, it tends to their shame and disgrace.
Paul calls those whom he had gained to Christ "his<i> </i>glory and crown."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;500401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
4:1;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;520219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Thessalonians 2:19.) On the other hand, when men perish, we receive from it
nothing but shame and disgrace; for God appears to curse our labors, and not to
deign to bestow on us the high honor of advancing his kingdom by our agency. But
the Prophet declares that those who have served Christ shall nevertheless be
glorious; for he speaks both of the head and of the members, as we have formerly
remarked. Although therefore Israel refuse to be "gathered,"<i> </i>yet the
ministry of Christ shall retain its glory unimpaired; for it will be ascribed to
the baseness and wickedness of men, that they have not been
"gathered."</font><br><font face="Palatino">In like manner, although the
preachers of the Gospel be "the savor of death unto death" to the reprobate, yet
Paul declares that they have a sweet and delightful odor before God, who
determines that wicked men shall thus be rendered the more inexcusable. God is
indeed doubly glorified if success corresponds to their wishes; but when the
ministers of the word have left nothing undone, though they have good reason to
lament that their labor is unprofitable, still they must not repent of having
pleased God, whose approbation is here contrasted with the perverse judgments of
the whole world. As if the Prophet had said, "Though men vehemently slander and
load them with many reproaches, yet this ought to be calmly and patiently
endured by them; because God judges differently, and bestows a crown of honor on
their patience, which wicked men insolently
slander.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And my God shall be
my strength. </i></font><font face="Palatino">When he says that it is enough
that "God is their strength," the meaning corresponds to what goes before, that
they ought not to be terrified by the multitude or power of their enemies,
seeing that they are persuaded that their
"strength"</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">lies in
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And he said, It is a small matter. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
proceeds still farther, and shews that the labor of Christ, and of the whole
Church, will be glorious not only before God, but likewise before men. Although
at first it appears to be vain and useless, yet the Lord will cause some fruit
to spring from it contrary to the expectations of men. Already it was enough
that our labor should be approved by God; but when he adds that it will not be
unprofitable even in the eyes of men, this ought still more abundantly to
comfort, and more vehemently to excite us. Hence it follows, that we ought to
have good hopes of success, but that we ought to leave it to the disposal of God
himself, that the blessing which he promises may be made manifest at the proper
time, to whatever extent, and in whatever manner he shall think
proper.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore I have
appointed thee to be a light of the Gentiles.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He now adds, that this labor will be
efficacious, not only among the people of Israel, but likewise among the
Gentiles; and so it actually happened. Moreover, when the preaching of the
Gospel produced hardly any good effect on the Jews, and when Christ was
obstinately rejected by them, the Gentiles were substituted in their room. And
thus Christ was</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"appointed</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">to be a light of the Gentiles, and
his salvation was manifested to the very ends of the earth."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;441347&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Acts
13:47.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this consolation was highly necessary, both for
prophets and for apostles, who experienced more and more the obstinacy of the
Jews. They might doubt the truth of these promises, since they did not perceive
them to yield any fruit; but when they understood that Christ was sent to the
Gentiles also, it was not so difficult to animate their hearts to persevere.
This was incredible, and even monstrous; but this is the manner in which the
Lord commonly works, contrary to the expectation of all. Paul says that this was
"a</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">mystery bidden from ages," and that the angels
themselves did not understand it until it was actually revealed in the Church of
God.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
3:5.) Although therefore the Jews alone appeared to have discernment, they are
now placed on a level with the Gentiles, and with God "there is no distinction
between the Jews and the Greeks."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:12.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Jews read this verse as a question,
"Is it a small thing?" As if he had said, that it is enough, and that nothing
more or greater ought to be desired. But they maliciously corrupt the natural
meaning of the Prophet, and imagine that they will one day be lords of the
Gentiles, and will have wide and extensive dominion. The true meaning of the
Prophet is, "This work in itself indeed is magnificent and glorious, to raise up
and restore the tribes of Israel, which had fallen very low; for he will add the
Gentiles to the Jews, that they may be united as one people, and may be
acknowledged to belong to Christ." Nor does this passage relate to the rejection
of the ancient people, but to the increase of the Church, that the Gentiles may
be associated with the Jews. It is true, indeed, that when the Jews revolted
from the covenant, the Gentiles entered, as it were, into that place which they
had left vacant; and thus their revolt was the reason why those who had formerly
been aliens were admitted to be sons. But in this, as well as in other passages,
Isaiah foretells that the Church will be greatly extended, when the Gentiles
shall be received and united to the Jews in the unity of
faith.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A light of the
Gentiles. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Although by the word
"light"</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">is meant happiness, or joy, yet the Prophet, I
have no doubt, directly refers to the doctrine of the Gospel, which enlightens
souls, and draws them out of darkness, He shews that this "light," which Christ
shall bring, will give salvation. In the same manner as Christ is called "the
way, the truth, and the life,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
14:6) because through the knowledge of the truth we obtain life, so in this
passage he is called the "light" and salvation of the Gentiles, because he
enlightens our minds by the doctrine of the Gospel, in order that he may lead us
to salvation. Two things, therefore, ought to be remarked; first, that our eyes
are opened by the doctrine of Christ; and secondly, that we who had perished are
restored to life, or rather life is restored to
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Thus saith Jehovah. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Isaiah pursues the same
subject, that the people, when they were afflicted by that terrible calamity,
might cherish the hope of a better condition; and, in order to confirm it the
more, he calls God, who promised these things,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Redeemer and the Holy One of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It will be objected that these
statements are contradictory, that is, that God is called the "redeemer" of that
people which he permitted to be oppressed; for where is this redemption, and
where is this sanctification, if the people could reply that they were miserable
and ruined? I reply, the record of ancient history is here exhibited as the
ground of confidence and hope; for when the Jews were on the point of despair,
the Prophet comes forward and reminds them that God, who had formerly redeemed
their fathers, is still as powerful as ever; and therefore, although for a time,
in order to exercise the faith of the godly, he concealed their salvation,
believers are commanded to stand firm, because in his hand their redemption is
certain. Yet it was proper that they should form conceptions of that which lay
far beyond human senses. This is a remarkable passage, from which we learn how
firmly we ought to believe God when he speaks, though he does not immediately
perform what he has promised, but permits us to languish, and to be afflicted
for a long time.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the

It heightens the wretchedness of that nation, that "in the soul," that is, in
their own estimation, they are "contemptible." Many are despised by others,
though they either deserve honor on account of their good qualities, or do not
cease to swell with pride, and to tread down the arrogance of others by still
greater arrogance. But of this people the Prophet says, that they despise
themselves as much as others despise them. He therefore describes deep disgrace
and a very unhappy condition, and, at the same time, prostration of mind, that
they may know that God's time for rendering assistance will be fully come, when
they shall be altogether
humbled.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the abhorred
nation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F848</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>I see no reason why the plural "Nations," is here employed by some
interpreters; seeing that the singular
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ywg</font><font face="Palatino">,

specially directed to the posterity of
Abraham.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the servant of
rulers. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This is added, as if he had said that
they are oppressed by strong tyrants; for he gives the appellation
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yl&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
(moshelim) </i>to those whose strength and power are so great that it is not
easy to escape out of their hands.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he says
that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>kings shall
see</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he speaks in lofty terms of the
deliverance of his nation; but yet he permits them to be put to the test in the
fumace, that he may make trial of their faith and patience; for otherwise there
would be no trial of their faith, if he immediately performed what he promised,
as we have already said. The word <i>princes </i>contains a repetition which is
customary among the Hebrews. We would express it thus: "Kings<i> </i>and princes
shall see; they shall rise up: and adore." By the word <i>adore, </i>he explains
what he had said, "They<i> </i>shall rise up; " for we "rise<i> </i>up" for the
purpose of shewing respect. The general meaning is, that the most exalted
princes of the world shall be aroused to perceive that the restoration of the
nation is an illustrious work of God, and worthy of
reverence.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For faithful is the
Holy One of Israel. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This is the reason of the
great admiration and honor which the princes shall render to God. It is because
they shall perceive the "faithfulness" and constancy of the Lord in his
promises. Now, the Lord wishes to be acknowledged<i> </i>to be true, not by a
bare and naked imagination, but by actual experience, that is, by preserving the
people whom he has adopted. Let us therefore learn from it, that we ougtlt not
to judge of the promises of God from our condition, but from his truth; so that,
when we shall see nothing before us but destruction and death, we may remember
this sentiment, by which the Lord calls to himself the contemptible and
abominable.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence also it ought to be observed,
how splendid and astonishing a work of God is the deliverance of the Church,
which compels kings, though proud, and deeming hardly anything so valuable as to
be worthy of their notice, to behold, admire, and be amazed, and even in spite
of themselves to reverence the Lord. This strange and extraordinary work,
therefore, is highly commended to us. How great and how excellent it is, we may
learn from ourselves; for to say nothing about ancient histories, in what manner
have we been redeemed from the wretched tyranny of Antichrist? Truly we shall
consider it to be "a dream," as the Psalmist says,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19C601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
126:1,) if we ponder it carefully for a short time; so strange and incredible is
the work which God hath performed in us who have possessed the name of
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And who hath chosen
thee. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He now repeats what he had formerly
glanced at, that this nation has been set apart to God. But in election we
perceive the beginning of sanctification; for it was in consequence of God
having deigned to elect them out of his mere good pleasure, that this nation
became his peculiar inheritance. Isaiah therefore points out the secret will of
God, from which sanctification proceeds; that Israel might not think that he had
been selected on account of his own merits. As if he had said, "The Lord, who
hath chosen thee, gives actual proof of his election, and shows it by the
effect." In the same manner, therefore, as the truth of God ought to be
acknowledged in our salvation, so salvation ought to be ascribed exclusively to
his election, which is of free grace. Yet they who wish to become partakers of
so great a benefit, must be a part of Israel, that is, of the Church, out of
which there can be neither salvation nor
truth.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
In a time of good pleasure. </i></font><font face="Palatino">From this verse we
again learn more clearly what we explained at the beginning of this chapter,
that the Prophet, while he addresses the whole body of the Church, begins with
Christ, who is the head. I have said that this ought to be cardully observed;
for commentators lmve not attended to it, and yet there is no other way in which
this chapter can be consistently expounded. This is clearly shewn by Paul, who
applies this statement to the whole Church.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 6:2.) And yet, what the Prophet adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will give thee to be a
covenant,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is applicable to no other than
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino">How shall we reconcile these statements?
By considering that Christ is not so much his own as ours; for he neither came,
nor died, nor rose again for himself. He was sent for the salvation of the
Church, and seeks nothing as his own; for he has no want of anything.
Accordingly, God makes promises to the whole body of the Church. Christ, who
occupies the place of Mediator, receives these promises, and does not plead on
behalf of himself as an individual, but of the whole Church, for whose salvation
he was sent. On this account he does not address Christ separately, but so far
as he is joined and continually united to his body. It is an inconceivable honor
which our heavenly Father bestows upon us, when he listens to his Son on our
account, and when he even directs the discourse to the Son, while the matter
relates to our salvation. Hence we see how close is the connection between us
and Christ. He stands in our room, and has nothing separate from us; and the
Father listens to our cause.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By<i> </i>the word
"good pleasure," the Prophet lays a bridle on believers, so to speak, that they
may not be too eager in their desires, but may wait patiently till the time
appointed by God has arrived; and in this sense Paul gives to the coming of
Christ the appellation of "the time of fullness."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
4:4.) He means, therefore, that they depend on God's disposal, and ought
therefore to endure his wrath with meekness and composure. But although the
intention of the Prophet is to exhort the godly to patience, that they may learn
to place their feelings in subordination to God, yet at the same time he shows
that our salvation proceeds from God's undeserved kindness.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wxr</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>(ratzon) </i>which the Greeks translate
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eujdoki&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that is, the good-will of God is the foundation of our salvation; and
salvation is the effect of that grace. We are saved, because we please God, not
through our worthiness or merits, but by his free grace. Secondly, he shows, at
the same time, that our salvation is certain, when we have a clear proof of the
grace of the Lord. All doubt ought to be removed, when the Lord testified of his
"good<i> </i>pleasure." This passage tends to the commendation of the word,
beyond which we ought not to inquire about salvation; as Paul declares that the
good pleasure of God is clearly manifested in the preaching of the Gospel, and
that thus is fulfilled what is contained in this passage about "the<i> </i>day
of salvation."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 6:2.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Thirdly, the Prophet intended
to remind us, that God gives us an undoubted pledge of his favor when he sends
the Gospel to us; because it is evident that he has compassion upon us, when he
gently invites us to himself, that we may not look around in every direction to
seek this light, which ought to be expected only from God's gracious pleasure,
or be tortured by doubt, from which God frees us. But let us remember that all
this depends on God's free purpose. When therefore the question is put, why the
Lord enlightened us at this time rather than at an earlier period, the reason
which ought to be assigned is this: because thus it pleased God, thus it seemed
good in his sight. Such is the conclusion to which Paul comes in the passage
which we quoted,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Behold, now is the
accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Corinthians 6:2.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage may greatly aid us in ascertaining
Isaiah's meaning, that we may learn to connect our salvation with God's good
pleasure; a proof of which is given to us in the preaching of the Gospel. It
ought also to be observed, that these predictions should not be limited to a
certain age, since they belong to the whole Church in all ages. For if we begin
with the deliverance from Babylon, we must go on to the redemption of Christ, of
which it might be regarded as the commencement and the forerunner; and since
there are still found among us many remnants of slavery, we must proceed forward
to the last day, when everything shall be
restored.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have appointed
thee to be a covenant. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This makes it still more
evident, that all that had formerly been said was promised to Christ, not for
the sake of his personal advantage, but on our behalf; for he has been appointed
to be the mediator of the covenant, because the Jews by their sins had revolted
from God, who had made an everlasting covenant with them. The renewal of that
covenant, therefore, which had been broken or dissolved, is ascribed to Christ.
Yet we must likewise keep in view the saying of Paul, that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Christ</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">is our peace, to reconcile both
them that are far off, and them that are near."

2:14, 17.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But, Isaiah had directly in view that lamentable
ruin, the remedy for which could be expected from Christ alone. Besides, it is
proper to apply this grace to ourselves, because, as compared to the Jews,
before the Gospel was preached, we were enemies and aliens from God, and could
not in any other way be reconciled to him. Christ was therefore "given to be a
covenant of the people," because there was no other way to God but by him. At
that time the Jews were a people; but in consequence of the partition-wall
having been broken down, all of us, both Jews and Gentiles, have been united in
one body.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That thou mayest
raise up the earth, </i></font><font face="Palatino">which at that time was
waste and desolate; for the return of the people was, as we have elsewhere seen,
a kind of new creation. Such is also the design of the words of the Prophet,
that we may know that there is nothing in the world but ruin and desolation.
Christ is sent in order to restore what was fallen down and decayed. If we had
not been in a fallen condition, there would have been no reason why Christ
should be sent to us. We ought therefore to weigh well our condition; for we are
aliens from God, destitute of life, and shut out from all hope of salvation. But
by Christ we are fully restored and reconciled to our Heavenly Father. Isaiah
likewise adds the benefits which we obtain through Christ, after having been
reconciled to
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
That thou mayest say to them that are bound.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">These words describe the change which took
place at the coming of Christ. And yet the Prophet unquestionably intends to
administer consolation to the Jews in their extremity, that they may not think
it incredible that they shall be restored to a better condition, because they
see that they are almost devoted to destruction. Still, he shows in general what
is the nature of Christ's office, and explains what is meant by <i>restoring
desolate heritages; </i>for, before the coming of Christ, we are "bound"<i>
</i>under a miserable yoke, and plunged in darkness. By these metaphors is
meant, that so long as we are without Christ, we are overwhelmed by a load of
all evils; for by <i>darkness </i>he excludes everything that relates to the
kingdom of Christ, faith, righteousness, truth, innocence, and everything of
that nature. We are therefore in "darkness," till Christ say,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shew
yourselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We are "bound," till he say,
<i>Come forth.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rmal</font><font face="Palatino">,
(lemor,) "that thou mayest say," is highly emphatic; for it shews that the
preaching of the Gospel is the means by which we are delivered. If therefore we
desire liberty, if we desire the light of the kingdom of God, let us listen to
Christ when he speaks; otherwise we shall be oppressed by the unceasing tyranny
of Satan. Where then is the liberty of our will? Whosoever claims for himself
light, or reason, or understanding, can have no share in this deliverance of
Christ; for liberty is not promised to any but those who acknowledge that they
are captives, and light and salvation are not promised to any but those who
acknowledge that they are plunged in
darkness.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On the ways they
shall feed. </i></font><font face="Palatino">When he promises that pastures
shall be accessible to the children of God, and shall be on the tops of the
mountains, by these metaphors he declares that all who shall be under the
protection of Christ shall dwell safely; for he is a careful and attentive
Shepherd, who supplies his flock with everything that is necessary, so that they
are in want of nothing that is requisite for the highest happiness.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431011&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
10:11.) This instruction was highly necessary at the time when the Jews were
about to perform a joumey through dry and barren countries, in their return to a
land which lay waste and desolate. The Prophet therefore says that God has
abundant resources for supplying their wants, though earthly means should fail;
and accordingly, in accordance with the ordinary custom of Scripture, he
compares believers to sheep, in order that, being aware of their weakness, they
may shrink themselves entirely to the care of the
Shepherd.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet it is probable that indirectly he
warns believers not to desire excessive luxury, because they will never have so
great a superfluity as not to be attended by many difficulties; and likewise not
to become effeminate, because they will be beset by dangers; for we know that
"the ways" are exposed to the attacks of enemies and robbers, and that the tops
of mountains are for the most part barren. The Church is governed by Christ in
such a manner as not to be free from the attacks and insults of men, and is fed
in such a manner as frequently to inhabit barren and frightful regions. But
though enemies are at hand, God protects us from their violence and oppression.
If we are thirsty or hungry, he is abundantly able to supply everything that is
necessary for food and maintenance; and amidst perils and difficulties of this
nature we perceive his care and anxiety more dearly than if we were placed
beyond the reach of all danger.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall not hunger or thirst.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He confirms what was said in the former verse,
that there is food in the hand of God, so that the Jews shall not be in want of
provisions for their joumey. Nor can it be doubted that he calls to their
remembrance, that when their fathers were threatened with death in the
wilderness through a scarcity of bread and of every kind of food, God gave them
daily, for forty years, manna from heaven.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021635&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
16:35.) In like manner, when he immediately afterwards speaks of a shadow
against <i>the heat of the sun, </i>he alludes to the history related by Moses
about "the pillar of a cloud," by which God protected his people from being
scorched by the buming rays of the sun.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021321&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
13:21.) We have said that it is customary with the prophets to mention the
departure of the people out of Egypt, whenever they intend to demonstrate the
kindness of God, either publicly towards all, or privately towards any
individual.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By the fountains
of waters. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He likewise alludes to those waters
which flowed from the rock,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021706&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
17:6,) when the people had well-nigh perished from thirst; for those occurrences
did not take place at the deliverance from Babylon, but, by mentioning former
benefits, the Prophet magnifies the power of God in securing the safety of the
Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>And I will place all my mountains.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Here he directly and expressly treats of the
return of the people; for in vain would he have promised so great happiness to
the Church, if the people were not to be restored to their former liberty. The
meaning is, that he will remove every obstacle and hinderance that might prevent
the return of the people; and that he will render the "mountains" passable,
which appeared to be impassable; and, in short, that he will level both the
mountains and the valleys, that their return to Judea may be facilitated. Thus,
when the Church is about to be completely restored, no obstructions, however
great and formidable, can hinder God from being finally victorious. Besides,
when he calls them "my mountains," he not only means that he has an absolute
right to command them to afford a passage to his people, but declares that he
will be the leader of the expedition, as if he would march along with the Jews,
and accompany them in the joumey. In like manner, it is said in another passage,
that he passed through Egypt and "rode<i> </i>on the high places of it" at the
departure of his people.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;053213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
32:13.) But here he describes the extraordinary love of God towards the Church,
when he says that he travels along with her, and undertakes to supply all her
wants, as if he were consulting his own interests when he assisted his
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, those from afar shall
come. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The opinion entertained by some, that the
four quarters of the earth are here denoted, does not rest on very solid
grounds; yet I do not reject it, because it not only is probable, but agrees
with many other passages. Undoubtedly, he first says that they shall come from
distant parts of the world, and next adds certain subdivisions or parts in order
to explain this general
statement.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And those from the
land of Sinis. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Instead of "Sinis," some read
"Sinis;" and indeed the Hebrew copies differ. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F849</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Jerome thinks (and this is the commonly received opinion) that a southern region
is so denominated from Mount Sinai, which lay toward the south. Others think
that "Syene" is meant, because it lies under the tropic of Cancer. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F850</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But this diversity has nothing to do with the meaning of the Prophet, which of
itself is clear and easy to be understood; for the Prophet unquestionably means
those who had been scattered and dispersed in various places, whether they are
collected from the north or from the sea. While Isaiah promises a return from
Babylon, he at the same time extends this prediction to the time of Christ, as
may be easily learned from what goes before; for we must keep in remembrance
what we formerly said, that the second birth of the Church is here described.
Not only does he promise that the
Jews</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">shall return to Jerusalem to build the temple,
but likewise that they who had formerly been aliens from the Church, shall be
collected from every corner of the
world.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Praise, O heavens; and rejoice, O
earth. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Though he exhorts and encourages all the
godly to thanksgiving, yet he likewise aims at confirming the promise which
might have been regarded as doubtful; for afflictions trouble our consciences,
and cause them to waver in such a manner that it is not so easy to rest firmly
on the promises of God. In short, men either remain in suspense, or tremble, or
utterly fall and even faint. So long as they are oppressed by fear or anxiety,
or grief, they scarcely accept of any consolation; and therefore they need to be
confirmed in various ways. This is the reason why Isaiah describes the
advantages of this deliverance in such lofty terms, in order that believers,
though they beheld nothing around them but death and ruin, might sustain their
heart by the hope of a better condition. Accordingly, he places the subject
almost before their eye, that they may be fully convinced that they shall have
the most abundant cause of rejoicing; though at that time they saw nothing but
grief and sorrow.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Let us therefore remember,
that whenever the Lord promises anything, we ought to add thanksgiving, that we
may more powerfully affect our hearts; and next, that we ought to raise our
minds to the power of God, who exercises a wide and extensive dominion over all
the creatures; for as soon as he lifts his hand, "heaven and earth"<i> </i>are
moved. If the tokens of his wonderful power are to be seen everywhere, he
intends that there shall be an eminent and remarkable example of it in the
salvation of the Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
he wilt have compassion on his poor. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By this
metaphor the Prophet shews that no obedience which is rendered to God by heaven
and earth is more acceptable to him than to join together and lend their mutual
aid to his Church. Moreover, that believers may not faint under the weight of
distresses, before promising to them consolation from God, he exhorts them
calmly to bear distresses; for by the word <i>poor </i>he means that the Church,
in this world, is liable to many calamities. In order, therefore, that we may
partake of the compassion of God, let us learn, under the cross and amidst many
annoyances, to strive after it with sighs and
tears.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>But Zion said, Jehovah hath forsaken me.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">In order to magnify his grace the more, God
complains that the hearts of the Jews were so narrow and close, that the road
was almost shut against him, if he had not overcome their wicked thoughts by his
great goodness. Yet at the same time he endeavors to correct this fault, that
the deliverance which is offered, and, as it were, set before them, may be
received by them with open hearts, and that, as he is willing to assist them, so
they, on the other hand, may be prepared to cherish favorable hopes. Now, to us
also this doctrine belongs; because almost all of us, when God delays his
assistance, are fearfully distressed and tormented; for we think that he has
forsaken and rejected us. Thus despair quickly creeps in, which must be opposed,
that we may not be deprived of the grace of God. And indeed amidst these doubts
our unbelief is manifested and exposed, by our not relying on the promises of
God, so as to bear patiently either the chastisements by which God urges us to
repentance, or the trials of faith by which he trains us to patience, or any
afflictions by which he humbles us. Justly therefore does God remonstrate with
the Jews for rejecting by wicked distrust the salvation offered to them, and not
permitting themselves to receive assistance. Nor does he limit this accusation
to a small number, but includes nearly the whole Church, in order to shew that
he will be kind and bountiful toward the Jews beyond the measure of their faith,
and that he even strives with them, that by his salvation he may break through
all the hinderances by which they opposed him. Let each of us therefore beware
of indulging or flattering ourselves in this matter; for the Lord contends with
the whole Church, for uttering speeches of this kind, which proceed from the
fountain of
distrust.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>Shall a woman forget her child! </i></font><font face="Palatino">In
order to correct that distrust, he adds to the remonstrance an exhortation full
of the sweetest consolation. By an appropriate comparison, he shews how strong
is his anxiety about his people, comparing himself to a mother, whose love
toward her offspring is so strong and ardent, as to leave far behind it a
father's love. Thus he did not satisfy himself with proposing the example of a
father, (which on other occasions he very frequently employs,) but in order to
express his very strong affection, he chose to liken himself to a mother, and
calls them not merely "children,"<i> </i>but <i>the fruit of the womb,
</i>towards which there is usually a warmer affection. What amazing affection
does a mother feel toward her offspring, which she cherishes in her bosom,
suckles on her breast, and watches over with tender care, so that she passes
sleepless nights, wears herself out by continued anxiety, and forgets herself!
And this carefulness is manifested, not only among men, but even among savage
beasts, which, though they are by nature cruel, yet in this respect are
gentle.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Even if they shall
forget. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Since it does sometimes happen that
mothers degenerate into such monsters as to exceed in cruelty the wild beasts
and forget "the</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">fruit of their womb," the Lord next declares
that, even though this should happen, still he will never forget his people. The
affection which he bears toward us is far stronger and warmer than the love of
all mothers. We ought also to bear in mind the saying of
Christ,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"If</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">ye, being evil, know how to give

<div><font face="Palatino">Men, though by nature depraved and addicted to
self-love, are anxious about their children. What shall God do, who is goodness
itself? Will it be possible for him to lay aside a father's love? Certainly not.
Although therefore it should happen that mothers (which is a monstrous thing)
should forsake their own offspring, yet God, whose love toward his people is
constant and unremitting, will never forsake them. In a word, the Prophet here
describes to us the inconceivable</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">carefulness with which God unceasingly watches
over our salvation, that we may be fully convinced that he will never forsake
us, though we may be afflicted with great and numerous
calamities.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, on the palms of my
hands. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By another cormparison he describes that
inconceivable carefulness which the Lord exercises toward us. It is a common
proverb, that "we</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">have it on our fingers' ends," when we have
anything fully and deeply fixed on our memory. And Moses when he recommends
constant meditation on the Law, says,
"Thou</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">shalt bind them for a sign on thy hand;" that
is, that they should always have the commandments of God placed before their
eyes.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050608&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
6:8.) He now makes use of the same comparison; as if he had said, "I cannot look
at my hands without beholding thee in them; I carry thee engraved on my heart,
so that no forgetfulness can efface thee; in a word, I cannot forget thee
without forgetting myself." True, indeed, God has neither hands nor bodily
shape; but Scripture accommodates itself to our weak capacity so as to express
the strength of God's love toward
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy walls are continually

term "walls,"</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

the Church; as if he had said that he would take care that Jerusalem should
thrive and flourish. Yet it ought to be observed that the term
"walls"</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">denotes proper order of policy and discipline,
of which God declares that he will be the ceaseless and unwearied guardian. Let
us remember that this prophecy was accomplished during that frightful
desolation, when the "walls" of Jerusalem, which were a lively image of the
Church, had been cast down, the temple overthrown, and government overtumed,
and, in a word, when everything had been destroyed and nearly razed to the
foundation; for immediately afterwards he promises that they shall all be
restored.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>Thy builders hasten. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He affirms what
had been briefly stated in the former verse; for it might have been thought that
there was no ground for what he had now asserted about the unceasing care which
God takes of his Church and of her walls, which he permits to be razed to their
foundations, and therefore he adds the explanation, that it will indeed be
thrown down, but will afterwards be built anew. <i>Builders. </i>From this word
we may learn what is the true method of restoring the Church, namely, if the
Lord send "builders, 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F851</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>to rear it, and next if he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>drive far away the
destroyers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>who demolish it. Though God
could, by himself, and without the aid of men, rebuild the Church, yet he deigns
to employ their hands; and although he alone, by the secret influence of his
Spirit, completes this whole building, yet he blesses their labor, that it may
not be useless. From him, therefore, we ought to ask and look for builders; for
it belongs to him to render them "sufficient,"<i> </i>as Paul also informs us,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 3:5,) and to assign to each<i> </i>his
department.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We ought also to pray not only that
he may "send<i> </i>forth laborers into his harvest,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400938&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
9:38,) but that he may recruit their strength and efficaciously direct them, so
that they may not labor in vain; for, when the doctrine of the Gospel is
preached with any advantage, it arises from his extraordinary goodness. But even
this would not be enough, if he did not "drive destroyers far away;" for Satan,
by innumerable arts, invades and assails the Church, and is in no want of
servants and attendants, who direct their whole energy to destroy, or spoil, or
hinder the Lord's building. We ought, therefore, constantly to entreat that he
would ward off their attacks; and if the result be not entirely according to our
expectations, let us blame our own sins and ingratitude; for the Lord was ready
to bestow those blessings abundantly upon
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lift up thine eyes round
about. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He arouses the Church to survey this
magnificent work, as if it were actually before her eyes, and to behold the
multitudes of men who shall flock into it from every quarter. Now, as this
assemblage must have encouraged godly hearts during the dispersion, so they who
were eye-witnesses must have been excited to gratitude. This shews clearly that
this prediction was useful at both periods, not only while the event was still
concealed by hope, but when it had been actually accomplished. Though he speaks
to the whole Church at large, yet this discourse relates also to individuals,
that all with one accord, and each person separately, may embrace these
promises.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he bids them "lift<i> </i>up
their eyes," he means that the reason why we are so much cast down is, that we
do not examine the Lord's work with due attention, but have a vail placed, as it
were, before our eyes, to hinder us from seeing what lies at our feet. In
consequence of this, we do not cherish any confidence, but in adversity are
almost overwhelmed by despair. And if these things are said to the whole Church,
let every man consider in his own heart how far he is chargeable with this vice,
and let him forthwith arouse and awaken himself to behold the works of the Lord,
that he may rely with all his heart on his
promises.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All are gathered
together. </i></font><font face="Palatino">When he says that the elect of the
Church are "gathered<i> </i>together," he means that, in order to their becoming
one body under Christ, and, as it were, "one fold under one shepherd,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431016&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
10:16,) they must be, if we may so express it, "gathered" into one bosom. Christ
reckons and treats as his followers none but those who are joined in one body by
unity of faith. Whoever then shall choose to be regarded as belonging to the
number of the children of God, let him be a son of the Church; for all who are
separated from it will be aliens from
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt be clothed as
with an ornament. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet shews what is the
true ornament of the Church, namely, to have a great number of children, who are
brought to her by faith and guided by the Spirit of God. This is true splendor;
this is the glory of the Church, which must be filthy and ugly, ragged and
dishevelled, if she have not these ornaments. Hence we see how well the Papists
understand what is the true manner in which the Church ought to be adorned; for
their whole attention is given to painted tables, to statues, to fine buildings,
to gold, precious stones, and costly garments; that is, they give their whole
attention to puppets, like children. But the true dignity of the Church is
internal, so far as it consists of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and of
progressive faith and piety. Hence it follows, that she is richly provided with
her ornaments, when the people, joined together by faith, are gathered into her
bosom, to worship God in a proper
manner.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I live, saith

the Lord employs an oath, which is intended to warn us against distrust, and
that, when we shall consider that her end is near, we may be certain that she
shall be fully restored. And if this doctrine was ever necessary, it is
especially necessary at the present time; for, wherever we tum our eyes, we meet
with nothing but frightful desolation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What then
must we do, but, relying on this oath of God, struggle against despair, and not
be terrified by our being inconsiderable in number, which makes us despised by
the world, and not doubt that there are many of the elect, now wandering and
scattered, whom God will at length assemble into his Church? And therefore we
ought to encourage our hearts, and to lift up our eyes by faith, that we may
extend our hope not only to a single age, but to the most distant
period.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>For thy desolate places, </i></font><font face="Palatino">he confirms
by other words what we have already seen, that the change which he promised is
in the hand of God, that the Church, which was for a long time waste and
desolate, may speedily have many inhabitants; so that the place may be too
narrow to contain them all. He employs the metaphor of a ruinous city, whose
walls and houses are rebuilt, to which the citizens return in such vast numbers
that its circumference</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">must be enlarged, because its former extent
cannot contain them all. Thus he means not only the return of the people from
Babylon, but the restoration which was effected through Christ; that is, when
the Church was spread far and wide, not only throughout Judea, but throughout
the whole world.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thy
destroyers shall remove far away. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He adds that
a garrison will be provided, if any enemies shall molest her; yea, that she
shall be secure against their attacks and molestation, because God will "drive
them far away."</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Not that the Church shall ever enjoy perfect
peace, and be secured against all the attacks of enemies; but yet God, bearing
with the weakness of his people, defended them from wicked men, and restrained
or warded off their attacks, so that at least the kingdom of Satan might not
grow out of the ruins of the Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall again say in thine
ears. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Isaiah continues the same subject, and,
under a different metaphor, promises the restoration of the Church. He compares
her to a widowed or rather a barren mother, in order to describe her wretched
and distressful condition; for she was overwhelmed by so many distresses, that
the remembrance of the nation appeared to have wholly perished. Mingled with the
Babylonians,who held her captive, she had almost passed into another body. We
need not wonder, therefore, if he compares her to a barren mother; for she
brought forth no more children. Formerly the Jews had enjoyed high prosperity;
but the kingdom was ruined, and all their strength was decayed, and, in short,
their name was almost extinguished, when they were led into captivity. He
therefore promises that the Church shall be purified from her filthiness, and
that she who is now solitary shall regain that condition which she formerly
held. And this is included in the word <i>Again, </i>that they may not doubt
that it is in the power of God to restore what he formerly gave, though it was
withdrawn for a time.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
children of thy bereavement.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F853</font></sup><font face="Palatino">By
"the children of bereavement" some suppose that orphan children are meant; but I
cannot agree with this, for "bereavement" and "barrenness" refer rather to the
person of the Church, and accordingly it is for the sake of amplification that
he describes them to be those who, contrary to expectation, had been given to
her who was bereaved and
barren.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Make room for me;
</i></font><font face="Palatino">that is, "withdraw for my benefit." Not that it
is proper for the godly to shut out their brethren or drive them from their
place; but the Prophet has borrowed from familiar language a mode of expression
fitted to declare that no inconvenience shall hinder many from desiring to be
admitted and to have room made for them. Now, this happened, when the Lord
collected innumerable persons out of the whole world; for suddenly, and contrary
to the expectation of men, the Church, which had formerly been empty, was
filled; its boundaries were enlarged and extended far and
wide.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>And thou shalt say in thy heart. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By
these words he declares that the restoration of the Church, of which he now
speaks, will be wonderful; and therefore he represents her as wondering and
amazed on account of having been restored in a strange and unexpected manner.
And truly a description of this sort is not superfluous; for, as a new offspring
grows up among men every day, by which the human race is propagated, so the
children of God and of the Church are born, who,
"not</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">from flesh and blood,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
1:13,) but by the secret power of God, are formed again to be new creatures. By
nature we have no share in the kingdom of God; 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F854</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and therefore, if any man contemplate this new and uncommon work, and in what
manner the Church is increased and maintained, he will be constrained to
wonder.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who hath begotten me
these? </i></font><font face="Palatino">He shews that this astonishment will not
be pretended, like expressions of this kind which frequently proceed from
flatterers, but that it will come from "the heart;" for there will be good
ground for wondering, that the Lord has preserved the Church amidst so great
dangers, and has multiplied it by a new and unexpected offspring. Who would have
thought that, at the time when the Jews were held in the greatest contempt, and
were overwhelmed by every kind of reproaches and distresses, there would be any
of the Gentiles who of their own accord desired to be associated with them? It
was also in the highest degree improbable that the dispositions of men should be
so suddenly changed as to adopt a religion which they had detested. Besides, the
partition-wall which had been erected between them hindered all foreigners and
uncircumcised persons from
entering.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I was bereaved
</i></font><font face="Palatino">(or
<i>barren)</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> and solitary.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">She now explains what was the chief ground of
that astonishment; namely, that formerly she brought forth no children, and was
altogether destitute. Doctrine, which is the seed of spiritual life, by which
the children of the Church are begotten,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600123&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 1:23,) had ceased; even the worship enjoined by the Law had been broken
off; and, in short, everything that usually contributes to upholding the order
of government had been taken away. Now, the Church is called <i>bereaved </i>or
<i>barren, </i>not because God hath forsaken her, but because his presence is
not always visible. We ourselves saw an image of that barrenness, when the Lord,
in order to punish the ingratitude of men, took away his doctrine, and allowed
them to wander in darkness. The Church might truly be said to be "bereaved" and
"barren," when none of her children were seen. Hence we ought to conclude how
foolish the Papists are, who wish that Christ would always govern his Church so
that it may never be "bereaved" or "barren;" seeing that the Lord, thougit he
does not forsake the Church, yet very frequently, on account of the ingratitude
of men, withdraws the tokens of his
presence.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who then hath
brought up those? </i></font><font face="Palatino">It is no easy matter for
those who are led into captivity, and who often change their place and
habitation, to "bring up" children; and when the law and the doctrine of piety
no longer resounded in the temple, spiritual nourishment had almost entirely
failed. But the Lord, who has no need of human aid, begets his children in an
extraordinary manner, and by the astonishing power of his Spirit, and "brings
them up" wherever he thinks proper; and in the fulfillment of this prediction,
the Lord supplied them with nurses contrary to the expectation of all, so that
it is not without reason that the Church wonders how they were reared. When we
read this prophecy we are reminded that we ought not to be distressed beyond
measure, if at any time we see the Church resemble a
"bereaved"</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">woman, and that we ought not to doubt that he
can suddenly, or in a moment, raise up and restore her, though we perceive no
means by which she can be restored.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Isaiah confirms what he had said a little
before, that the Lord would cause his Church, though for a very long time she
had been "barren"</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and "bereaved," to have an exceedingly numerous
offspring, and to be constrained to wonder at her own fruitfulness; and he does
so, in order to remove all doubt which might have found its way into their
hearts.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will lift up my hand
to the Gentiles.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">declares that he will give children to the
Church, not only from among the Jews, as formerly, but likewise from among "the
Gentiles."</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">And yet he indirectly asserts that this
generation shall be spiritual through the grace of adoption; for the metaphor of
a <i>banner </i>was intended to lead believers to expect a new kind of
generation, and different from that which is seen in the ordinary course of
nature. The Lord must therefore set up a sign, and display his secret power
through the Gospel, 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F855</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that, out of nations who differed so widely from each other both in customs and
in language, he might bring children to the Church, who should be united in the
same faith, as brethren meet in their mother's
bosom.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Those who think that, by the figurative
terms <i>Hand </i>and <i>Banner, </i>nothing more than the preaching of the
Gospel is meant, and who set aside the power of the Spirit, are mistaken; for
both ought to be united, and the efficacy of the Spirit ought not to be
separated from the preaching of the Gospel, as Paul clearly shews.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 3:6.) To this "hand"<i> </i>of God, therefore, to this "banner"<i>
</i>we must betake ourselves, when we see that the Church is oppressed by the
tyranny of wicked men. Though every effort be made to overthrow and destroy it,
the "hand"<i> </i>of God is higher, and in vain do men oppose him. He will at
length subdue and crush their obstinacy, that the Church may obtain some repose
in spite of all their exertions.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he
promises that the sons of the Church
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall be brought in her arms and
on her shoulders</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the language is
metaphorical, and means that God will find no difficulty, when he shall wish to
gather the Church out of her dispersion; for all the Gentiles will assist him.
Although this refers, in the first instance, to the Jews who had been banished
and scattered, yet it undoubtedly ought to be extended to all the elect of God,
who have become partakers of the same
grace.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And kings shall be thy
nursing fathers. </i></font><font face="Palatino">After having spoken of the
obedience of the Gentiles, he shews that this relates not to the common people
only, but to "kings"<i> </i>also. He compares "kings" to hired men who bring up
the children of others, and "queens" to "nurses," who give out their labor for
hire. Why so? Because "kings" and "queens" shall supply everything that is
necessary for nourishing the offspring of the Church. Having formerly driven out
Christ from their dominions, they shall henceforth acknowledge him to be the
supreme King: and shall render to him all honor, obedience, and worship. This
took place when the Lord revealed himself to the whole world by the Gospel; for
mighty kings and princes not only submitted to the yoke of Christ, but likewise
contributed their riches to raise up and maintain the Church of Christ, so as to
be her guardians and defenders.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence it ought
to be observed that something remarkable is here demanded from princes, besides
an ordinary profession of faith; for the Lord has bestowed on them authority and
power to defend the Church and to promote the glory of God. This is indeed the
duty of all; but kings, in proportion as their power is greater, ought to devote
themselves to it more earnestly, and to labor in it more diligently. And this is
the reason why David expressly addresses and exhorts them to "be wise, and serve
the Lord, and kiss his Son."<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;190210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
2:10-12.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">This shews how mad are the dreams of
those who assert that kings cannot be Christians without laying aside that
office; for those things were accomplished under Christ, when kings, who had
been converted to God by the preaching of the Gospel, obtained this highest
pinnacle of rank, which surpasses dominion and principality of every sort, to be
"nursing-fathers" and guardians of the Church. The Papists have no other idea of
kings being <i>"nursing-fathers" </i>of the Church than that they have left to
their priests and monks very large revenues, rich possessions and prebends, on
which they might fatten, like hogs in a sty. But that "nursing"<i> </i>aims at
an object quite different from filling up those insatiable gulls. Nothing is
said here about enriching the houses of those who, under false pretences,<i>
</i>hold themselves out to be ministers of the Church, (which was nothing else
than to corrupt the Church of God and to destroy it by deadly poison,) but about
removing superstitions and putting an end to all wicked idolatry, about
advancing the kingdom of Christ and maintaining purity of doctrine, about
purging scandals and cleansing from the filth that corrupts piety and impairs
the lustre of the Divine majesty.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Undoubtedly,
while kings bestow careful attention on these things, they at the same time
supply the pastors and ministers of the Word with all that is necessary for food
and maintenance, provide for the poor and guard the Church against the disgrace
of pauperism; erect schools, and appoint salaries for the teachers and board for
the students; build poor-houses and hospitals, and make every other arrangement
that belongs to the protection and defense of the Church. But those unnecessary
and extravagant expenses for Anniversaries and Masses, for golden vessels and
costly robes, which swell the pride and insolence of papists, serve only to
uphold pomp and ambition, and corrupt the pure and simple "nursing"<i> </i>of
the Church, and even choke and extinguish the seed of God, by which alone the
Church lives. When we see that matters are now very different, and that "kings"
are not the "nursing-fathers," but the executioners of the Church; when, in
consequence of taking away the doctrine of piety and banishing its true
ministers, idle bellies, insatiable whirlpools, and messengers of Satan, are
fattened, (for such are the persons to whom the princes cheerfully distribute
their wealth, that is, the moisture and blood which they have sucked out of the
people;) when even princes otherwise godly have less strength and firmness for
defending the Word and upholding the Church; let us acknowledge that this is the
reward due to our sins, and let us confess that we do not deserve to have good
"nursing-fathers." But yet,<i> </i>after this frightfully ruinous condition, we
ought to hope for a restoration of the Church, and such a conversion of kings
that they shall shew themselves to be "nursing-fathers" and protectors of
believers, and shall bravely defend the doctrine of the
Word.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And shall lick the dust
of thy feet. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This passage is also tortured by
the Papists in order to uphold the tyranny of their idol, as if kings and
princes had no other way of proving themselves to be sincere and lawful
worshippers of God than by adoring that masked prince of the Church instead of
God. Thus they consider the obedience of piety to consist in kissing the Pope's
feet with deep reverence. What they ought to think of such barbarous and
idolatrous worship, let them learn, first, from Peter, whose seat they boast of
occupying, who would not permit such honor to be rendered to him by the
centurion.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;441006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
10:6.) Let them, next, learn from Paul, who tore his garments, and rejected such
worship with the utmost abhorrence.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;441414&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
14:14.) What could be more absurd than to imagine that the Son of God appointed,
instead of a minister of the Gospel, an object of abhorrence, some king dazzling
in Persian luxury and splendor? But let us remember that the Church, so long as
she is a pilgrim in this world, is subjected to the cross, that she may be
humble and may be conformed to her Head; that if her foes make any cessation of
their hostility, still her highest ornament and lustre is modesty. Hence it
follows, that she has laid aside her own attire, when she is clothed with
irreligious pride.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet means
nothing else than the adoration by which princes bow down before God, and the
obedience which they render to his Word in the Church. What we have already said
must be carefully observed, that, when we speak of rendering honor to the
Church, she must never be separated from the Head; for this honor and worship
belongs to Christ, and, when it is bestowed on the Church, it still continues to
belong undivided to him alone. By the obedience of piety kings do not profess
submission, so as to bear the yoke of men, but to yield to the doctrine of
Christ. Whosoever therefore rejects the ministry of the Church, and refuses to
bear the yoke which God wishes to lay with his own hand on all his people, can
neither have any fellowship with Christ nor be a child of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For they shall not be
ashamed. </i></font><font face="Palatino">I consider
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>(asher) </i>to be a conjunction signifying <i>For; </i> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F856</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and the clause to which it belongs is closely connected with what goes
before, and has been improperly disjoined from it by some commentators. By this
argument he proves that it is highly proper for princes to submit cheerfully to
the government of God, and not hesitate to humble themselves before the Church;
because<i> </i>God will not suffer those who hope<i> </i>in him to "be ashamed."
As if he had said, "This is a pleasant and delightful
submission."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am Jehovah.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He connects his own truth with our salvation;
as if he had said, that he does not wish men to acknowledge him to be true or to
be God, unless he actually fulfill what he has promised. And hence we<i>
</i>obtain inestimable advantage; for, as it is impossible that God should not
continue to be the same, so the stability of our salvation, which the Prophet
infers from God's own stability, must remain
unshaken.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall the prey be taken from
the mighty? </i></font><font face="Palatino">Having solved, in the former verse,
an objection which might occur to the mind of believers, he now confirms that
solution still more; for it might have been thought incredible that the Jews
should be rescued out of the hands of so powerful an enemy, by whom they had
been taken in fair battle and reduced to slavery, He therefore adds this
question as uttered by the whole of the common people, among whom it probably
flew universally from mouth to mouth; and he immediately replies, as we shall
sec.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall the captivity of
the righteous </i></font><font face="Palatino">(or,<i> the righteous
captivity</i>)<i> be delivered? </i>And we ought, first, to observe this
metaphor, that the Church is called "the prey of the mighty" and "the captivity
of the righteous," that is, lawful captivity. He is said to be the
"righteous"<i> </i>possessor who is the lawful possessor; just as the prey, when
the war has been righteous, passes into the hands of a righteous possessor. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F857</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Such was the condition of the ancient people, after having been driven into
captivity; for, along with their native country, they had lost their liberty,
and were entirely in the power, and at the disposal, of the conqueror. And yet
we ought carefully to observe this metaphor, that the Church is oppressed by the
tyranny of princes, and exposed to the jaws of wolves, and nevertheless is
supposed to be their "just" prey. This is, indeed, shamefully wicked; but thus
were our fathers treated, and we are not more virtuous or more excellent than
our fathers.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The prey of the tyrant shall
be delivered. </i></font><font face="Palatino">However they may boast of having
a right to govern, and glory in an empty title, the Lord declares that they are
most wicked robbers, when he threatens that he will be an avenger and will
snatch their prey from them. God does not overtum just dominion; and hence it
follows that the dominion which they usurped over the people of God is mere
robbery and wicked tyranny. Neither their arms, nor their forces, nor their
warlike preparations, shall hinder the Lord from taking out of their hands an
unjust possession.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Nor does this promise relate
only to outward enemies and tyrants, but also to the tyranny of Satan, from
which we are rescued by the wonderful power of God. True indeed, he possesses
vast power, but God is far more powerful, takes away his arms and demolishes his
fortresses, that he may set us at liberty.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401229&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
12:29;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;421122&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
11:22.) If therefore we have had experience of the power of God in this respect,
so much the stronger reason have we for trusting that he will undoubtedly be our
deliverer, whenever our enemies shall lay us under their feet and oppress us
with cruel bondage.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
contend with him that contendeth with thee.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">When he threatens that He will "contend" on our
account, first, he reminds us to consider his power, that we may not regard the
matter by human reason or by the power of men. We ought not therefore to look at
what we can do or what resources we possess, but it is our duty to commit the
whole matter to the disposal of God alone, who is graciously pleased to protect
and defend us. Secondly, he affirms that he will be a powerful advocate, to
reply to the slanders of enemies. We said, a little before, that wicked men not
only are hurried along by violence and cruelty against the Church, but load her
with false and calumnious charges, as if they had a right to treat her with
cruelty; and therefore this consolation is highly necessary, that God will be
the defender of our innocence, to scatter by his defense all the idle pretences
which strengthen the audacity and fierceness of wicked men. Accordingly he again
repeats, &#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will save
thy children. </i></font><font face="Palatino">We derive great consolation from
knowing that we are united with him by so close a bond that he sets himself in
opposition to all who contend with us, "blesses those who bless us, and, on the
other hand, curses those who curse
us,"</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and, in short, declares that he is the enemy of
our enemies.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
12:3.) Hence also it ought to be observed, that, when we are restored to liberty
and life, when we are not oppressed by enemies, and, in short, when we are
saved, it is not a work of man; that no one may ascribe to his own industry what
God commands us to expect as an extraordinary blessing from himself
alone.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>And I will feed thy oppressors with their own flesh.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">First, he declares what is the nature of that
end which awaits the enemies of the Church, and threatens that they shall not
only be inflamed with mutual hatred, but shall likewise slay each other by
mutual slaughter. And indeed it is God who drives them headlong, and rouses them
to rage, so that they tum against themselves that strength which they formerly
exerted against the Church, fight with each other, as the Midianites did, and
bring destruction on themselves.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;070722&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Judges
7:22.) The meaning amounts to this, that there will be no need of outward aid or
of any preparations, when God shall determine to overtum and destroy the
reprobate; because, having been struck by him with giddiness, they shall wear
themselves out in mutual conflict by the insatiable rage with which they shall
attack each other.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And all
flesh shall know. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He repeats that statement
which we have formerly seen, namely, that he will be acknowledged by all to be
the God of Israel and the true and only God, when he shall have delivered his
people from destruction; for he intended it to be a demonstration of his
Divinity, that he openly manifested himself to be the Redeemer and Savior of his
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Mighty One of
Jacob. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Some read the word <i>Jacob </i>in the
vocative case: "O<i> </i>mighty Jacob;"<i> </i>but I read it in the genitive

One of Israel, that they may rely with their whole heart on his defense and
protection.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Where is that bill of
divorcement? </i></font><font face="Palatino">There are various interpretations
of this passage, but very few of the commentators have understood the Prophet's
meaning. In order to have a general understanding of it, we must observe that
union by which the Lord everywhere testifies that his people are bound to him;
that is, that he occupies the place of a husband, and that we occupy the place
of a wife. It is a spiritual marriage, which has been consecrated by his eternal
doctrine and sealed by the blood of Christ. In the same manner, therefore, as he
takes us under his protection as a early beloved wife, on condition that we
preserve our fidelity to him by chastity; so when we have been false to him, he
rejects us; and then he is said to issue a lawful divorce against us, as when a
husband banished from his house an adulterous
wife.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Thus, when the Jews were oppressed by
calamities so many and so great, that it was easy to conclude that God had
rejected and divorced them, the cause of the divorce came to be the subject of
inquiry. Now, as men are usually eloquent in apologizing for themselves, and
endeavor to throw back the blame on God, the Jews also complained at that time
about their condition, as if the Lord had done wrong in divorcing them; because
they were far from thinking that the promises had been made void, and the
covenant annulled, by their crimes. They even laid the blame on their ancestors,
as if they were punished for the sins of others. Hence those taunts and
complaints which Ezekiel relates.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Our fathers ate a sour
grape, and our teeth are set on edge."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;261802&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ezekiel
18:2.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Speeches of this kind being universally current among
them, the Lord demands that they shall produce the "bill of
divorcement,"</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">by means of which they may prove that they are
free from blame and have been rejected without
cause.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, a "bill of divorcement" was granted
to wives who were unjustly divorced; for by it the husband was constrained to
testify that his wife had lived chastely and honorably, so that it was evident
that there was no other ground for the divorce than that she did not please the
husband. Thus the woman was at liberty to go away, and the blame rested solely
on the husband, to whose sullenness and bad temper was ascribed the cause of the
divorce.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;052401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
24:1.) This law of divorcement, as Ezekiel shews,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401908&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
19:8,) was given by Moses on account of the hard-heartedness of that nation. By
a highly appropriate metaphor, therefore, the Lord shews that he is not the
author of the divorce, but that the people went away by their own fault, and
followed their lusts, so that they had utterly broken the bond of marriage. This
is the reason why he asks where is "that bill" of which they boasted; for there
is emphasis in the demonstrative pronoun,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hz</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>(zeh), that, </i>by which he intended to expose their idle excuses; as if he
had said, that they throw off the accusation, and lay blame on God, as if they
had been provided with a defense, whereas they had violated the bond of
marriage, and could produce nothing to make the divorce
lawful.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Or who is the creditor
to whom I sold you? </i></font><font face="Palatino">By another metaphor he
demonstrates the same thing. When a man was overwhelmed by debt, so that he
could not satisfy his creditors, he was compelled to give his children in
payment. The Lord therefore asks, "Has<i> </i>he been constrained to do this?
Has he sold them, or given them in payment to another creditor? Is he like
spendthrifts or bad managers, who allow themselves to be overwhelmed by
debt?"<i> </i>As if he had said, "You<i> </i>cannot bring this reproach against
me; and therefore it is evident that, on account of your transgressions, you
have been sold and reduced to
slavery."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lo, for your
iniquities ye have been sold. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Thus the Lord
defends his majesty from all slanders, and refutes them by this second clause,
in which he declares that it is by their own fault that the Jews have been
divorced and "sold."<i> </i>The same mode of expression is employed by Paul,
when he says that we are "sold<i> </i>under sin,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450714&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
7:14,) but in a different sense; in the same manner as the Hebrew writers are
wont to speak of abandoned men, whose wickedness is desperate. But here the
Prophet intended merely to charge the Jews with guilt, because, by their own
transgressions, they had brought upon themselves all the evils that they
endured.</font><br><font face="Palatino">If it be asked, "Did<i> </i>the Lord
divorce his heritage? Did he make void the covenant?" Certainly not; but the
Lord is said to "divorce,"<i> </i>as he is elsewhere said to profane, his
heritage,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;198939&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
89:39;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;262421&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
24:21,) because no other conclusion can be drawn from present appearances; for,
when he did not bestow upon them his wonted favor, it was a kind of divorce or
rejection. In a word, we ought to attend to these two contrasts, that the wife
is divorced, either by the husband's fault, or because she is unchaste and
adulterous; and likewise that children are sold, either for their father's
poverty or by their own fault. And thus the course of argument in this passage
will be
manifest.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Why did I come? </i></font><font face="Palatino">This might be a reason
assigned, that the people have not only brought upon themselves all immense mass
of evils by provoking God's anger, but have likewise, by their obstinacy, cut
off the hope of obtaining pardon and salvation. But I think that God proceeds
still further. After having explained that he had good reason for divorcing the
people, because they had of their own accord given themselves up to bondage,
when they might have been free, he adds that still it is not he who prevents
them from being immediately set at liberty. As he shewed, in the former verse,
that the whole blame rests with the Jews, so now he declares that it arises from
their own fault that they grow old and rot in their distresses; for the Lord was
ready to assist them, if they had not rejected his grace and kindness. In a
word, he shows that both the beginning and the progress of the evil arise from
the fault of the people, in order that he may free God from all blame, and may
shew that the Jews<i> </i>act wickedly in accusing him as the author of evil, or
in complaining that he will not assist
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">First, then, the Lord says that he "came;"
and why, but that he might stretch out his hand to the Jews? Whence it follows
that they are justly deprived; for they would not receive his grace. Now, the
Lord is said to "come," when he gives any token of his presence. He approaches
by the preaching of the Word, and he approaches also by various benefits which
he bestows on us, and by the tokens which he employs for manifesting his
fatherly kindness toward us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Was
there ever any people," as Moses says, "that<i> </i>saw so many signs, and heard
the voice of God speaking, like this people?"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050433&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
4:33.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Constant invitation having been of no
advantage to them, when he held out the hope of pardon and exhorted them to
repentance, it is with good reason that he speaks of it as a monstrous thing,
and asks why there was no man to meet him. They are therefore held to be
convicted of ingratitude, because, while they ought to have sought God, they did
not even choose to meet him when he came; for it is an instance of extreme
ingratitude to refuse to accept the grace of God which is freely
offered.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why did I call, and
no one answered? </i></font><font face="Palatino">In the word <i>call </i>there
is a repetition of the same statement in different words. When God "calls," we
ought to be ready and submissive; for this is the "answer" which, he complains,
was refused to him; that is, we ought to yield implicitly to his word. But this
expression applies strictly to the matter now in hand; because God, when he
offered a termination to their distresses, was obstinately despised, as if he
had spoken to the deaf and dumb. Hence he infers that on themselves lies the
blame of not having been sooner delivered; and he supports this by former
proofs, because he had formerly shewn to the fathers that he possessed abundance
of power to assist them. Again, that they may not cavil and excuse<i>
</i>themselves by saying that they had not obtained salvation, though they
heartily desired it, he maintains, on the other hand, that the cause of the
change ought to be sought somewhere else than in him, (for his power was not at
all diminished,) and therefore that he would not have delayed to stretch out his
hand to them in distress, if they had not wickedly refused his
aid.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By shortening hath my
hand been shortened? </i></font><font face="Palatino">By this interrogation he
expresses greater boldness, as if he were affirming what could not be called in
question; for who would venture to plead against God that his power was
diminished? He therefore relates how powerfully he rescued his people out of
Egypt, that they may not now imagine that he is less powerful, but may
acknowledge that their sins were the hinderance. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F858</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He says that by his reproof he "dried up the sea,"<i> </i>as if he had struck
terror by a threatening word; for by his authority, and at his command, the seas
were divided, so that a passage was opened up,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021421&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
14:21,) and Jordan was driven back.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;060316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joshua
3:16.) The consequence was, that "the<i> </i>fishes," being deprived of water,
died and
putrified.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>I clothe the heavens with blackness.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He mentions also that thick darkness which was
spread over all Egypt during the space of three days.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021022&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
10:22.) At that time the heaven was clothed as with a mouming dress; for, as
fine weather has a gladdening influence, so blackness and darkness produce
melancholy; and therefore he says, that the heavens were covered as with
sackcloth or with a mouming dress, as if they had been tokens and expressions of
mouming, 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F859</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
If any one prefer to view them as general statements, let him enjoy his opinion;
but I think it probable that he glances at the history of the deliverance from
Egypt, 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F860</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
front which it might easily be inferred that God, who had so miraculously
assisted the fathers, was prevented by their ingratitude from granting relief to
the miseries which now oppressed
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>The Lord Jehovah. </i></font><font face="Palatino">After having twice
convicted them of guilt, he adds a consolation in his usual manner; for when the
Lord covers us with shame, he intends immediately to free us from shame.
Although, therefore, he shewed that the people had been rejected for the best
possible reasons, and had perished by their own fault, because they proved
themselves to be even unworthy of deliverance, yet he promises assistance to
them. Again, because<i> </i>in a matter so difficult to be believed there needed
more than ordinary proof, he begins by saying that God has sent and instructed
him to execute his commands. This passage is commonly explained so as to relate
to Christ, as if it had not been applicable to the Prophet, because he
afterwards says, that he had been beaten with rods, which we nowhere read was
done to Isaiah. But there is no great force in this argument; for David
complains that his garments were divided,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;192218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
22:18,) which applies literally to Christ,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402735&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
27:35;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431924&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
19:24,) and yet it does not follow that this did not happen to David himself.
For my own part, I have no doubt, that Isaiah comes forward as one who
represents all the servants of God, not only those who were from the beginning,
but those who should come
afterwards.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hath given me the
tongue of the learned. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He says that the Lord
hath given him a "tongue," that the promises bywhieh he cheers the people may
have greater weight. Our faith wavers, if we suspect that a man speaks from
himself; and the condition of that people was so wretched that no human
arguments could induce them to entertain the hope of deliverance. It amounts to
this, that the message of approaching salvation is brought to them from heaven;
and if any person do not receive it, he must prove himself to be rebellious and
disobedient. Although these words are literally intended by the Prophet to
secure the belief of his statements, yet we may infer from them generally, that
no man is fit to teach who has not first been qualified by God. This reminds all
godly teachers to ask from the Spirit of God what otherwise they could not at
all possess. They must indeed study diligently, so as not to ascend the pulpit
till they have been fully prepared; but they must hold by this principle, that
all things necessary for discharging their office are gifts of the Holy Spirit.
And, indeed, if they were not organs of the Holy Spirit, it would be extreme
rashness to come forth publicly in the name of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That I may know a word in
season to the weary. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Some verb must be supplied
here, such as, "to<i> </i>administer" or "to utter." The word "know"<i>
</i>includes wisdom and skill, which a pastor ought to possess, that the word of
God may be faithfully and profitably administered by him; as if he had said that
he has been well instructed in the school of God, and thus knows well what is
suitable to those who are wretched and who groan under a burden. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F861</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The term "weary"<i> </i>is applied to those who are overwhelmed by many
afflictions; as we have formerly seen, "who<i> </i>giveth strength to the
weary."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234029&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
40:29.) Thus also Christ speaks, "Come to me, all ye that are weary and heavy
laden."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
11:28.) He therefore means that God has been his teacher and instructor, that he
may be able to soothe wretched men by appropriate consolation, that by means of
it their dejected hearts may be encouraged by feeling the mercy of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we infer that the most important duty
of the ministers of the word is, to comfort wretched men, who are oppressed by
afflictions, or who bend under their weight, and, in short, to point out what is
true rest and serenity of mind, as we have formerly seen.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233320&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
33:20.) We are likewise taught what each of us ought chiefly to seek in the
Scriptures, namely, that we may be fumished with doctrine appropriate and
suitable for relieving our distresses, He who, by seasonable consolation, in
afflictive or even desperate affairs, can cheer and support his heart, ought to
know that he has made good proficiency in the Gospel. I acknowledge that
doctrine has indeed various uses; for not only is it useful for comforting the
afflicted and feeble, but it likewise contains severe reproofs and threatenings
against the obstinate.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;550316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 3:16.) But Isaiah shews that the chief duty incumbent on him is, to
bring some consolation to the Jews who, in the present distress, are ready to
faint.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will waken in the
morning. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet here testifies that the
Lord is so careful about wretched<i> </i>and oppressed persons that he aids them
"in<i> </i>the morning," that is, seasonably. I do acknowledge that we are often
destitute of consolation; but, although God often permits us to languish, yet he
knows every<i> </i>moment that is suitable for seasonably meeting the
necessity<i> </i>by his aid. Besides, if his assistance be somewhat late, this
happens through our own fault; for not only by our indolence, but likewise by
rebellion, we withdraw ourselves from his grace. However that may be, he always
watches carefully and runs to give aid; and even when we fly and resist, he
calls us to him, that we may be refreshed by tasting his grace and
kindness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He twice repeats the phrase, "in the
morning," by which he expresses continuance<i> </i>and earnestness, that we may
not think that he is liable to sudden impulses like men, to cast off or quickly
forget those whom he has once undertaken to guard, whom he continues, on the
contrary, to make the objects of his grace till the end, and never leaves
destitute of consolation.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That
I may hear as the learned. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He means that his
ear has not only been pulled or twitched, as for sluggish and indolent persons,
but has been formed and trained. Yet by his example he shews that God
efficaciously teaches all whose ministry he intends to employ for the salvation
of his Church; for it would have been a small matter to be instructed after the
manner of men, if they had not within them the Spirit of God as their
instructor. This makes still more evident the truth of what we have formerly
said, that none are good teachers but those who have been good scholars. He
calls them "learned'and "well-instructed;" for they who do not deign to learn,
because they think that they are wise enough, are doubly fools; since they
alone, in the judgment of God, are reckoned to be "well-instructed" and
"learned," who permit themselves to be taught before discharging the office<i>
</i>of teachers, that they may have clear knowledge of those things which they
communicate to others, and may publicly bring forward nothing but what they can
testify to have proceeded from God; and, in a word, they alone are "learned," 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F862</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>who, by continually learning, do not refuse to make constant progress. Some
read the word in the accusative, meaning, "that I may hear as (hearing) the
learned;" but that is harsh and at variance with the true
meaning.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>The Lord Jehovah hath opened mine ear.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He again repeats what he had formerly said, and
here includes everything that belongs to the office of a teacher; for the
"opening of the ear" must be understood to refer not only to doctrine, but to
the whole calling; that is, when he takes one to be his servant, and intbrms of
his duty him whom he has determined to send, when he gives commands, and enjoins
him to execute<i> </i>what he commands. But the Lord "opens the ear,"<i> </i>not
only when he declares what is his will, but when he powerfully affects a man's
heart and moves him to render obedience, as it is said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Thou<i> </i>hast bored
mine ear."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;194006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm

6:45.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Such is also the import of the second clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I was not
rebellious</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the meaning of which may be
thus summed up: "He undertakes nothing at random, but, being fully convinced of
God's calling, he discharges the office of a teacher, though it is laborious and
difficult, because he is ready to
obey."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>I exposed my body to the smiters.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">With the reproaches, jeers, and insolence of
wicked men, he contrasts the unshaken courage which he possesses; as if he had
said that, "whatever resistancemay be attempted by the despisers of God, yet he
will baffle all their insults, so that he will never repent of the labors which
he has undertaken." Yet this passage plainly shows that the ministers of the
word cannot perform their office faithfully without being exposed to a contest
with the world, and even without being fiercely assailed on all sides; for as
soon as Isaiah says that he has obeyed the command of God, he likewise adds that
"He has exposed his body to the smiters."<i> </i>The faithful servants of God,
when they administer the doctrine of the word, cannot escape from this
condition, but must endure fights, reproaches, hatred, slanders, and various
attacks from adversaries, who loathe that liberty of advising and reproving
which it is necessary for them to use. Let them, therefore, arm themselves with
steadfastness and faith; for a dreadful battle is prepared for them. And not
only does he describe the persecutions of wicked men, but the reproach of the
world; because wicked men desire to be thought to have good cause for opposing
the ministers of the word and persecuting their doctrine, and wish that those
ministers should be regarded as criminals and malefactors, and held up to
universal hatred and abhorrence. For these reasons they lead them with various
slanders, and do not refrain from any kind of reproach, as we know well enough
by experience in the present day, when our adversaries call us heretics,
deceivers, seditious persons, and assail us with other slanders, which were also
directed against Christ and the Apostles.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402763&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew

from shame and spitting. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He not only says that
open and outward foes spat and inflicted blows on him, but glances at the
slanders which he is compelled to bear from foes who are within and belong to
the household; for out of the very bosom of the Church there always spring up
wicked men and despisers of God, who insolently attack the prophets. They who
wish to serve God must be prepared to endure all these things calmly, that they
may walk through evil report and through good report,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470608&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 6:8,) and may despise not only banishment, stripes, imprisonment,
and death, but likewise reproaches and disgrace, though they may sometimes
appear harder to endure than death itself. While this doctrine belongs to all
believers, it belongs especially to the teachers<i> </i>of the word, who ought
to go before others, and to be, as it were,
standard-bearers.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>For the Lord Jehovah will help me.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet declares whence comes so great
courage, which he and the other servants of God need to possess, in order to
withstand courageously the attacks of every one. It comes from God's assistance,
by relying on whom he declares that he is fortified against all the attacks of
the world. After having, with lofty fortitude, looked down contemptuously on all
that was opposed to him, he exhorts others also to maintain the same firmness,
and gives what may be called a picture of the condition of all the ministers of
the word; that, by tuming aside from the world, they may tum wholly to God and
have their eyes entirely fixed upon him. There never will be a contest so
arduous that they shall not gain the victory by trusting to such a
leader.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore I have set
my face as a flint. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By the metaphor of "a
flint" he shews that, whatever may happen, he will not be afraid; for terror or
alarm, like other passions, makes itself visible in the face. The countenance
itself speaks, and shews what are our feelings. The servants of God, being so
shamefully treated, must inevitably have sunk under such attacks, had they not
withstood them with a forehead of stone or of iron. In this sense of the term,
Jeremiah also is said to have been "set<i> </i>for a fortified city, an iron
pillar, and a brazen wall, against the kings of Judah, and the princes, and the
people,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240118&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
1:18; ) and to Ezekiel is said to have been given "a<i> </i>strong forehead, and
even one of adamant, and harder than that, that he might not be dismayed at the
obstinacy of the people."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;260309&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
3:9.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore I was not
ashamed. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The word "ashamed"<i> </i>is twice
used in this verse, but in different senses; for in the former clause it relates
to the feeling, and in the latter to the thing itself or the effect.
Accordingly, in the beginning of the verse, where he boasts that he is not
confounded with shame, because God is on his side, he means that it is not
enough that God is willing to help us, if we do not also feel it; for of what
advantage to us will the promises of God be, if we distrust him? Confidence,
therefore, is demanded, that we may be supported by it, and may assuredly know
that we enjoy God's favor.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
shall not be confounded. </i></font><font face="Palatino">In the conclusion of
the verse he boldly declares his conviction that the end will be prosperous.
Thus "to be confounded" means "to<i> </i>be disappointed;" for they who had
entertained a vain and deceitful hope are liable to be mocked. Here we see that
some special assistance is promised to godly teachers and ministers of the word;
so that the fiercer the attacks of Satan, and the stronger the hostility of the
world, so much the more does the Lord defend and guard them by extraordinary
protection. And hence we ought to conclude, that all those who, when they come
to the contest, tremble and lose courage, have never been duly qualified for
discharging their office; for he who knows not how to strive knows not how to
serve God and the Church, and is not fitted for administering the doctrine of
the
word.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>He is near that justifieth me. </i></font><font face="Palatino">We
ought always to keep in remembrance<i> </i>that the Prophet mentions nothing
that is peculiar to himself, but testifies what the Lord chooses to be, and will
always be, towards faithful ministers, that whosoever has this testimony, that
God has sent him, and knows that he discharges his office faithfully, may boldly
despise all adversaries, and may not be moved by their reproaches, for he is
"justified" by the Lord; and, in like manner, the Lord always is, and will be,
near to defend and maintain his truth. Besides, that any one may be able to make
this protestation, it is necessary that his conscience be pure; for, if any man
thrust himself rashly into the office, and have no testimony of his calling, or
bring forward his dreams publicly, in vain will he boast of this promise, which
belongs only to those who have been called by God, and who sincerely and
uprightly perform their duty. Now, although either hypocrites or despisers never
cease to annoy the servants of God, yet Isaiah advances to meet them, as if none
would venture to pick a quarrel or utter a slander; not that he can keep them in
check, 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F863</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but because they will gain nothing by all their attempts. He therefore declares,
that he looks down with utter contempt on the false accusations which the
enemies of sound doctrine pour out against its teachers. There is no crime with
which they do not upbraid them; but their efforts are fruitless; for the Judge,
by whom their integrity is maintained, is not far off. They may, therefore, as
Paul did, boldly appeal from the wicked and unjust judgments of men to "the day
of the Lord," by whom their innocence<i> </i>will be made manifest.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 4:4.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let us stand
together. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Godly teachers ought to have so great
confidence as not to hesitate to give a bold defiance to adversaries. Satan,
with his agents, does not always venture to attack openly, especially when he
fights by falsehoods, but by ambuscade, and by burrowing under ground, endeavors
to take them by surprise; but the servants of God are not afraid to "stand up"
openly, and enter into contest with the enemy, and contend by arguments,
provided that adversaries are willing to enter into the lists. So great is the
force of truth that it does not dread the light of day, as we say that Isaiah
here attacks boldly those whom he perceives to be plotting against him; and
therefore he repeats,
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let him draw near to
</i></font><font face="Palatino">me. Godly ministers ought to be ready to assign
a reason for their doctrine. But where is the man that is willing to hear them
patiently, and to consider what is the nature of that doctrine which they
publicly declare? True indeed, adversaries will approach, but it is to draw
their swords to slay them; to sharpen their tongues, that by every kind of
slander they may tear them in pieces. In short, their whole defense consists in
arms or deceitful stratagems; for they do not venture to contend by scriptural
arguments. Relying, therefore, on the justice of our cause, we may freely defy
them to the conflict. Though they condemn us without listening to our
vindication, and though they have many that support the sentence which they have
pronounced, we have no reason to be afraid; for God, whose cause we plead, is
our Judge, and will at length acquit
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>Who is he that condemmeth me? </i></font><font face="Palatino">Paul
appears to allude to this passage, in his Epistle to the Romans, when he says,
"It<i> </i>is God that justifieth; who shall condemn?"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450833&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:33, 34.) We may safely have recourse to the judgment-seat of God, when we are
well assured that we have obtained his righteousness by free grace through
Christ. But here Isaiah handles a different subject; for he does not speak of
the universal salvation of men, but of the ministry of the Word, which the Lord
will defend against the attacks of wicked men, and will not suffer his people to
be overwhelmed by their fraud or
violence.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lo, they shall all
wax old as a garment. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He now shews more clearly
that it is not in the shade or at case that he boasts of his courage, as if none
were giving him any disturbance; but he declares that, though he is assailed by
deadly foes, still he boldly maintains his position; because all who fight with
the Word of God shall fall and vanish away through their own frailty. In order
to place the matter before their own eyes, he employs a demonstrative particle,
<i>"Behold, </i>like garments shall they perish, being consumed by worms." The
Psalmist makes use of the same metaphor, when he compares the men of this world
to the children of God.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;194914&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
49:14, 15.) The former, though they make a show and shine like dazzling
garments, shall perish; but believers, who now are covered with filth, shall at
length obtain new brightness and shine brilliantly like the stars. Here he
speaks literally of fierce dogs that attack and bark at godly teachers. Though
such persons are held in high estimation by men, and possess very high authority
among them, yet their lustre shall perish and fade away, like that of garments
which are eaten by worms.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is among you that feareth
the Lord? </i></font><font face="Palatino">After having spoken of God's
invincible aid, by which all prophets are protected, he directs his discourse to
believers, that they may suffer themselves to be guided by the Word of God, and
may become obedient. Hence we may infer how far a holy boasting raised him above
his slanderers; for, in consequence of wicked men, through their vast numbers,
possessing at that time great influence among the Jews, there was a risk of
overwhelming the faith of the small minority. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F864</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
When he asks, "Where<i> </i>are they that fear God?" he points out that their
number is small. Yet he addresses them separately, that they may detach
themselves from the mixed crowd, and not take part in counsels which are wicked,
and which God has condemned. In like manner we have formerly met with these
words, "Say ye not, A confederacy."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230812&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
8:12.) Although therefore the enemies of God are so numerous as to constitute a
vast army, yet Isaiah does not hesitate to say that there are some left who
shall profit by his doctrine.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He speaks to those
who "fear<i> </i>God;"<i> </i>for, wherever there is no religion and no fear of
God, there can be also no entrance for doctrine. We see how audaciously doctrine
is rejected by those who, in other respects, wish to be reckoned acute and
sagacious; for, in consequence of being swelled with pride, they detest modesty
and humility, and are exceedingly stupid in this wisdom of God. It is not
without good reason, therefore, that he lays this foundation, namely, the fear
of God, that his Word<i> </i>may be attentively and diligently heard. Hence also
it is evident that true fear of God is nowhere to be found, unless where men
listen to his Word; for hypocrites do proudly and haughtily boast of piety and
the fear of God, but they manifest rebellious contempt, when they reject the
doctrine of the Gospel and all godly exhortations. The clear proof of such
persons is, that the mask which they desire to wear is torn
off.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let him hear the voice of
his servant. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He might have simply said, "the<i>
</i>voice of God," but he expressly says, "of<i> </i>his servant;" for God does
not wish to be heard but by the voice of his ministers, whom he employs to
instruct us. Isaiah speaks first of himself, and next of all others who have
been invested with the same office; and there is an implied contrast between
that "hearing"<i> </i>which he demands and that wicked eagerness to despise
doctrine in which irreligious men indulge, while they also, by their insolence,
encourage many idle and foolish persons to practice similar
contempt.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He who hath walked
in darkness. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Believers might have brought it as
an objection, that the fruit of their piety was not visible, but that they were
miserably afflicted, as if they had lived a life of abandoned wickedness; and
therefore the Prophet anticipates and sets aside this complaint, by affirming
that believers, though hitherto they have been harshly treated, yet do not in
vain obey God and his Word; for, if they "have walked in darkness," they shall
at length enjoy the light of the Lord. By "darkness" the Prophet here means not
the ignorance or blindness of the human understanding, but the afflictions by
which the children of God are almost always overwhelmed. And this is the
consolation which he formerly mentioned, when he declared that "the tongue of
the learned had been given to him, that he might speak a word to one who was
faint." (Ver. 4.) Thus he promises that they who have hitherto been discouraged
and almost overwhelmed by so many distresses shall receive
consolation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lo, all of you kindle a fire.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He upbraids the Jews with choosing to kindle
for themselves their own light, instead of drawing near to the light of God.
This passage has been badly expounded; and if we wish to understand its true
meaning, we must attend to the contrast between the light of God and the light
of men; that is, between the consolation which is brought to us by the Word of
God and the empty words of comfort uttered by men, when by idle and useless
things they attempt and toil to alleviate their distresses. Having formerly
spoken of "light" and "darkness," and having promised light to believers, who
hear the voice of the Lord, he shews that the Jews had rejected this light, in
order to kindle another light for themselves, and threatens that ultimately they
shall be consumed by this light, as by a conflagration. Thus Christ upbraids the
Jews with "rejoicing<i> </i>in John's light,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430535&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
5:35,) because they made a wrong use of his official character, in order to
obscure or rather to extinguish the glory of Christ. To bring forward John's
official character, in order to cover with darkness the glory of Christ, was
nothing else than to extinguish the light of God shining in a mortal man, in
order to kindle another light for themselves, not that it might guide them by
pointing out the road, but that, by foolishly rejoicing in it, they might be
driven about in every direction.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he says
that they are </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>surrounded by
sparks</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he glances at their various
thoughts, by which they were agitated and carried about in uncertainty sometimes
in one direction and sometimes in another; and in this way he mocks at their
folly, because they willingly and eagerly ran wheresoever their foolish
pleasures drew them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Walk in
the light of your fire. </i></font><font face="Palatino">As if he had said,
"You<i> </i>shall know by experience how useless and transitory is your light,
when your unwarranted hopes shall have deceived you." The ironical permission
denotes disappointment. Others explain it, that wicked men kindle against
themselves the fire of God's wrath; but the Prophet looked higher, and that
sentiment appears not to agree with this
passage.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From my hand.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Because wicked men, being intoxicated by false
confidence, think that they are placed beyond the reach of all danger, and,
viewing the future with reckless disregard, trust to "their own light," that is,
to the means of defense with which they imagine themselves to be very abundantly
provided; the Lord declares, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall lie down in
sorrow,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and that this shall proceed
"from<i> </i>his hand;" and, in a word, that men who have forsaken the light of
the Word, and who seek consolation from some other quarter, shall miserably
perish.</font><br></div>

because they are few in number; for they had been cut down and diminished to
such a degree that they appeared to be on the eve of being reduced to nothing,
while there was little or no hope of any to succeed them. He therefore reminds
them of their origin, that they may know that, though they are a small remnant,
God can increase and multiply them; and he bids them contemplate their father
Abraham, who, though he was a single individual, grew to a vast number, and
received from God a numerous posterity. Hence they might infer that God, who, in
so short a period, had multiplied their fathers, would in future multiply them
also; because his power has not been diminished, and his will has not been
changed.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Look to the rock of

that he is called a "Rock,"<i> </i>because he was worn out by age, and that
Sarah is called a <i>Pit, </i>because she was barren. But both, in my opinion,
are in the wrong; for it is a simple metaphor, taken from quarries, and declares
that they have descended from Abraham and Sarah, as stones are cut out of a
"rock" and a "pit."<i> </i>Amidst the ruin of the nation it was highly necessary
that the godly should be supported by this doctrine and admonition. God had
promised that the seed of Abraham should be "as the stars of heaven,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011505&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
15:5,) and as "the<i> </i>sand of the sea."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
22:17.) This promise had apparently failed amidst that desolation in which they
who were left hardly differed at all from a few clusters when the vintage was
ended.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But since they had already known by
experience how powerful was the strength of God to create a vast people out of
nothing, the Prophet bids them cherish favorable hopes, that they may not be
ungrateful to God; and he addresses his discourse directly to believers, to whom
this was a sore temptation. He does not speak to all, but to those only who
could rely on the promise, that is, to those whom he calls "followers of
righteousness;" for the country abounded with unbelievers and hypocrites, who
had formerly revolted from the practice of piety; and so much the more laudable
was the steadfastness of those who did not cease to follow what was right.
Wherever "righteousness" is practiced, there God is listened to; and wherever
unbelief reigns, reliance cannot be placed on any promise.

Although therefore they boasted that they were the children of Abraham, yet all
were not capable of receiving this
doctrine.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye that seek
Jehovah. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He explains the method of "following
righteousness" to consist in "seeking the Lord;" for they who make an outward
shew of "righteousness," and do not aim at this end, must have wandered during
their whole life. These two things, therefore, must be joined together; namely,
the practice of righteousness and seeking
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>For I called him alone. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This
application plainly shews what was the design of this exhortation of the
Prophet. It was to encourage the hearts of believers to cherish the hope of a
better condition. He says<i> </i>that he "called him <i>one </i>or <i>alone,"
</i>not only because he had none along with him, when he was called out of his
country, but because the Lord suffered him to dwell in the land of Canaan
without children up to a worn out old age, so that he had no hope of having
children, especially because Sarah
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
16:2) also was barren; and when at length, as a solace for their childless
condition, one son was given to them, not long afterwards he appeared to be led
forth to slaughter. Yet the Lord increased and enriched him with a great number
of children.</font><br><font face="Palatino">How needful this consolation was to
the Jews has been remarked by me a little before, and may be easily learned from
their condition, which history plainly declares to have been wretched and
unhappy. To us also, in the present day, amidst this distracted condition of the
Church, it is highly necessary, that we may not be discouraged because our
number is small, and that we may hope that God will increase his Church by
unexpected methods. We behold a very clear and striking testimony of this in the
blessing by which the Lord increased, even to extreme old age, the posterity of
Abraham, who was childless and solitary. That promise relates not to the Jews
only, but to other nations; and on this account also he</font><br></div>

suddenly produced from one man so numerous an offspring, so he will also people
his Church by wonderful and unknown methods, and not once only, but whenever she
shall be thought to be childless and solitary. In like manner, Paul, after
having spoken of the faith of Abraham and praised his excellence, applies that
doctrine to each<i> </i>of us,
that</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"he believed in hope against
hope, and that his mind was not driven hither and thither, but that he was fully
persuaded that what God had promised he was able also to perform, though it

"The<i> </i>Lord will comfort his Church, not only when she shall be in a
flourishing condition, but likewise when she shall be desolate and reduced to
solitude; <i>" </i>for she must have been laid desolate, and her frightful ruins
must have brought her to the verge of destruction, before she felt the aid which
is here described.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And will
make her desert like a place of delights.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>The Prophet here alludes to a passage in the writings of Moses, in which he
relates that man was at first placed in "the<i> </i>garden of Eden,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010215&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
2:15,) that is, in "a<i> </i>place of delights," from which he was driven out by
his own fault.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010324&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
3:24.) Now we, who have been deprived of that blessing which he bestowed on our
first parent, are exiles throughout the whole world, and are deprived of that
paradise. Accordingly, whenever great calamities happen, and the order of events
is overturned, and everything is thrown into wretched desolation and ruin, let
us know that we are punished for our unbelief and for our heinous sins; and let
us remember that sentence which was pronounced on our first parent, or rather on
all mankind; and that in every part of life, but especially when we see the
condition of the Church ruined and overturned. The earth, which otherwise would
abound in blessings of every kind, has been reduced to solitude through our
fault; and the Church, which would flourish everywhere, has been ruined and laid
desolate.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Joy and gladness.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He means that the change shall be so great that
the Church will no longer groan or complain; for, so long as the Church was
oppressed by a harsh captivity, nothing could be heard in her but mouming and
lamentation. Now restored, she shall rejoice and render thanksgiving to God.
Thus we are also exhorted to gratitude, that we may burst out into praise and
thanksgiving to God, when we have had experience of his
goodness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>Attend to me, my people. </i></font><font face="Palatino">There are
good reasons why the Lord so frequently demands that he shall be heard. We know
by experience how slow we are to hear him, especially in adversity; and even
when we would have great need of consolation, we reject it by our impatience,
and faint. Each of us, therefore, the sorer are the afflictions which press upon
him, ought to endeavor more earnestly to enlarge his heart, and in this way to
arouse himself, and to shake off his slothfulness, that he may receive
consolation. What is here demanded is <i>attention, </i>to<i> </i>sustain our
hearts by patience, till the season of grace be fully
come.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the law shall go
forth from me. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The meaning is, that the Lord
will again reign, and will arouse his Church to call on his name. Though the
word <i>Law </i>is equivalent to the edict which God shall order to be
proclaimed, when he shall be pleased to gather his Church, yet at the same time
he describes his manner of reigning; namely, by his "Law"<i> </i>and byhis
doctrine. Hence we see that wherever doctrine is rejected, God's government is
not found, that is, is not recognised by men. By<i> judgment </i>he means the
order and administration of government, by which he shall restore his
kingdom.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For a light of the
peoples, </i></font><font face="Palatino">He says that this will be "for a light
of the peoples," because, when God begins to reign, miserable men

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[ygra</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>(argiang) </i>is variously expounded by commentators, because
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[gr</font><font face="Palatino">
(ragang) has various significations. Sometimes it signifies to "cut" and "open,"
and sometimes "to<i> </i>be at rest." Some therefore explain it, "I<i> </i>will
cause to rest," that is, "I<i> </i>will establish;" and that meaning is not
inappropriate. Most of the Jewish writers explain it differently, but I shall
not relate their crooked and harsh interpretations. I rather approve of this
translation, "I will manifest judgment," or, "I will cause judgment to break
forth," or, which means the same thing, "I will reveal;" because I think that it
agrees better with the former clause. Repetitions, we know, are very customary
among the Hebrew writers. Although, therefore, he employs different words, still
the meaning is the same. Having formerly said that "the<i> </i>law shall go
forth from him," he now says that "he<i> </i>will reveal
judgment."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>My righteousness is near. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He
confirms the former doctrine. The
"righteousness"</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of the Lord has relation to men, who know by
experience that he is "righteous." While the people were oppressed by cruel
bondage, they knew, indeed, that they were justly punished for their sins; but
they might wonder that they were so much forsaken, because the worship of God
ceased, and his name was blasphemed by wicked men, who pursued their wicked
career without punishment. In order, therefore, to bring them some consolation,
he promises that God will speedily assist them, so that all shall acknowledge
that he is faithful and just. By the word "righteous" the Prophet does not mean
that he renders to every one a "righteous" reward, but that he yields the best
protection, and dispenses the largest kindness to his people, that he faithfully
performs his promises to all believers, when he delivers them and does not
suffer them to be finally overwhelmed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This
appears more clearly from the following clause, in which, for the purpose of
explanation, he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My
salvation hath gone forth; for</i></font><font face="Palatino"> the
"righteousness" of God shone brightly in the deliverance of the people. Now, the
captivity in which the Jews were held in Babylon was a kind of death, in
consequence of which that deliverance is here called
"Salvation."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My arms shall
judge the peoples. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By "arms"<i> </i>he means
the wide exercise of his power. That figure of speech which describes God under
forms of expression drawn from the human frame occurs frequently in Scripture.
Because God's government appeared to be confined within narrow limits, or rather
was not at all visible, on this account he mentions <i>arms, </i>by which he
means that he will spread his kingdom far and
wide.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>Lift up your eyes toward heaven.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">When we see so great changes in the world, we
are apt to think that the Church comes within the influence of the sanhe violent
motion; and therefore we need to have our minds elevated above the ordinary
course of nature; otherwise, the salvation of the Church will appear to hang on
a thread, and to be carried hither and thither by the billows and tempests. Yet,
we may see both in heaven and in earth how wisely God regulates all things, with
what fatherly kindness he upholds and defends his workmanship and the frame of
the world, and with what equity he provides for all his creatures. But in a
remarkable manner he deigns to watch over his Church, as he has separated her
from the ordinary rank.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
look upon the earth beneath. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Both of the views
now stated are here embraced by the Prophet; for he bids believers turn their
eyes upwards and downwards, so as to perceive both in heaven and in earth the
wonderful providence of God, by which he so beautifully preserves the order and
harmony which he at first established. But he adds that, though heaven and earth
hasten to decay, it is impossible that the Church shall fail, the stability of
which is founded on God; as if he had said, "A thousand times rather shall
leaven mingle with the earth than the promise on which your salvation rests
shall fail of its
accomplishment."-</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My salvation
shall endure for ever. </i></font><font face="Palatino">First of all, he
mentions "salvation," and next he speaks of "righteousness," on which it rests
as on a solid foundation. Whenever,<i> </i>therefore, dangers shall press upon
us on every hand, let us learn to betake ourselves to this place of refuge. And
with this sentiment agree the words of the Psalmist,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The heavens shall wax
old and vanish away; but thou, Lord, art always the same, and thy years are not
changed."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A226&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
102:26, 27)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Both passages remind us that the grace of God, which
he displays in the preservation of his Church, surpasses all his other works.
Everything that is contained in heaven and earth is frail and fading; but God's
salvation, by which he guards the Church, is eternal, and therefore cannot be
liable to these
dangers.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>Hearken to me. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Because wicked men,
when they enjoy prosperity, laugh at our faith, and ridicule our distresses and
afflictions, on this account the Prophet exhorts believers to patience, that
they may not dread their reproaches or be dismayed by their slanders. The reason
assigned is, that their prosperity shall not be of long duration. Whatever may
be their insolent boasting, they are already pronounced (verse 8) to be the food
of <i>moths </i>and <i>worms; </i>while God holds in his hand the salvation of
believers, from which they appear to be thrown to the greatest possible
distance. Here we ought again to observe the repetition of the word <i>Hearken.
</i>This is now the third time that the Lord demands a "hearing;"<i>
</i>because, when we tremble with anxiety on account of our distresses, it is
with the greatest difficulty that we rely on his promises, and therefore we need
to be often roused and stimulated, till we have conquered every
difficulty.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye that know
righteousness, </i></font><font face="Palatino">Here he does not address
unbelievers, but those who "know<i> </i>righteousness;"<i> </i>because, though
they do not intentionally reject the word of God, yet they often shut the door
against his "righteousness,"<i> </i>so that it does not reach them, when, under
the influence of adversity, they shut their ears and almost despair. In order
therefore that they may receive the promises, and that they may admit
consolation, the Prophet stirs up and arouses
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A people in whose heart
is my law. </i></font><font face="Palatino">We must attend to the train of
thought. First, he describes what kind of people the Lord wishes to have,
namely, "those who know righteousness;"<i> </i>and next he explains what is the
nature of this knowledge, that is, when the people have "the law" fixed and
deeply rooted in their hearts. Without the word of the Lord there call be no
"righteousness." No laws of men, however well framed, will lead us to true
righteousness, of which they may indeed give us a feeble idea, but which they
never can justly describe. At the same time, he shews in what manner we ought to
make progress in the law of the Lord; namely, by embracing it with the heart;
for the seat of the law is not in the brain, but in the heart, that, being
imbued with heavenly doctrine, we may be altogether
renewed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>But my righteousness shall continually endure.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Because the believing servants of God must
endure many reproaches and slanders from the enemies of the word, the Prophet
exhorts and encourages them to bear it courageously. It frequently happens that
we are more deeply moved by the contumely and insults of men than by fire and
sword; but we ought to reckon it praise and glory to be the object of their
contempt and abhorrence. True valor springs from this consideration, that,
although the world reject us as "filth and offscourings,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460413&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 4:13,) God holds us in estimation; because we maintain the same
cause with himself. Let us with Moses, therefore, "prefer the reproach of Christ
to the treasures of the Egyptians."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581126&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:26.) Let us rejoice with the Apostles, who</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"departed<i> </i>from the

the name of Jesus."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;440541&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Acts
5:41.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And my salvation for ever and ever.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Because the death of wicked men would yield to
us small consolation, if we were not saved, he shews what will be our condition,
namely, that we shall never be left destitute of "God's<i> </i>righteousness and
salvation." But the comparison may appear to be inappropriate, when he contrasts
the destruction of the wicked with his righteousness. Far more clearly and
suitably it might have been thus expressed: "though the reprobate indulge in
mirth, yet they shall speedily perish; but believers, though they appear to be
dead, shall live." Again, because he makes no mention of us, and commends only
the eternity of God's righteousness, it may be objected, that to us who are
almost overwhelmed this is of no avail. But by these words the Prophet instructs
us, that in our afflictions we ought to seek consolation from the thought, that
our health and salvation are, as it were, shut up in God; for, so long as men
trust or rely on themselves, they cannot cherish any good hope that does not
speedily decay; and therefore we ought to turn our hearts to God, whose
"mercy<i> </i>endureth from everlasting to everlasting on them that fear him,"
as David says, "and<i> </i>his righteousness to children's children."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A317&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
103:17.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Because salvation is founded on the
goodness of God, Isaiah reminds us of it, that men may be reduced to nothing,
and that confidence may be placed in God alone. The meaning may be thus summed
up, "<i>Salvation </i>is in God, that by it he may preserve, not himself, but
us; <i>righteousness </i>is in God, that he may display it for our defense and
preservation." Accordingly, from the eternity of God's "salvation and
righteousness" we ought to infer that the servants of God cannot possibly
perish; which agrees with the passage quoted a little before from
David,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Thou art the same, and thy
years shall not fail. The children of thy servants shall dwell, and their
posterity shall be established for ever."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A227&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
102:27, 28.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Thus we see how he applies this
eternity to the children of God, who do not subsist in themselves, but in God,
and have the foundation of their salvation in
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>Awake, awake. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet
instructs us, that, when God cheers us by his promises, we ought also to pray
earnestly that he would perform what he has promised. He does not comfort us in
order to render us slothful, but that we may be inflamed with a stronger desire
to pray, and may continually exercise our faith. The Prophet speaks according to
our feelings; for we think that God is asleep, so long as he does not come to
the relief of our wants; and the Lord indulges us so far as to permit us to
speak and pray according to the feeling of our weakness. Believers therefore
entreat the Lord to "awake,"<i> </i>not that they imagine him to be idle or
asleep in heaven; 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F868</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but, on the contrary, they confess their own sluggishness and ignorance, in not
being able to form any conception of God, so long as they are not awaro of
receiving his assistance. But yet, though the flesh imagine that he is asleep,
or that he disregards our calamities, faith rises higher and lays hold on his
eternal power.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Put on
strength, O arm of Jehovah. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He is said to
"awake" and "put<i> </i>on strength," when he exhibits testimonies of his power,
because otherwise we think that he is idle or asleep. Meanwhile, the Prophet, by
addressing the arm of God which was concealed, holds it out to the view of
believers as actually present, that they may be convinced that there is no other
reason why they are so bitterly and painfully afflicted by their enemies than
because God has withdrawn his aid. The cause of the delay has been already
shewn, that they had estranged themselves from
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In ancient days.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">By the term "ancient<i> </i>days" he shews that
we ought to bear in remembrance all that the Lord did long ago for the salvation
of his people. Though he appears to pause and to take no more care about us,
still he is the same God who formerly governed his Church; and therefore he can
never forsake or abandon those whom he takes under his
protection.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In ages long ago
past. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This repetition tells us still more
clearly, that we ought to consider not only those things which have happened
lately, but those which happened long ago; for we ought to stretch our minds
even to the most remote ages, that they may rise above temptations, which
otherwise might easily overwhelm
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Art thou not it that

</i>The numerous testimonies of grace which God had displayed in various ages
are here collected by the Prophet, so that, if a few are not enough, the vast
number of them may altogether confirm the faith of the Church. But, since it
would be too tedious to draw up an entire catalogue, he brings forward that
singular and most remarkable of all such events, namely, that the people were
once delivered from Egypt in a miraculous manner, for I have no doubt that by
<i>Rahab </i> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F870</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>

<div><font face="Palatino">It is sufficiently evident, and is universally
admitted, that the Prophet here calls to remembrance<i> </i>the miraculous
deliverance of the people from Egypt. "If<i> </i>at that time the pride of Egypt
was tamed and subdued, if the dragon was put to flight, why should we not hope
for the same thing?"</font><br><font face="Palatino">By putting the question, if
it be the same arm, he argues from the nature of God; for this could not be
affirmed respecting the "arm" of man, whose strength, though it be great, is
diminished and fails through time? Milo, who had been very strong, when he
became old and looked at his arms, groaned because the strength which he
possessed at an earlier period had now left him. But it is not so with God,
whose strength no lapse of time can diminish. These words ought to be read
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejmfatikw~v</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>emphatically, "Art thou not it? " For he shews that the Lord is the same as
he formerly was, because he remains
unchangeable.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which dried up the sea.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Though Isaiah does not relate all the miracles
which God performed when he brought out his people from the bondage of Egypt,
yet he intended to include in a few words all that are related by Moses, that
the Jews, having been briefly addressed, might consider the various ways in
which the Lord had demonstrated his power. The drying up of the Red Sea is
mentioned, not only on account of the extraordinary excellence of the miracle,
but because the numerous miracles which preceeded<i> </i>it were directed to
this end, that the people, rescued from unjust violence and tyranny, might pass
into the promised land. Accordingly, the Prophet expressly mentions that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a way was opened up for the
redeemed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>From this example we ought to
consider what God will be to us, so as to draw this conclusion, that in future
God will always be like himself, as is evident from the
context.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>.
</i></b><i>Therefore the redeemed by Jehovah shall return.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He<i> </i>now describes more plainly what he
had briefly remarked; for, after having related the magnificent works of God, by
which he formerly displayed his power in Egypt, in order to deliver his people,
he concludes that neither the sea, nor the lofty rocks, nor the whirlpools, nor
even hell itself, can prevent him from leading forth his people out of Babylon.
And in order to confirm it more fully, and to apply that example, he calls them
"redeemed,"<i> </i>that they may know that, when God calls himself the deliverer
of his people, this belongs to them, and that they may not doubt that, in
delivering them, he will produce<i> </i>such an example as had been already
exhibited; for the reason is the
same.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall come to Zion.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Namely, to that place where he wished that men
should call on his name, that the temple may be rebuilt and the pure worship of
God restored; for, since the Jews, during the Babylonish captivity, ought to
expect the same aid as had been obtained by their fathers, because God was in
like manner the Redeemer of the children also, they were superior to the fathers
in one respect, that God had at that time chosen Mount Zion, in which he had
promised that his rest would be eternal.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

The meaning is, that there will be a great and unexpected change, so that they
shall have very abundant ground of joy and thanksgiving. When he says that
<i>joy shall be on their head, </i>he alludes to the chaplets of flowers with
which they were wont to adorn themselves at banquets. He adds that "they shall
obtain joy," which denotes that their enjoyment shall be solid and lasting.
Lastly, for the purpose of amplification, he adds that all sorrow shall be
banished, that they may not dread what frequently happens, that <i>joy, </i>by a
sudden change, shall give place to mourning.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;201413&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
14:13.) Yet the Prophet instructs them, though they groan and are sorrowful, to
wait patiently for that issue which he
promises.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>I, I am. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Here the Lord not only
promises grace and salvation to the Jews, but remonstrates with them for
refusing to believe him, and for valuing his power less than they ought. It is
exceedingly base to tremble at the threatenings of men to such a degree as to
care nothing about God's assistance; for he displays his power for this purpose,
that he may at least fortify; us against every attack. Accordingly, by an
excessive fear of men we betray contempt of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence it is evident how sinful it is to be
agitated by the terrors of men, when God calls us to repose. And indeed it is
amazing ingratitude in men, who, when they hear that God is on their side,
derive no hope from his magnificent promises, so as to venture boldly to
exclaim, "If<i> </i>God be for us, who can be against us?"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450831&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:31.) The consequence is, that when dangers arise, they are terrified and
confounded, and attribute far more to the power of mortal man in attacking than
to the power of God in defending. Justly, therefore, does he upbraid the Jews
with not fortifying themselves by these promises, and with not rendering
themselves invincible against every danger; for God is treated with the highest
dishonor when we doubt his truth, that is, when we are so completely overcome by
human terrors that we cannot rest on his
promises.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The repetition, <i>I, I, </i>is highly
emphatic. He who promises consolation is the God of truth, against whom neither
the strength nor the contrivances of men will be of any avail. When thou
distrustest him, it follows that thou dost not consider who he
is.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That thou shoudest be
afraid of a man. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He describes how frail,
fading, transitory: and unsubstantial is the condition of men, in order to
exhibit more fully their criminal stupidity in preferring a shadow and smoke to
God. He shews that men, so long as they are mindful of God, cannot be struck
down by fear. Consequently, when we are stunned by dangers that assail us, it
follows that we have forgotten God; and therefore he adds,
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And hast forgotten Jehovah
thy Maker. </i></font><font face="Palatino">It is not enough to imagine that
there is some God, but we ought to acknowledge and embrace him as ours. When he
calls him "Maker,"<i> </i>this must not be understood to refer to universal
creation, but to spiritual regeneration, as we have already explained under
other passages. In this sense Paul calls us
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">to&lt;

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:10,) because he hath created us to every good work. Thus, if we remember our
creation and adoption, these beginnings may encourage us to hope for continued
progress, that we may not be ungrateful to God, when he has proved his veracity
by undoubted experience.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who
hath stretched out the heavens and founded the earth.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">To the special kindness which God had exercised
towards his people he likewise adds his boundless power which he contrasts with
the weakness of men, whom he formerly compared to withered grass.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234007&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
40:7.) He demonstrates that power by his works, so that they who do not perceive
it must be exceedingly stupid; for we cannot tum our eyes in any direction
without perceiving very abundant testimonies of divine goodness and power,
which, however, are briefly described by a figure of speech in which a part is
taken for the whole, when he says that it is "He who stretched out the heavens
and founded the earth." It is therefore the greatest folly and indolence to
forget him, for so numerous are the signs and testimonies which recall him to
the remembrance of men.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
hast dreaded continually. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He follows out the
same comparison. "What</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">are men," says he, "that thou shouldst dread
them, if thou compare them to God, who promises thee his assistance?" Assuredly,
God is grievously blasphemed, if we refuse to believe that he is more powerful
to preserve than enemies are to destroy us; and therefore the Lord bids us
consider who and what he is, how vast and extensive is his power, that we may
not dread the fury of a mortal man, who vanishes like a whirlwind or like
smoke.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>

<i>(tzoeh) </i> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F872</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F873</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But it is more customary to interpret it as meaning one who is imprisoned and
oppressed, or an exile who wanders about without any settled abode. Now, the
Jews were not only exiles but captives, so that they were not at liberty to
return to their native land; and therefore I explain it as referring to the
Jews.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But still there are two senses in which it
may be understood, either that the Prophet reproves their excessive haste, in
impatiently desiring to return, or that the Prophet means that their return to
their native country is immediately at hand, that they may not sink under the
discouragement<i> </i>of long delay; as if he had said, that the time when they
must prepare for departure will speedily arrive. The second of these expositions
has been more generally approved; and I adopt it the more readily, because it
agrees best with the context.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But it may appear
strange that he should say that the people will quickly return, since their
captivity was of long duration. Yet with good reason does God say that that
event will come quickly which he delays till a fit season; for, although to us
it may appear to be long, yet, being appropriate and suitable, the time is
short. And indeed it was a short time, if we look at the condition of that
monarchy, which was so vast and strong that it appeared as if it could never be
destroyed. Thus, what appears to be long in the promises of God will appear to
be short, provided that we do not refuse to lift up our eyes to heaven. This
meaning is confirmed by what immediately
follows.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That he may not die
in a pit. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Such then is God's haste to come
early to deliver his people; that they may come forth safely out of the dungeon.
The Lord does not promise to his people some sudden assistance, that he may only
bring them out of prison, but also that, after having been delivered, they may
be the objects of his kindness; for he promises everything necessary for their
food and support, that they may be convinced that God will always take care of
them; and he is wont not only to assist his people for a moment, but to remain
with them
continually.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>And I am Jehovah thy God. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Again the
Lord declares his power; for so great is the unbelief and sluggishness of men,
that, although it is frequently declared,<i> </i>yet the very<i> </i>smallest
temptation shews that they are not fully convinced of it. They quickly fall back
upon themselves, when they are hard pressed by afflictions; and when they hear
that anything is in the power of God, they do not think that it belongs to
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who divide the sea.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He does not speak in general terms, but brings
forward the instance which he had often mentioned before; for, by once redeeming
the fathers, he held out to posterity the hope of eternal salvation. Justly,
therefore, does he exclaim that he is the same God who long ago "divided<i>
</i>the sea;"<i> </i>and next he magnifies the miracle by saying that its
roaring billows were stilled at his command.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021421&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
14:21.) We ought to know, therefore, that there are no raging billows which God
cannot allay and calm in order to deliver his Church. "It<i> </i>is he who," by
his power, "stills<i> </i>the sea and makes it calm,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;182612&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
26:12,) though it rage furiously; and he likewise drives and swells its waves,
when he thinks fit; though literally, as I have remarked, the Prophet alludes to
the history of the deliverance from Egypt.

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I have put my words in
thy mouth. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He again retums to the doctrine
which he had formerly stated, namely, that the Lord comforts his Church: "I,<i>
</i>I am he that comforteth you," (ver. 12.) So he now says that he put into the
mouth of the prophets what they should say. Hence we may infer that these words
do not proceed from men, who often prove false, but from "God, who cannot lie."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;560102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Titus
1:2.) The Lord speaks to all the prophets, first to Isaiah, and then to the rest
in their order; but at last we must come to Christ. These things must not be
limited either to Isaiah or to Christ, but must be extended to all the prophets.
The Lord wishes that believers should hear the consolation from the prophets, as
if he were present and addressed them, and even declares that he speaks openly
by their mouth.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence also we ought to conclude
that none ought to come forward to comfort the Church but they who speak from
the mouth of the Lord; for they who alter their own dreams, though they take
shelter under the name of God, ought to be rejected. But; we must understand the
Prophet's meaning; for, seeing that he shows that the consciences of men always
tremble, till the Lord confirm them, he instructs us to abide by this principle,
that it is God who speaks by the prophets; for otherwise consciences will always
remain in doubt and uncertainty. Yet the mode of expression is highly emphatic,
when he repeats the commandments of God, by which he was encouraged to the
execution of his office.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
in the shadow of my hand. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Though he had already
said this, yet the repetition is not superfluous, that we may fully believe that
God will always assist his ministers, so that, relying on his immediate aid,
they may be raised by him above all obstructions. Now, in order to being covered
with that shadow of the Lord, two things are necessary; first, that they are
certain that what they utter is the word of God, and secondly, that they do so
by God's command. They who rashly put themselves forward may indeed boast of the
name of God, but in vain; for when they come to fight in earnest, they will
faint. And if we have the testimony of conscience, we have no reason for
entertaining doubts as to God's protection and aid, by which he will enable us
to gain the victory. Next comes the object of the
embassy.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That I may plant the
heavens; </i></font><font face="Palatino">that is, that I may restore everything
to its proper order. There are, indeed, various interpretations of these words;
but the true meaning appears to me to be this, that heaven and earth are said to
be restored by the doctrine of salvation; because "in<i> </i>Christ," as Paul
says, "are<i> </i>collected all things that are either in heaven or in earth."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
1:10.) Since the fall of the first man we see nothing but frightful confusion,
which troubles even the dumb creatures, and makes them suffer, in some respects,
the punishment of our sins; and, consequently, that confusion cannot be repaired
but by Christ. Since therefore the whole face of the world is disfigured by
frightful desolation, there are good grounds for saying that godly teachers
renovate the world, as if God formed heaven and earth anew by their hand. And
hence it is evident how great is the heinousness of our guilt, which has been
followed by such dreadful confusion in the nature of things. Thus, "the heavens"
are said to be "planted and the earth to be founded," when the Lord establishes
his Church by the word; and he does this by the agency of ministers, whom he
directs by his Spirit, and protects against hidden enemies and various dangers,
that they may effectually accomplish what he has
enjoined.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That I may say to
Zion, Thou art my people. </i></font><font face="Palatino">At length he shews
that this aims at something higher than the visible form of the world, which
shall quickly perish; namely, to excite and nourish in the hearts of believers
the hope of a heavenly life. The true stability of the Church, the restoration
of the world, consists in this, that the elect be gathered into the unity of
faith, so that, with one consent, all may lift their hearts to God, who also
invites them sweetly and gently by these words, "I<i> </i>am thy God." And hence
we see how highly God values the salvation of the Church, since he not only
prefers it to the whole world, but even shews that the stability of the world
depends upon it. We must likewise observe what is the word which the Lord
enjoins to be proclaimed; for it not only lays down a rule of life, but also
gives a testimony of our adoption, in which our salvation chiefly
consists.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>Awake, awake. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The Church was about
to endure grievous calamities, and therefore he fortifies her by consolation,
and meets a doubt which might arise, that the Jews, being now oppressed by
tyrants, saw no fulfillment of these promises. The meaning therefore is, that
the Church, though afflicted and tossed in various ways, will nevertheless be
set up again, so as to regain her full vigor. By the word "Awake"<i> </i>he
recalls her, as it were, from death and the grave; as if he had said, that no
ruins shall be so dismal, no desolations shall be so horrible, as to be capable
of hindering God from effecting this restoration. And this consolation was
highly necessary; for when grief seizes our hearts, we think that the promises
do not at all belong to us; and therefore we ought frequently to call to
remembrance, and to place constantly before our eyes,<i> </i>that it is God who
speaks, and who addresses men who are not in a prosperous or flourishing
condition, but fallen and dead, and whom notwithstanding he can raise up and
uphold by his word; for this doctrine of salvation is intended not for those who
retain their original condition, but for those who are dead and
ruined.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who hast drunk from
the hand of Jehovah the cup of his wrath. </i></font><font face="Palatino">There
are two senses in which the term, "cup of wrath," may be understood; for
sometimes the Lord is said to put into our hands a "cup of wrath,"<i> </i>when
he strikes us with some kind of giddiness, or deranges our intellect; as we see
that affliction sometimes takes away men's understanding; but sometimes it is
used in a simpler sense, to denote the sharp and heavy punishments by which the
Lord severely chastises his people. This is evidently the meaning in which it
must be taken here, as appears from the addition of the pronoun <i>His. </i>Nor
is this inconsistent with what he says, that the Church was stupified and drunk;
for he shews that this happened in consequence of the Lord having severely
chastised her. It is an ordinary metaphor by which the chastisement which God
inflicts on his people is called a "potion," 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F875</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
or a certain measure which he assigns to each. But whenever it relates to the
elect, this term "cup" serves to express the moderation of the divine judgment;
that the Lord, though he punish his people severely, still observes a limit. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F876</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pressing
out the dregs of the cup of distress </i></font><font face="Palatino">(or <i>of
trembling.) </i>I consider the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hl[rt</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>(targnelah) </i>to denote "anguish"<i> </i>or "trembling," by which men are
nearly struck dead, when they are weighed down by heavy calamities. Such persons
may be called "drunk," as having exhausted all that is in the cup, because
nothing can be added to their affliction and
distress.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This is also denoted by another term,
"pressing out." The Church is here reminded that all the evils which befall her
proceed from no other source than from the hand of God, that she may not think
that they happen to her by chance, or that she is unjustly afflicted. The object
which the Prophet has in view is, that the people may know that they are justly
punished for their sins. No one can rise up till he first acknowledge that he
has fallen, or be delivered from misery till he perceive that it is by his own
fault that he is miserable. In short, there can be no room for consolations till
they have been preceded by the doctrine of
repentance.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Dregs,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">therefore, must not here be understood in the
same sense as in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;242515&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
25:15, where the reprobate are spoken of, whom the Lord chokes and kills by his
cup, but as denoting complete and righteous punishment, to which the Lord has
been pleased to assign a limit. Thus, when the Lord has inflicted on us such
punishment as he thought fit, and puts an end to our afflictions, he declares
that the "dregs"<i> </i>are exhausted; as we have seen before at the fortieth
chapter. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F877</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There is no one to guide her.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He describes the sorest calamity of the Church;
for the heaviest and sorest of all undoubtedly is, that she receives no sympathy
or consolation from her own children. This accumulated misery is described by
him, in order that, though her condition be desperate, she may still expect
consolation from God, who will never disappoint his servants, though they be
sunk to the depth of hell. Although the Church has been forsaken by men, and
even by those whom she nourished in her bosom and carried in her arms, yet she
shall receive assistance from God. No affliction more severe can befall a mother
than to be deserted by her children, who ought in their turn to have treated her
with kindness. Such ingratitude and want of natural affection is certainly much
liarder to bear than the violent and unbridled cruelty of enemies; for why does
she give birth to children, and why does she bring them up, but in expectation
of being supported by them in return? Since her children do not perform their
duty, what remains but that she shall think that to have born and reared them
has been of no advantage to her? Although therefore the Church has performed the
duty of a mother, and has brought up her children to the age of maturity, yet
the Prophet declares that she must not expect any assistance or consolation from
ungrateful persons.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet his discourse conveys
something more, and pronounces those children who have rendered no assistance to
their mother to be bastards and reprobates, with the view of inducing her to
bear the loss of them more patiently. It was sad and distressing for the Church
to be deprived of all her offspring, and to be reduced to childlessness; though
this has sometimes happened. But the Prophet reminds the mother that the
children do not deserve that she should mourn for them, and that, on the
contrary, she ought to desire additional offspring, as it is said by the
Psalmist,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The people that shall be

<div><font face="Palatino">What is here described by the Prophet is entirely
applicable to our own age; for many boast of being the children of the Church;
but where is the man that cares about his mother's distresses? Who is grieved
for her ruin? Who is moved so deeply as to put his shoulders to her support? How
many betray her, and, under presence of this title, persecute her more cruelly
than open and avowed enemies? Accordingly, after all her calamities this is
added as the copestone of her miseries. Moreover, they who wish to be regarded
as holding the first rank in the Church, and who not only boast of being
children, but vaunt of being called fathers, treacherously<i> </i>desert her
when she implores their aid. We need not wonder, therefore, if God shall drive
them out, in order to make way for the increase of his Church by lawful and
dutiful children.

<div><font face="Palatino">But here Isaiah promises to the Church that there
shall eventually be a different issue; for the Lord will rescue her from the
deepest abyss. He threatens extreme wretchedness, that believers may gird
themselves for patience, and not cease to send upwards prayers and supplications
from the depth of their distresses. The general meaning is, that the Church
shall be burdened with afflictions of every kind, so that she shall appear to be
on the brink of utter ruin; because from without she shall endure very heavy
calamities, and from within shall obtain no aid or sympathy from her own
children. These are two very sore evils which the Prophet relates. But it
appears as if the division were not quite appropriate; for, after having related
one evil, that there is none <i>to bewail her, </i>he enumerates four kinds
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Desolation and
destruction, and the sword and famine. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Some
explain it to mean that the Church is visited by famine within, and harassed by
enemies without. But I interpret it differently, as I have already hinted; for
it is very customary among Hebrew writers to put a question, when they wish
absolutely to deny anything; and among them it is elegant, though in Greek or
Latin authors it would be ungraceful. Isaiah therefore describes "two evils,"
one external, for both by the devastations of "war" and by "famine" they will be
brought to the verge of "destruction" and "desolation,"<i> </i>which he
describes by these four classes; and another internal, because she is deprived
of consolation, and "there<i> </i>is none to bewail her." By putting the
question, "Who<i> </i>shall bewail her?" he affirms that she shall have no
consolation; and this verse agrees with the former, in which we have already
explained the design which the Prophet has in view, in describing this highly
calamitous and wretched condition of the
Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy sons have fainted.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He describes more fully the lamentable and
wretched condition of the Church, when he says that her children he prostrate. A
mother cannot be visited with any grief more bitter than to have her children
slain before her eyes, and not one or two of them, but so great a number as to
fill the roads with the
slaughter.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As a wild bull in a
net. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The metaphor is taken from bears or other
savage animals, by which he means that even the strongest of them have, as it
were, been caught in
snares.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Full of the
indignation of Jehovah. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By this expression he
distinctly states that none of these events are accidental, lest they should
suppose that any of them has happened by chance, or lest they should accuse the
Lord of cruelty for having punished them severely; because his judgment is just
and righteous. This is what he means, when he says that this punishment has
proceeded from <i>the rebuke </i>of the Lord. Yet we must bear in mind his
object which I have already mentioned, that believers ought not to throw away
the hope of grace, though innumerable calamities prompt and urge them to
despair.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.

spoke of the calamities of the Church. It was, that believers might be fully
persuaded that they would obtain consolation from God, though they were reduced
to the extremity of distress. But why does he call the Church <i>wretched,
</i>since nothing is more happy than to be God's people, and that happiness
cannot be taken away by any tribulations?; Not without cause is it
said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Blessed is the people

<div><font face="Palatino">I reply, she is apparently "wretched," and not in
vain does the Lord address her by that name; for, as we have already said, he
helps the wretched, and succors the
destitute.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And drunken, not
with wine.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F879</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>When he calls her "drunken," it ought to be observed that believers never
endure so patiently the chastisements which are inflicted on them as not to be
sometimes stupified; but, although stupified, they ought to remember that the
Lord punishes them justly, and ought to believe that the Lord will assist them.
He does not speak to robust or healthy men, but to those who are feeble,
wretched, prostrate, and who resemble drunken persons, and says that he brings
to them consolation. Finally, by this word he soothes the grief of the Church,
and shews that he preserves a limit, by which he restrains the violence even of
the greatest afflictions, and restores her when ruined, as if he were raising
from the dead a rotten corpse.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith Jehovah.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Not at random does the Prophet add to the name
Jehovah three epithets, namely, that he is the <i>Lord </i>or Defender of his
Church, that he is <i>God, </i>and lastly, that he is her <i>Avenger. </i>We
ought always to consider what is the nature of our relation to God; for he
addresses us in a familiar manner, in consequence of having once chosen us to be
his people, by uniting himself to us in an everlasting covenant. This preface
encouraged the Jews, in ancient times, not to hesitate to embrace what is here
promised; and at the present day the same argument applies to a new people, who
have been taken under God's care and protection not less than they. The Lord
declares himself to hold the office of an "Avenger,"<i> </i>in order that, when
we shall be threatened with the most alarming dangers, and when it shall appear
as if all were over with us, we may betake ourselves to this anchor, that God is
the "Avenger" of his people; and this ought to support us, not only when we are
assailed by outward enemies, but also when we are assailed by
Satan.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I have taken
from thy hand. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He holds out the ground of hope;
for it is only by temporary stripes that the Lord chastises his Church. Hence
also the Jews ought to learn that all the calamities to which they were
subjected were the just reward of their transgressions; for those calamities
would never come to an end but by their being reconciled to God. The general
meaning is, that the wrath of the Lord will be appeased, so that he will
restrain and bring to a close the chastisements which he had formerly inflicted
on his Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The cup of thy
affliction, </i></font><font face="Palatino">or,<i> the cup of thy trembling.
</i>We have already spoken of the metaphor of "the<i> </i>cup;" and the
explanation of it which we gave is fully confirmed by this passage, in which God
calls it "the<i> </i>cup of his indignation," though it had made the Church to
tremble, as if she had been seized with giddiness. Yet it is the same word which
he formerly used,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hl[rt</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>(targnelah,) </i>which some translate "anguish," and others "trembling." By
<i>dregs, </i>as I have said, he means the full measure of vengeance with which
God is satisfied on account of his fatherly
kindness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will put it into the
hand of thy oppressors. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This is another part of
the consolation, in which he promises that the Lord will not only deliver the
Church from those heavy distresses, but will also lay upon her enemies the
calamities with which she is afflicted. If therefore we are afflicted, 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F880</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
our condition will be speedily changed, and our enemies will be severely
punished. Truly, as Paul says, it is righteous with God to render tribulation to
them that trouble you, and to you who are troubled rest along with us, when the
Lord shall be revealed from heaven, with the angels of his power, with flame of
fire, to take vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel
of our Lord Jesus Christ."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;530106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Thessalonians 1:6-8.) Thus the temporary punishments which God inflicts on them
are the beginnings of that eternal punishment to which they shall be finally
condemned.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who said to thy
soul. </i></font><font face="Palatino">In order to describe more fully the
insolence and haughtiness of their enemies, such as we too experience every day
in our adversaries, he quotes their words, by which they slandered and insulted
the unhappy children of God. Impiety is always accompanied by pride and cruelty;
for, as the true knowledge of God renders men gentle, so ignorance makes them
ferocious and savage. They who are ignorant of God please themselves, and pour
out unmeasured reproaches against God and those who truly worship him. This
truly is most wretched and base; but since he frequently permits his name to be
exposed to the insults of wicked men, let us not wonder that we are assailed on
account of his name; for we are not more excellent than God, and our condition
ought not to be better than that of the ancient Church. David employs a
different metaphor,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19C903&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
129:3,) when he says that the Church resembles a field which is cut and broken
up by the plough; for he shews that frequently it is deeply furrowed and trodden
upon, that we may not think that our condition is different.</font><br></div>

</i></b><i>Awake, awake. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He confirms the former
doctrine, in order still more to arouse the people who had been weighed down by
grief and sorrow. These things were necessary to be added as spurs, that the
doctrine might more easily penetrate into their drowsy and stupified hearts; for
he addresses the Church, which appeared to be in a benumbed and drowsy
condition, and bids her "awake," that she may collect her strength and revive
her courage, he repeats it a second time, and with great propriety; for it is
difficult to arouse and reanimate those whose hearts have been struck, and even
laid prostrate, by a sense of God's
anger.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Put on thy strength.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">As if he had said, "Formerly<i> </i>thou wast
dejected, and wallowedst in filth and pollution; now prepare for a happy and
prosperous condition, to which the Lord will restore thee." Thus he contrasts
<i>"strength" </i>with despondency, such as is usually found when affairs are
desperate; and he contrasts
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>garments of
beauty</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>with filth and
pollution.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For henceforth
there shall not come to thee. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The reason
assigned by him is, that henceforth God will not permit wicked men to indulge
their sinful inclinations for destroying it. Freed from their tyranny, the
Church already has cause to rejoice; and security for the future holds out solid
ground for joy and gladness. Yet Isaiah exhorts us to mutual congratulation when
God is reconciled to his Church; and indeed if we have any piety in us, we ought
to be deeply affected by her condition, that we may rejoice in her prosperity,
and be grieved in her adversity. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F881</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In short, it ought to be the height of our gladness, as also the Psalmist
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Let my tongue cleave to
my jaws, if I remember not thee, and if thou be not the crown of my gladness."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D706&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
137:6.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By the word <i>come, </i>he means what we commonly
express by the phrase, <i>(Avoir e entree,) </i>"to<i> </i>have
access."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By the uncircumcised
and unclean, </i></font><font face="Palatino">he means all irreligious persons
who corrupt the worship of God and oppress consciences by tyranny. It was
customary to apply the term "uncircumcised" to all who were estranged from the
Church, which had for its symbol "circumcision," by which all believers were
distinguished. But as very many persons, though they bore this outward mark of
the covenant, were not better than others, in order to remove all doubt, he
added the word "unclean;" for the mark of "circumcision is nothing in itself,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
5:6,) and (unless, as Paul says, there be added purity of heart) "is even
reckoned uncircumcision."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
2:2.5,) Accordingly, he declares that henceforth such persons shall not be
admitted into the Church, in order that, by the removal of corruptions, and the
restoration of the worship of God, she may possess perfect joy. Yet I do not
object to viewing these words as applied to outward foes, whom he calls by
hateful names, that even the severity of the punishment may warn the Jews of the
heinousness of their
offenses.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>Shake thyself from the dust; arise.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He explains more fully the deliverance of the
Church, and exhibits it prominently by
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">uJpotu&gt;pwsin</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>"a lively description." When he bids her "shake<i> </i>off the dust and
arise," let us not on that account think that our liberty is in our power, so
that we can obtain it whenever we think fit; for it belongs to God alone to
raise us from the dust, to lift us up when we are prostrate, and, by breaking or
loosing our chains, to set us at liberty. Why then does the Prophet make use of
the imperative mood? for it is unreasonable to demand what we cannot perform. I
reply, the imperative form of address has a much more powerful tendency to
arouse than if he had employed plain narrative; and therefore he declares that,
when God shall have restored her to her former freedom, she shall come out of
the mire.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sit, O Jerusalem,.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">The word "sit" denotes a flourishing condition,
and is contrasted with the word "to<i> </i>lie," which denotes the lowest
calamity. Sometimes indeed it means "to<i> </i>be prostrate," as when he
formerly said to Babylon, "sit in the dust."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
47:1.) But here the meaning is different; for, after ordering her to arise, he
likewise adds, "that<i> </i>she may sit;" that is, that she may no longer lie
down, but may regain her former condition, and not be in future laid prostrate
by
enemies.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>For thus saith Jehovah. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This verse
has been badly expounded by many commentators, who have here chosen to enter
into philosophical subtleties; for they have dreamed of many things at variance
with the Prophet's meaning. It agrees with what he had formerly
stated,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"To which of my creditors
have I sold you?"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
1:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For here, in the same manner, he says,<i>
"</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye</i> <i>have been sold for
nought</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;" </i>as if he had said that he has
received no price, and is under no obligations to a creditor who can claim them
as having been purchased by him. This tends greatly to confirm the promise;
because the Jews might entertain doubts of the liberty which was promised to
them, in consequence of their having been long held in possession by the
Babylonians, who were the most powerful of all nations. The Lord meets this
doubt. "I<i> </i>did not sell or make a conveyance of you to them; for nought
were ye sold; and therefore I can justly claim you as nay property and sell you.
Do not then consider how great are your difficulties, when I promise you
liberty, and do not reason on this matter by human arguments; for the
Babylonians have no right to detain you, and cannot prevent your being set at
liberty.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore shall ye be
redeemed without money. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Lastly, as he had
formerly said, that he is not like a spendthrift, who is compelled to sell his
children, or offer them in payment, so in this passage he declares that "for<i>
</i>nought he sold" and gave them up to their enemies, for no other reason than
because they had provoked him by their sins; and therefore that there will be no
greater difficulty in delivering them than in giving them up to their
enemies.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Some explain it more ingeniously thus,
that Christ has redeemed us by free grace. This doctrine must indeed be
maintained, but does not agree with the Prophet's meaning, who intended to
correct the distrust of the Jews, that they might have no doubt as to their
being set at liberty. Let it suffice to know, that when God shall be pleased to
deliver his people, it will not be necessary to make a pecuniary bargain with
the Babylonians, whom, in spite of their opposition, he will have no difficulty
in driving out of their unjust
possession.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>Into Egypt my people went down aforetime.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Here also the commentators touch neither heaven
nor earth; for the Jews dream of three captivities, and Christians differ from
them by thinking that this denotes a third captivity, which shall be under
Antichrist, and from which Christ will deliver them. But the Prophet's meaning,
in my opinion, is quite different; for he argues from the less to the greater,
by quoting the instance of the Egyptian captivity, from which the people were
formerly recalled by the wonderful power of God.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021428&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
14:28.) The argument therefore stands thus: "If<i> </i>the Lord punished the
Egyptians because their treatment of his people was harsh and unjust,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011514&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
15:14,) much more will he punish the Babylonians, who have cruelly tyrannized
over them."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the Assyrian
has oppressed them without cause. </i></font><font face="Palatino">There was
much greater plausibility in Pharaoh's claim of dominion over the Jews than in
that of the Babylonians; for Jacob, having voluntarily come down to Egypt with
his family,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
46:5,) undoubtedly became subject to the power of Pharaoh, who, in return for
the kindness received from Joseph, 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F882</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
had assigned to him a large country and abundant pasturage. Pharaoh's
successors, ungrateful and forgetful of the benefit conferred on them by Joseph,
afflicted all the posterity of Jacob in various ways. This ingratitude and
cruelty the Lord severely punished. But far more base and savage was the
wickedness of the Babylonians, who drove the Jews out of a lawful possession,
and dragged them into bondage. If then the Lord could not bear the Egyptians,
who were unthankful and ruled by unjust laws, though in other respects they had
a just title to possession, much less will he endure the violent and cruel
Babylonians, who have no right to govern his people and oppress them by
tyranny.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By "the<i> </i>Assyrian," he means the
Babylonians, who were united under the same monarchy with the Assyrians; but he
takes special notice of "the Assyrian,"<i> </i>because he was the first that
grievously distressed the Jews, and that prepared the way for this
captivity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>What have I here? </i></font><font face="Palatino">He follows out and
confirms what I have already said, that it; is not reasonable that he should
silently permit his people to be any longer oppressed. By these words he
reproves, in some measure, his own delay; as if he had said, "Shall I not
stretch out my hand? Shall I not avenge my people? If Pharaoh did not hinder me,
though he was a lawful master, shall the violence of robbers hinder me?" He next
enumerates the reasons which ought to move him to bring back the
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That my people should
be carried away for nought. </i></font><font face="Palatino">There must be
understood an implied contrast to the participle "carried<i> </i>away;" for the
Egyptians did not "carry<i> </i>away" Jacob by force; he came down to it of his
own accord when he was pressed by famine, yet he was delivered from it; 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F883</font></sup><font face="Palatino">how
much more shall he be rescued out of the hand of those who tore him from his
native country, and carried him by violence into
captivity?</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they should
cause them to howl. </i></font><font face="Palatino">In order to express more
forcibly the baseness of this conduct, he says that they are constrained to howl
without ceasing. Some translate the vero as neuter; 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F884</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but I think that it is intended to express the strength of their hatred, and
therefore I consider it to be an active verb, expressive of the violence which
the Babylonians exercised towards the Jews; for they not only ruled unjustly
over them, but also treated them harshly. To "howl" is more than to sigh or
weep; for there is reason to believe that the pain which sends forth loud and
strong cries is exceedingly severe. The metaphor is taken from wild beasts, and
denotes extreme despair.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The third and principal
reason why the Lord will deliver his people is, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his name is continually exposed
to the reproach</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and blasphemy of wicked
men. For the sake of his own honor the Lord preserves the Church, and defends
the pure worship of his name. Because<i> </i>wicked men seize on the Church's
calamitous state as a reason for blasphemy, and insolently mock God, with good
reason does he say, that by delivering his people, he will plead his own cause.
I do not here relate the various interpretations, or stay to refute them; for it
will be enough for me to have briefly explained the Prophet's real
meaning.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>Therefore shall my people know. </i></font><font face="Palatino">In
this verse he concludes what he had glanced at in the two preceding verses, that
at length the people must be redeemed by God, who cannot be unlike himself; for,
if he redeemed the fathers, if he always assisted the Church, their posterity,
whom he has adopted in the same manner, will never be suffered by him to be
overwhelmed. We ought carefully to observe the word "know;" for to "know<i>
</i>the name of the Lord" is to lay aside every false opinion, and to know him
from his word, which is his true image, and next from his works. We must not
imagine God according to the fancy of men, but must comprehend him as he
declares himself to us. The Lord, therefore, concludes that he will actually
assist them, and will fulfill all that he has promised, that the people may know
that their hope has not been without foundation, and that they may be more and
more confirmed in the knowledge of his name. We must keep in remembrance what we
have elsewhere said about experimental knowledge, which confirms the truth of
the word.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That it is I who
speak. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The verb "to speak"<i> </i>relates to
the promises.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ynnh</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
(hinni,) </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold
I,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>relates to actual power; as if he had
said, "Although<i> </i>now there be nothing more than that there sound in your
ears the words by which I promise what is hardly probable, yet you shall
speedily obtain it; for I will actually accomplish what I promise." Hence we
ought to draw the universal doctrine, that the promises of God and the
fulfillment of them are linked together by an indissoluble bond. Whenever,
therefore, Satan tempts and urges us to distrust, as if God had forsaken and
abandoned us, we must come back to this point, and place our confidence in God,
who never promises anything in vain. "If hitherto he does not perform, yet he
will assist in due
time."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>How beautiful upon the mountains.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet again confirms believers as to the
certainty of the word of God, that they may be fully persuaded that they shall
be restored to their former liberty, and may comfort their hearts by assured
hope during that hard bondage. He pronounces magnificent commendations on this
message, that believers may be convinced that God holds out to them, in their
calamity, the hope of future salvation; and indeed, when God speaks, they ought
to accept the consolation, that, relying on it, they may calmly and patiently
wait for the fulfillment of the promise. Thus, in order that believers may
bridle their desires by patience, he splendidly adorns the word of God. "Will
you be so ungrateful as not to rest satisfied with that incomparable treasure of
the word which contains so many benefits? Will you give way to unruly passions?
Will you complain of God?" He wishes to guard against distrust the people who
were drawn away by various allurements, and did not fully rely on the word of
God; and therefore he praises the excellence<i> </i>of the doctrine, and shews
that the Lord bestows upon "us more than we can say or think."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490320&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
3:20.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">He states that he does not now speak of
every kind of doctrine, but of that which is adapted to consolation, and
therefore shews that "beautiful" and lovely is the approach of those who bring
consolation from the mouth of God, which can not only alleviate our grief, but
even impart to us abundant joy. Here he speaks of the doctrine of salvation, and
consequently says that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>peace,
happiness, salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is proclaimed. By
the word "peace" he denotes a prosperous and happy condition, as we have already
in other passages explained fully the signification of this
term.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That saith to Zion.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Hence we infer what is the beginning of that
doctrine which Isaiah preaches, and what we ought chiefly to desire, namely,
that the kingdom of God may be erected among us; for until he reign among us,
everything must go in with us, and therefore we must be miserable, as, on the
other hand, when God is pleased to take care of us, this of itself is the chief
part of salvation; and this, too, is the only way of obtaining peace, though the
state of affairs be ruinous and desperate. And let us remember that this message
is sent to the Church; for it cannot apply to heathens that know not
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Paul quotes this passage, in order to prove
that the preaching of the Gospel proceeds not from men but from God, and that
the ministers who bring the message of salvation are sent by him. He employs
this chain of reasoning, &#8212; "Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord
shall be saved. But it is impossible for any one to call on God till he know
him; for there can be no entrance to calling on him till it is opened up by
faith, that, embracing God as our Father, we may familiarly pour our cares into
his bosom. Now, the foundation of it is doctrine, by which the Lord has revealed
himself to us, and for that purpose employs the agency and ministry of men.
Therefore he adds, lastly, that there will be none to preach till he be sent by
God."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451015&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:15.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">But it may be thought that Paul tortures
the Prophet's words; for Isaiah does not say that God sends ministers, but that
their approach and presence is desirable. I reply, Paul took this principle for
granted, that nothing is desirable but what comes from God. But whence comes
salvation? From men? No; for none but God can be the author of such a
distinguished benefit. Justly, therefore, does he conclude that it proceeds from
God, and not from
man.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>

continues his argument; for he shews that there shall be such a restoration of
the people, that the messengers shall venture boldly to proclaim it. To
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lift up the
voice</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>has the same meaning with the
phrase, "on the mountains," which he formerly employed. (Verse 7.) The matter
will not be hidden, but so clear and evident as to draw forth universal
admiration. They who speak of what is doubtful matter mutter inaudibly, 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F885</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and do not venture to "lift up the voice;" but here there will be nothing
doubtful or uncertain.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet borrowed the
metaphor from sentries which are commonly placed in cities, though the
designation of "watchmen" is usually given to all Prophets, because they are
placed, as it were, on watch-towers, to keep watch over the safety of the
people. When he says that they shall lift up the voice, he means that there will
be silence during the captivity, because the voice of the Prophets shall not be
heard; for although they warn every one privately, yet there will be no freedom
of speech. Hence also Jeremiah says, "I will put my mouth in the dust."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;250329&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Lamentations
3:29) But when the Lord shall be pleased to lead forth the people, the mouth of
watchmen, who were formerly dumb, shall be opened to proclaim that they are at
liberty to return; for they will not speak within private walls, or impart
moderate consolation, but will openly proclaim that salvation. On this subject I
have spoken fully at the beginning of the fortieth chapter.  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F886</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Eye
to eye</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, openly. This extends, indeed,
to spiritual conversion; but let us not on that account depart from the literal
sense, so as not to include also the benefit which the Lord conferred on the
ancient people; for, when he restored the Jews to liberty, and employed the
ministry of Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, these things were fulfilled. Yet at
the same time they ought to be continued down to the coming of Christ, by which
the Church was gathered out of all parts of the world. But we ought also to go
forward to Christ's last coming, by which all things shall be perfectly
restored.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Praise ye, rejoice
together.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He exhorts believers to thanksgiving,
but chiefly confirms them in the hope and confidence of this salvation; as if
the actual enjoyment of it already called them to thank God for it.  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F887</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
We are not sufficiently moved, when the Lord testifies that he will assist us,
and think that we are deceived, if he do not actually show it. On this account
the Prophets insist much on strengthening the hearts of believers, and placing
the fact almost before their eyes. Although it appears to be unreasonable and
inappropriate to prescribe a song of joy in the midst of grief, yet we have
elsewhere seen that this form of expression is well fitted to arouse those who
groan under the burden of sorrow, fear, and
cares.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye wildernesses of
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He calls them "wildernesses" or
waste places "of Jerusalem," that, notwithstanding its ruin and destruction,
they might still hope that it would be restored. And this appellation is better
adapted for shaking off fear than if he had called her prosperous or
flourishing; for, in consequence of their condition being very wretched, nothing
would have led them to think that these promises related to them except a
description of their misery, against which they needed to be fortified, in order
that, though they beheld nothing but desolation and hideous ruin, still they
might look for restoration with assured
confidence.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For Jehovah hath
comforted his people</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Lord hath changed the
mourning of the people into joy, and out of captivity hath made them free. Yet
some person will say  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F888</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that this had not yet happened. But in the promises of God, as in a mirror, we
ought to behold those things which are not yet visible to our eyes, even though
they appear to us to be contrary to
reason.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He hath redeemed
Jerusalem. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Here we see that to deliver the
Church is God's own work. And if we ought to judge thus of the redemption from
Babylon, which was but of a shadowy nature, what shall we say of the spiritual
redemption? Can it be ascribed to men without grossly insulting God? As it
belongs to God alone to deliver the Church, so to him it likewise belongs to
defend its liberty.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah hath made bare the
arm of his holiness. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet has borrowed
this comparison from soldiers who stretch out their arms when they make ready
for the battle. To "make bare" does not here mean to hold out the naked arm, but
to exert it; because, when we sit in idleness, we either have our arms folded or
conceal them; and in like manner, we conceive of God according to the grossness
of our senses, and think that, like a wearied or indolent man, he does not move
a finger till he publicly displays his
power.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet calls it "the arm of
holiness," because he intended to display his power for the salvation of the
people. This implies a mutual relation between God and the Church which the Lord
has consecrated to himself. True, "he maketh bare his arm" in the government of
the whole world; but he does not call it "the arm of holiness," as in this
passage, when he renders peculiar assistance to his Church. There are two points
of view in which the power of God ought to be regarded; first, universally, in
preserving all the creatures; next, specially, in defending the Church; for
there is a peculiar care which he exercises about his own people, and which the
rest do not share with
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Before the eyes of all
nations. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He means that this deliverance shall
be worthy of so great admiration that it shall be visible even to the blind. The
extension of this magnificent spectacle to the very ends of the earth makes it
evident that the Prophet does not. speak of the return of the people, which
would take place a few years afterwards, but of the restoration of the whole
Church. This prophecy is maliciously restricted by the Jews to the deliverance
from Babylon, and is improperly restricted by Christians to the spiritual
redemption which we obtain through Christ; for we must begin with the
deliverance which was wrought under Cyrus,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;143622&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 36:22, 23,) and bring it down to our own time. Thus the Lord began to
display his power among the Medes and Persians, but afterwards he made it
visible to all the nations.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Depart ye, depart ye.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He now exhorts the people to be always ready to
set out, and at the same time to bear their misery with patience. As the
excessive haste of the people needed to be restrained, so it was also proper to
shake off their slothfulness; for, before the time of deliverance arrived, they
burned with extravagant eagerness to depart; but when the period of the
captivity was fulfilled, they had grown languid through long delay, and had
thrown away all hope and wish to return, so that there were few who returned to
Judea.  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F889</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
They had mingled with the Babylonians, whose customs had captivated and depraved
them so much that they disregarded their native country; and therefore they
needed to be aroused and admonished, that they might not lose heart through long
expectation, and might not suffer themselves to be corrupted by the pollutions
of the Babylonians.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Touch not
what is unclean. </i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F890</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This expresses more clearly what we have already said. He bids them keep
themselves pure and free from the defilements with which the Babylonians
polluted themselves; for there was a risk of their being corrupted by the
pollutions of the Gentiles, as we are all prone to evil, and easily led away by
bad examples. Accordingly, he exhorts them, though they are captives, not to do
anything for the purpose of pleasing their masters, or of having their condition
improved; not to allow themselves to be drawn aside from the pure worship of
God; not to be polluted by their idolatries; not to pretend that they worship
idols or approve of their religion; for this is detestable "uncleanness," which
the Prophet bids them shun. Captives and those who groan under tyranny meet with
temptations of this kind, under which they frequently sink so as to allow
themselves to do many things that are unlawful and base, under the pretense of
wishing to mitigate the rage of tyrants. But how frivolous their excuse is we
see in this passage; for the Prophet does not exhort the Jews to be clean when
they shall be free, but so long as they shall be held captive, and even when
their life shall be in danger. These words undoubtedly relate to us also, whom
Paul exhorts to be unpolluted, not only "in spirit," but also "in the flesh."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 7:1).</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be ye clean,
that bear the vessels of Jehovah. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This
exhortation is especially directed to the priests and Levites, who, being
standard-bearers, ought to maintain greater integrity; not that others have a
right to pollute themselves, but he addresses them chiefly, that they may give
an example to others, to whom they have been appointed to be guides. Besides, we
must bear in remembrance what we have already seen, and what Isaiah will again
repeat at the end of this book, that there will be a new priesthood among a
redeemed people.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;236621&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
66:21.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet I approve of the simple meaning,
that the Levites and ministers of the temple are put, by way of eminence,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">katj
ejxoch&lt;n</font><font face="Palatino">) for the whole of the people. This
doctrine, therefore, relates in the present day, not only to ministers of the
word, but to all Christians, who are also called "a royal priesthood,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 2:9,) and not only are appointed to carry the vessels of the temple, but
are themselves "temples of God." (1 Corinthians 16, and 6:19.) Thus Ezekiel has
predicted that at the restoration of the Church the Levites shall be high
priests, and the whole people shall be admitted into the order of the Levites.
Seeing, therefore, that the Lord has raised all to so high a rank of dignity, it
follows that this "cleanness" is demanded from all without exception; and on
this account also Paul has applied this passage to the whole
Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For not in haste shall ye go
out. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet again magnifies that benefit
of redemption, for it appeared to be incredible, so deep was the despair with
which almost all of them had been seized; for he chiefly addresses those who
would be led into captivity, that they might not lose courage in that wretched
condition. He promises that this deliverance shall not resemble a flight such as
that of Egypt; for there is an implied contrast between the deliverance from
Egypt. and the deliverance from Babylon. They fled "by night" out of Egypt,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021231&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
12:31,) having pretended that they were only performing "a journey of three days
to offer sacrifice to God."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;020503&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
5:3.) They went out "with haste"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021233&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
12:33) and bustle, as they were told to do, and Pharaoh pursued them in their
journey and attempted to destroy them. But the Prophet declares that the present
case shall be totally different, and that they shall go away like conquerors, so
that none shall venture to give them any annoyance, or, as we commonly say,
"They will go out with flying colors," (<i>Ils s'en iront a enseigne
desployee,</i>) so that this deliverance will be more excellent and
wonderful.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah will go
before you</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, will be the leader of your
journey. It will be said that God was also the leader of his ancient people when
he led them out of Egypt. This is undoubtedly true; but he did not at that time
display his majesty, as now, when, like a general, he brought back his army,
after having vanquished his
enemies.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the God of Israel
will assemble you. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The word "assemble" will
confirm the interpretation now given; for there will be no scattering such as
usually takes place when men are under the influence of terror, nor will they
wander about here and there, but will march, as under banners, in a regular and
ordinary manner. As if he had said, "God will bring you out as a band or army
drawn up; one shall not follow another, like those who steal away secretly; but
ye shall be openly gathered in troops, and shall depart without any fear. None
shall molest you; for you will be assembled under God as your leader, that you
may return into your native country.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.

prosperous success</i></font><font face="Palatino">.  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F891</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
After having spoken of the restoration of the Church, Isaiah passes on to
Christ, in whom all things are gathered together. Some explain
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lyk&ccedil;y</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>yashkil</i>) to mean shall "deal prudently;" but, as it is immediately added
that he shall be exalted, the context appears to demand that we shall rather
understand it to denote "prosperous success," for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lk&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>shakal</i>) also signifies "to be prosperous." He speaks, therefore, of the
prosperity of the Church; and as this was not visible, he draws their attention
to the supreme King, by whom all things shall be restored, and bids them wait
for him. And here we ought carefully to observe the contrasts which the Prophet
lays down; for the mightiness of this king whom the Lord will exalt is
contrasted by him with the wretched and debased condition of the people, who
were almost in despair. He promises that this king will be the head of the
people, so that under him as the leader the people shall flourish, though they
be now in a state of the deepest affliction and wretchedness; because he shall
have a prosperous course.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He calls Christ "his
Servant," on account of the office committed to him. Christ ought not to be
regarded as a private individual, but as holding the office to which the Father
has appointed him, to be leader of the people and restorer of all things; so
that whatever he affirms concerning himself we ought to understand as belonging
also to us. Christ has been given to us, and therefore to us also belongs his
ministry, for the Prophet might have said, in a single word, that Christ will be
exalted and will be highly honored; but, by giving to him the title of
"Servant," he means that he will be exalted for our
sake.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.

exalted state of Christ was not visible at first sight, and on this pretense it
might be rejected. On this account, he informs them that Christ must first be
rejected and humbled, and anticipates that doubt which might have arisen from
his singularly debased and unseemly condition. As if he had said, "There is no
reason why men should be shocked at that unseemliness and disgrace which will be
speedily followed by eternal
happiness."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So marred by men.

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">m</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>mem</i>) to be a particle denoting comparison, as others explain it; that is
"more than" men, or "beyond" what is usually found among men; but I adopt a
simpler meaning, which is, that Christ was disfigured among men, or that his
beauty was defaced by the perverse judgment of
men.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Were amazed.
</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F893</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This "amazement" is considered by some commentators to denote the astonishment
with which men were seized on account of the miracles performed by Christ, and
next, that, when he must come to the cross, he was immediately rejected by them.
But they have not caught the Prophet's meaning; for he says that Christ will be
such that all men will be shocked at him. He came into the world so as to be
everywhere despised; his glory lay hid under the humble form of the flesh; for
though a majesty worthy of "the only-begotten Son of God"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430114&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
1:14) shone forth in him, yet the greater part of men did not see it, but, on
the contrary, they despised that deep abasement which was the veil or covering
of his glory.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The cause of their astonishment
was this, that he dwelt among men without any outward show; and the Jews did not
think that the Redeemer would come in that condition or attire. When he came to
be crucified, their horror was greatly increased. Paul describes this
humiliation and subsequent exaltation of Christ, when he
says,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Who, being in the form of
God, thought it not robbery to make himself equal to God, but emptied himself,
taking upon him the form of a servant, made in the likeness of man, and found in
fashion as a man, humbled himself, being made obedient even to death, and the
death of the cross. Wherefore also God hath raised him to the highest
exaltation, and hath given him a name which is above every name; that at the
name of Jesus should bow every knee of those that are in heaven and in earth and
in hell; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the
glory of God the Father."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;501706&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Philippians
2:6-11)</font><br><font face="Palatino">It was therefore necessary that Christ
should first be humbled and covered with shame, and that exaltation to which he
was about to be raised was not all at once visible; but the shame of the cross
was followed by a glorious resurrection attended by the highest
honor.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So shall he sprinkle many
nations. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Some explain it, "Shall cause to

</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hzn</font><font face="Palatino">
signifies "to sprinkle," and is commonly found to have this sense in Scripture,
I choose rather to adopt this interpretation. He means that the Lord will pour
out his Word over "many nations." He next mentions the effect of doctrine, that
<i>kings shall shut their mouth</i>, that is, in token of astonishment, but a
different kind of astonishment from that which he formerly described. Men "shut
their mouths," and are struck with bewilderment, when the vast magnitude of the
subject is such that it cannot be expressed, and that it exceeds all power of
language.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What they have not
heard. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He means that this astonishment will not
arise merely from Christ's outward appearance, but, on the contrary, from the
preaching of the Gospel; for, though he had risen from the dead, yet all would
have thought that he was still a dead man, if the glory of his resurrection had
not been proclaimed. By the preaching of the Gospel, therefore, were revealed
those things which formerly had neither been seen nor heard; for this doctrine
was conveyed to kings and nations that were very far off, and even to the very
ends of the world.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Paul quotes this passage, and
shows that it was fulfilled in his ministry, and glories on this ground, that he
proclaimed the doctrine of the Gospel to those who had never heard of it at all.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451521&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
15:21) This belongs to the office of an Apostle, and not to the office of every
minister. He means that the kingdom of Christ is more extensive than merely to
embrace Judea, and that it is not now confined within such narrow limits; for it
was proper that it should be spread through all nations, and extended even to
the ends of the world. The Jews had heard something of Christ from the Law and
the Prophets, but to the Gentiles he was altogether unknown; and hence it
follows that these words relate strictly to the
Gentiles.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall
understand. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By this word he shows that faith
consists in certainty and clear understanding. Wherever, therefore, knowledge of
this kind is wanting, faith is unquestionably wanting. Hence it is evident how
idle is the notion of the Papists about implicit faith, which is nothing else
than gross ignorance, or rather a mere creature of imagination.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino">This division, or rather dismemberment, of the
chapter, ought to be disregarded; for it ought to have begun with the thirteenth
verse of the former chapter, and these words ought to be connected with what
goes before.  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F894</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Here the Prophet pauses, as it were, in the middle of his discourse; for, having
formerly said that the name of Christ would be everywhere proclaimed, and would
be revealed to unknown nations, and yet would have so mean an aspect that it
might appear as if these things were fabulous, he breaks off his discourse, and
exclaims that "Nobody will believe those things." At the same time, he describes
his grief, that men are so unbelieving as to reject their
salvation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Thus, it is a holy complaint made by
one who wished that Christ should be known by all, and who, notwithstanding of
this, sees that there are few who believe the Gospel, and therefore groans and
cries out, "Who hath believed our report? " Let us therefore groan and complain
along with the Prophet, and let us be distressed with grief when we see that our
labor is unprofitable, and let us complain before God; for godly ministers must
be deeply affected, if they wish to perform their work faithfully. Isaiah
declares that there will be few that submit to the Gospel of Christ; for, when
he exclaims, "Who will believe the preaching?" he means that of those who hear
the Gospel scarcely a hundredth person will be a
believer.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Nor does he merely speak of himself
alone, but like one who represents all teachers. Although therefore God gives
many ministers, few will hold by their doctrine; and what then will happen when
there are no ministers? Do we wonder that the greatest blindness reigns there?
If cultivated ground is unfruitful, what shall we look for from a soil that is
uncultivated and barren? And yet it does not detract anything from the Gospel of
Christ, that there are few disciples who receive it; nor does the small number
of believers lessen its authority or obscure its infinite glory; but, on the
contrary, the loftiness of the mystery is a reason why it scarcely obtains
credit in the world. It is reckoned to be folly, because it exceeds all human
capacities.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To
whom</i></font><font face="Palatino"> (literally, <i>on whom</i>)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is the arm of Jehovah
revealed?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In this second clause he points out
the reason why the number of believers will be so small. It is, because no man
can come to God but by an extraordinary revelation of the Spirit. To suppose
that by the word "Arm" Christ is meant, is, in my opinion, a mistake. It assigns
the cause why there are so few that believe; and that is, that they cannot
attain it by the sagacity of their own understanding. This is a remarkable
passage, and is quoted by John and Paul for that purpose. "Though Jesus," said
John, "had performed many miracles in their presence, they believed not in him,
that the saying of Isaiah the Prophet might be fulfilled, which he
spake,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Lord, who hath believed
our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431237&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
12:37, 38)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And Paul says, "But they do not all believe the
Gospel; for Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report? "
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451016&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:16) Both of them declare that there will be no reason to wonder, if that
which was long ago foretold shall happen; and they do so for the purpose of
removing offense which might have arisen from the revolt of that nation, which
ought to have acknowledged Christ, but obstinately resisted
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Isaiah does not include merely the men of
his own time, but all posterity to the end of the world; for, so long as the
reign of Christ shall endure, this must be fulfilled; and therefore believers
ought to be fortified by this passage against such a scandal. These words refute
the ignorance of those who think that faith is in the power of every person,
because preaching is common to all. Though it is sufficiently evident that all
are called to salvation, yet the Prophet expressly states that the external
voice is of no avail, if it be not accompanied by a special gift of the Spirit.
And whence proceeds the difference, but from the secret election of God, the
cause of which is hidden in himself?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yet he shall grow up before
him as a twig. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This verse refers to what was
formerly said, that Christ will at first have no magnificence or outward display
among men; but that before God he will nevertheless be highly exalted, and will
be held in estimation. Hence we see that we must not judge of the glory of
Christ by human view, but must discern by faith what is taught us concerning him
by the Holy Scriptures; and therefore the phrase "before him," is here
contrasted with human senses, which cannot comprehend that lofty greatness.
Almost the same metaphor was used by the Prophet,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;231101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
11:1) when he said, "A branch shall spring out of the stock of Jesse;" for the
house of David was like a dry stock, in which no rigor and no comeliness was
visible, and on that account is there called not a royal house, but "Jesse," a
name which bore no celebrity. Only the Prophet adds here,
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In a desert
land</i></font><font face="Palatino">; by which he means that Christ's power of
springing up will not be derived from the sap of the earth, as in trees, but
contrary to the ordinary course of nature. They who in this passage speculate
about the virgin Mary, and suppose that she is called a desert land, because she
conceived by the Holy Ghost, and not by ordinary generation, speak beside the
purpose; for the present subject is not the birth of Christ, but his whole
reign. He says that it will resemble a twig springing out of a dry soil, which
looks as if it could never become large. If we take into account the whole
method of establishing his kingdom, and the agency which he employed, and how
feeble were its beginnings, and how many foes it encountered, we shall easily
understand that all these things were fulfilled as they had been foretold. What
sort of men were the Apostles that they should subdue so many kings and nations
by the sword of the word? Are they not justly compared to offshoots? Thus the
Prophet shows by what means the kingdom of Christ must be set up and
established, that we may not judge of it by human
conceptions.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He hath no form
nor comeliness. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This must be understood to
relate not merely to the person of Christ, who was despised by the world, and
was at length condemned to a disgraceful death; but to his whole kingdom, which
in the eyes of men had no beauty, no comeliness, no splendor, which, in short,
had nothing that could direct or captivate the hearts of men to it by its
outward show. Although Christ arose from the dead, yet the Jews always regarded
him as a person who had been crucified and disgraced, in consequence of which
they haughtily disdained him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Despised and rejected.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">This verse conveys the same statement as the
preceding, namely, that Christ will be "rejected" by men, in consequence of
their beholding in him nothing but grief and infirmity. These things needed to
be often repeated to the Jews, that they might not form a false conception of
Christ and his kingdom; for, in order to know his glory, we must proceed from
his death to his resurrection. Many stumble at his death, as if he had been
vanquished and overwhelmed by it; but we ought to contemplate his power and
majesty in the resurrection; and if any one choose to begin with the
resurrection, he will not follow the order laid down by the Prophet, nor
comprehend the Lord's strength and
power.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We hid the face from
him. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Not without reason does he use the first
person, <i>we;</i> for he declares that there will be a universal judgment; and
no man will ever be able to comprehend it by his own understanding till the Lord
correct and form him anew by his Spirit. Although he appears chiefly to censure
the Jews, who ought not to have so haughtily rejected the Son of God promised
and offered to them, and therefore reckons himself as one of the number, because
he was an individual belonging to that nation; yet let us learn from this
passage that all men are accursed and condemned for ingratitude in despising
Christ, because they do not even consider him to be worthy of being looked at,
but turn away their eyes as if from something
detestable.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Surely he carried our
sicknesses. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;ka</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>aken</i>) is not only a strong affirmation, but is likewise equivalent to
<i>for, </i>and assigns a reason of something which went before, and which might
have been thought new and strange; for it is a monstrous thing that he to whom
God has given supreme authority over all the creatures should be thus trampled
on and scorned; and if the reason were not assigned, it would have been
universally pronounced to be ridiculous. The reason, therefore, of the weakness,
pains, and shame of Christ is, that "he carried our
sicknesses."</font><br><font face="Palatino">Matthew quotes this prediction,
after having related that Christ cured various diseases; though it is certain
that he was appointed not to cure bodies, but rather to cure souls; for it is of
spiritual disease that the Prophet intends to speak. But in the miracles which
Christ performed in curing bodies, he gave a proof of the salvation which he
brings to our souls. That healing had therefore a more extensive reference than
to bodies, because he was appointed to be the physician of souls; and
accordingly Matthew applies to the outward sign what belonged to the truth and
reality.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We thought him to be
smitten, wounded by God, and afflicted. </i></font><font face="Palatino">In this
second clause he shows how great was the ingratitude and wickedness of the
people, who did not know why Christ was so severely afflicted, but imagined that
God smote him on account of his own sins, though they knew that he was perfectly
innocent, and his innocence was attested even by his judge.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402724&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
27:24;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;422304&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
23:4, 14, 22;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431838&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
18:38) Since therefore they know that an innocent man is punished for sins which
he did not commit, why do they not think that it indicated some extraordinary
excellence to exist in him? But because they see him wounded and despised, they
do not inquire about the cause, and from the event alone, as fools are wont to
do, they pronounce judgment. Accordingly, Isaiah complains of the wicked
judgment of men, in not considering the cause of Christ's heavy afflictions; and
especially he deplores the dullness of his own nation, because they thought that
God was a deadly enemy of Christ, and took no account of their own sins, which
were to be expiated in this manner.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he was wounded for our
iniquities. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He again repeats the cause of
Christ's great afflictions, in order to meet the scandal which might have arisen
from it. The spectacle of the cross alienates many persons from Christ, when
they consider what is presented to their eyes, and do not observe the object to
be accomplished. But all offense is removed when we know that by his death our
sins have been expiated, and salvation has been obtained for
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The chastisement of our
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some think that this is called "the
chastisement of peace," on account of men being careless and stupefied amidst
their afflictions, and therefore that it was necessary that Christ should
suffer. Others view "peace" as relating to the consciences, that is, that Christ
suffered, in order that we might have peaceful consciences; as Paul says that,
"being justified by faith through Christ, we have peace with God."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
5:1) But I take it to denote simply reconciliation. Christ was the price of "our
chastisement," that is, of the chastisement which was due to us. Thus the wrath
of God, which had been justly kindled against us, was appeased; and through the
Mediator we have obtained "peace," by which we are
reconciled.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We ought to draw from this a
universal doctrine, namely, that we are reconciled to God by free grace, because
Christ hath paid the price of "our peace." This is indeed acknowledged by the
Papists; but then they limit this doctrine to original sin, as if after baptism
there were no longer any room for reconciliation through free grace, but that we
must give satisfaction by our merits and works. But the Prophet does not here
treat of a single species of pardon, but extends this blessing to the whole
course of life; and therefore it cannot be thus undervalued or limited to a
particular time, without most heinous sacrilege. Hence also the frivolous
distinction of the Papists, between the remission of punishment and the pardon
of sin, is easily refuted. They affirm that punishment is not remitted to us,
unless it be washed out by satisfactions. But the Prophet openly declares that
the punishment of our sins was transferred to him. What, then, do the Papists
intend but to be Christ's equals and companions, and to lay claim to share with
him in his authority?</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In his
wound </i></font><font face="Palatino">(or, <i>in his medicine)
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>we have healing.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He again directs us to Christ, that we may
betake ourselves to his wounds, provided that we wish to regain life. Here the
Prophet draws a contrast between us and Christ; for in us nothing call be found
but destruction and death; in Christ alone is life and salvation, he alone
brought medicine to us, and even procures health by his weakness, and life by
his death; for he alone hath pacified the Father, he alone hath reconciled us to
him. Here we might bring forward many things about the blessed consequences of
Christ's sufferings, if we had not determined to expound rather than to preach;
and therefore let us be satisfied with a plain exposition. Let every one,
therefore, draw consolation from this passage, and let him apply the blessed
result of this doctrine to his own use; for these words are spoken to all in
general, and to individuals in particular.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We all, like sheep, have gone
astray. </i></font><font face="Palatino">In order to impress more deeply on our
hearts the benefit of the death of Christ, he shows how necessary is that
healing which he formerly mentioned. If we do not perceive our wretchedness and
poverty, we shall never know how desirable is that remedy which Christ has
brought to us, or approach him with due ardor of affection. As soon as we know
that we are ruined, then, aware of our wretchedness, we eagerly run to avail
ourselves of the remedy, which otherwise would be held by us in no estimation.
In order, therefore, that Christ may be appreciated by us, let every one
consider and examine himself, so as to acknowledge that he is ruined till he is
redeemed by Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We see that here none are
excepted, for the Prophet includes "all." The whole human race would have
perished, if Christ had not brought relief. He does not even except the Jews,
whose hearts were puffed up with a false opinion of their own superiority, but
condemns them indiscriminately, along with others, to destruction. By comparing
them to sheep, he intends not to extenuate their guilt, as if little blame
attached to them, but to state plainly that it belongs to Christ to gather from
their wanderings those who resembled brute
beasts.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every one hath turned
to his own way. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By adding the term <i>every
one</i>, he descends from a universal statement, in which he included all, to a
special statement, that every individual may consider in his own mind if it be
so; for a general statement produces less effect upon us than to know that it
belongs to each of us in particular. Let "every one," therefore, arouse his
conscience, and present himself before the judgment-seat of God, that he may
confess his wretchedness. Moreover, what is the nature of this "going astray"
the Prophet states more plainly. It is, that every one hath followed the way
which he had chosen for himself, that is, hath determined to live according to
his own fancy; by which he means that there is only one way of living uprightly,
and if any one "turn aside" from it, he can experience nothing but "going
astray."</font><br><font face="Palatino">He does not speak of works only, but of
nature itself, which always leads us astray; for, if we could by natural
instinct or by our own wisdom, bring ourselves back into the path, or guard
ourselves against going astray, Christ would not be needed by us. Thus, in
ourselves we all are undone unless Christ
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430836&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
8:36) sets us free; and the more we rely on our wisdom or industry, the more
dreadfully and the more speedily do we draw down destruction on ourselves. And
so the Prophet shows what we are before we are regenerated by Christ; for all
are involved in the same condemnation. "There is none righteous, none that
understandeth, none that seeketh God. All have turned aside, and have become
unprofitable. There is none that doeth good; no, not one."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
14:3) All this is more fully explained by Paul.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:10)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jehovah hath laid
upon him. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Here we have a beautiful contrast. In
ourselves we are scattered; in Christ we are gathered together. By nature we go
astray, and are driven headlong to destruction; in Christ we find the course by
which we are conducted to the harbor of salvation. Our sins are a heavy load;
but they are laid on Christ, by whom we are freed from the load. Thus, when we
were ruined, and, being estranged from God, were hastening to hell, Christ took
upon him the filthiness of our iniquities, in order to rescue us from
everlasting destruction. This must refer exclusively to guilt and punishment;
for he was free from sin.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
4:15;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600222&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1

that he may have a true relish of that grace, and may obtain the benefit of the
death of Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He was punished.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet applauds the obedience of
Christ in suffering death; for if his death had not been voluntary, he would not
have been regarded as having satisfied for our disobedience. "As by one man's
disobedience," says Paul, "all became sinners, so by one man's obedience many
were made righteous.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450519&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
5:19) And elsewhere, "He became obedient unto death, even the death of the
cross."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;502308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
2:8) This was the reason of his silence at the judgment-seat of Pilate, though
he had a just defense to offer; for, having become answerable for our guilt, he
wished to submit silently to the sentence, that we might loudly glory in the
righteousness of faith obtained through free
grace.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As a lamb shall he be
led to the slaughter. </i></font><font face="Palatino">We are here exhorted to
patience and meekness, that, following the example of Christ, we may be ready to
endure reproaches and cruel assaults, distress and torture. In this sense Peter
quotes this passage, showing that we ought to become like Christ our Head, that
we may imitate his patience and submissiveness.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600223&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 2:23) In the word <i>lamb </i>there is probably an allusion to the
sacrifices under the Law; and in this sense he is elsewhere called "the Lamb of
God."

1:29, 36)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From prison and judgment.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">There are various ways in which this passage is
expounded. Some think that the Prophet continues the argument which he had
already begun to treat, namely, that Christ was smitten by the hand of God, and
afflicted, on account of our sins. The Greek translators render it,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn th~| tapeinw&gt;sei aujtou~ hJ
kri&gt;siv aujtou~ h]|rqh</font><font face="Palatino">. "In his humiliation his
judgment was taken away." Others, "He was taken away without delay." Others
explain it, "He was taken away to the cross; " that is, as soon as Christ was
seized, he was dragged to "judgment." I rather agree with those who think that
the Prophet, after having spoken of death, passes to the glory of the
resurrection. He intended to meet the thoughts by which the minds of many
persons might have been troubled and distressed; for when we see nothing but
wounds and shame, we are struck with amazement, because human nature shrinks
from such a spectacle.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet therefore
declares that he was <i>taken away;</i> that is, that he was rescued "from
prison and judgment" or condemnation, and afterwards was exalted to the highest
rank of honor; that no one might think that he was overwhelmed or swallowed up
by that terrible and shameful kind of death. For, undoubtedly, he was victorious
even in the midst of death, and triumphed over his enemies; and he was so judged
that now he has been appointed to be judge of all, as was publicly manifested by
his resurrection.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;441042&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
10:42) The same order is followed by the Prophet as by Paul, who, after having
declared that Christ was abased even to the cross, adds that, on this account,
he was exalted to the very highest honor, and that there was given him a: name
to which all things both in heaven and in earth must render obedience and bend

generation? </i></font><font face="Palatino">This exclamation has been stretched
and (I may say) tortured into various meanings. The ancients abused this passage
in reasoning against the Arians, when they wished to prove by it Christ's
eternal generation. But they ought to have been satisfied with clearer
testimonies of Scripture, that they might not expose themselves to the mockery
of heretics, who sometimes take occasion from this to become more obstinate; for
it might easily have been objected that the Prophet was not thinking about that
subject. Chrysostom views it as relating to the human nature of Christ, that he
was miraculously, and not by ordinary generation, conceived in the womb of the
virgin; but that is a wide departure from the Prophet's meaning. Others think
that Isaiah kindles into rage against the men of that age who crucified Christ.
Others refer it to the posterity which should be born; namely, that Christ's
posterity will be numerous though he die.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But,
as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwd</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>(dor)</i> signifies "age" or "duration," I have no doubt that he speaks of
the "age" of Christ, and that his meaning is, that Christ, though almost
overwhelmed by sicknesses, shall not only be taken from them, but that even his
age shall be permanent and eternal; or, in other words, that he shall be unlike
those who are indeed rescued from death, but shall afterwards die; for Christ
rose from the dead, to live for ever, and, as Paul says, "cannot now die; death
shall no longer have dominion over him."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:9) Yet let us remember that the Prophet does not speak of Christ's person
alone, but includes the whole body of the Church, which ought never to be
separated from him. We have therefore a striking proof of the perpetuity of the
Church. As Christ liveth for ever, so he will not permit his kingdom to perish.
The same immortality shall at length be bestowed on each of the
members.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For he was cut off.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">This might indeed, at first sight, appear to be
absurd, that the death of Christ is the cause and source of our life; but,
because he bore the punishment of our sins, we ought therefore to apply to
ourselves all the shame that appears in the cross. Yet in Christ the wonderful
love of God shines forth, which renders his glory visible to us; so that we
ought to be excited to rapturous
admiration.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the
transgression of my people. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He again repeats
that the wound was inflicted on him "for the sins of the people; " and the
object is, that we may diligently consider that it was for our sake, and not for
his own, that he suffered; for he bore the punishment which we must have
endured, if he had not offered this atonement. We ought to perceive in ourselves
that guilt of which he bore the accusation and punishment, having offered
himself in our name to the Father,

wicked men for burial;" as if the Prophet spake of the punishment by which the
Lord took vengeance for the sin of wicked men, who crucified Christ. But he
rather speaks of the death of Christ, and of the fruit of it, and says nothing
about that revenge. Others think that the particle

By "rich men" he means "violent men;" for men grow haughty and disdainful on
account of their riches, and abuse their wealth to savage cruelty. And thus by
the terms "wicked men" and "rich men" the same thing, in my opinion, is denoted.
He means, therefore, that Christ was exposed to the reproaches, and insolence,
and lawless passions of wicked men. For, on the one hand, the Pharisees and
priests
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402666&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
26:66) rush upon him with unbridled rage and foul slander; on the other hand,
Pilate, though well aware of his innocence,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;411514&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark

might be said to have overwhelmed him. If it be objected that Christ had an
honorable burial, I reply, that burial was the commencement of a glorious
resurrection; but at present the Prophet speaks of death, which is often denoted
by "the grave." I consider this, therefore, to be the real meaning, though I
wish to leave every person free to form his own
opinion.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Though he did no

Here the Prophet applauds the innocence of Christ, not only in order to defend
him from slander, but to speak highly of the benefit of his death, that we may
not think that he suffered by chance. Though innocent, he suffered by the decree
of God; and therefore it was for our sake, and not for his own, that he
suffered. He bore the punishment which was due to
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Neither was there deceit
in his mouth. </i></font><font face="Palatino">In two words he describes the
perfect innocence of Christ; namely, that he never offended either in deed or in
word. That this cannot be said of any mortal man is universally acknowledged,
and hence it follows that it applies to Christ
alone.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.

formerly stated in few words, that the Prophet, in asserting Christ's innocence,
aims at something more than to defend him from all reproach. The object
therefore is, that we should consider the cause, in order to have experience of
the effect; for God appoints nothing at random, and hence it follows that the
cause of his death is lawful. We must also keep in view the contrast. In Christ
there was no fault; why, then, was the Lord pleased that he should suffer?
Because he stood in our room, and in no other way than by his death could the
justice of God be
satisfied.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When he shall have

The sacrifice was offered in such a manner as to expiate sin by enduring its
punishment and curse. This was expressed by the priests by means of the laying
on of hands, as if they threw on the sacrifice the sins of the whole nation.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;022915&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus

such a manner that he alone bore the curse.</font><br><font face="Palatino">On
this account Paul also calls him a "curse" or "execration:" "Christ hath

an expiatory sacrifice.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here we have a
description of the benefit of Christ's death, that by his sacrifice sins were
expiated, and God was reconciled towards men; for such is the import of this
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>(asham.) </i>Hence it follows that nowhere but in Christ is found expiation
and satisfaction for sin. In order to understand this better, we must first know
that we are guilty before God, so that we may be accursed and detestable in his
presence. Now, if we wish to return to a state of favor with him, sin must be
taken away. This cannot be accomplished by sacrifices contrived according to the
fancy of men. Consequently, we must come to the death of Christ; for in no other
way can satisfaction be given to God. In short, Isaiah teaches that sins cannot
be pardoned in any other way than by betaking ourselves to the death of Christ.
If any person think that this language is harsh and disrespectful to Christ, let
him descend into himself, and, after a close examination, let him ponder how
dreadful is the judgment of God, which could not be pacified but by this price;
and thus the inestimable grace which shines forth in making Christ accursed will
easily remove every ground of
offense.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He shall see his
seed. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Isaiah means that the death of Christ not
only can be no hinderance to his having a seed, but will be the cause of his
having offspring; that is, because, by quickening the dead, he will procure a
people for himself, whom he will afterwards multiply more and more; and there is
no absurdity in giving the appellation of Christ's seed to all believers, who
are also brethren, because they are descended from
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He shall prolong his

<i>(asher,)</i> "which:" "A seed which shall be long lived." But I expound it in
a more simple manner, "Christ shall not be hindered by his death from prolonging
his days, that is, from living eternally." Some persons, when departing from
life, leave children, but children who shall survive them, and who shall live so
as to obtain a name only when their fathers are dead. But Christ shall ell joy
the society of his children; for he shall not die like other men, but shall
obtain eternal life in himself and his children. Thus Isaiah declares that in
the head and the members there shall be immortal
life.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the will of Jehovah
shall prosper in his hand. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The word "hand"
often denotes "ministry," as the Lord proclaimed the law "by the hand of Moses."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;043613&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
36:13) Again, the Lord did this "by the hands of David; " that is, he made use

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;150310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezra
3:10) So also "in the hand of Christ shall prosper the will of God;" that is,
the Lord will cause the ministry of Christ to yield its fruit, that it may not
be thought that he exposed himself fruitlessly to such terrible
sufferings.</font><br><font face="Palatino">These few words contain a very rich
doctrine, which every reader may draw from them; but we are satisfied with
giving a simple exposition of the text. "Will" is taken in the same acceptation
as before; for he makes use of the word

<i>(chaphetz)</i> by which he means a kind and generous disposition. Two views
of God's kindness are held up for our admiration in this passage; first, that he
spared not his only-begotten Son, but delivered him for us, that he might
deliver us from death; and secondly, that he does not suffer his death to be
useless and unprofitable, but causes it to yield very abundant, fruit; for the
death of Christ would be of no avail to us, if we did not experience its fruit
and efficacy.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From the labor of his soul he
shall see. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Isaiah continues the same subject.
He declares that Christ, after having suffered, shall obtain the fruit of his
death in the salvation of men. When he says, "He shall see," we must supply the
words, "Fruit and Efficacy." This is full of the sweetest consolation; for
Isaiah could not have better expressed the infinite love of Christ toward us
than by declaring that he takes the highest delight in our salvation, and that
he rests in it as the fruit of his labors, as he who has obtained his wish rests
in that which he most ardently desired; for no person can be said to be
satisfied but he who has obtained what he wished so earnestly as to disregard
everything else and be satisfied with this
alone.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By his doctrine, or by
the knowledge of him. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He now points out the way
and method by which we experience the power and efficacy of the death of Christ,
and obtain the benefit of it. That method is "the knowledge of him." I
acknowledge that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">t[d</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>(dagnath)</i> may be taken either in an active or a passive sense, as
denoting either "the knowledge of him" or "his knowledge." In whichsoever of
these senses it is taken, we shall easily understand the Prophet's meaning; and
the Jews will not be able to practice such impudent sophistry as to prevent us
from extorting from them a reluctant acknowledgment of what is here asserted,
that Christ. is the only teacher and author of
righteousness.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall justify
many. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By the word "justify" he points out the
effect of this teaching. Thus, men are not only taught righteousness in the
school of Christ, but are actually justified. And this is the difference between
the righteousness of faith and the righteousness of the Law; for although the
Law shows what it is to be righteous, yet Paul affirms that it is impossible
that righteousness should be obtained by it, and experience proves the same
thing; for the Law is a mirror in which we behold our own unrighteousness.
(Romans 3: 20;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
2:16, 21, and 3:10, 11) Now, the doctrine which Christ teaches, as to obtaining
righteousness, is nothing else than "the knowledge of him;" and this is faith,
when we embrace the benefit of his death and fully rely on
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Philosophers have laid down many excellent
precepts, which, as they imagine, contain righteousness; but they never could
bestow it on any man;  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F901</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for who ever obtained by their rules the power of living uprightly? And it is of
no advantage to know what is true righteousness, if we are destitute of it. To
say nothing about philosophers, the Law itself, which contains the most perfect
rule of life, could not (as we have said) bestow this; not that there was any
defect in it, for Moses testified
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;053019&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
30:19) that "he had set before them good and evil, life and death;" but that the
corruption of our nature is such that the Law could not suffice for procuring
righteousness. In like manner Paul teaches
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450803&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:3) that this weakness proceeds "from our flesh," and not from the Law; for
nature prompts us in another direction, and our lusts burst forth with greater
violence, like wild and furious beasts, against the command of God. The
consequence is, that "the law worketh wrath," instead of righteousness.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
4:15) The law therefore holds all men as convicted, and, after having made known
their sin, renders men utterly inexcusable.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We
must therefore seek another way of righteousness, namely, in Christ, whom the
law also pointed out as its end.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451003&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:3.) "The righteousness of the law was of this nature: He who doeth these
things shall live by them."

18:5;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:12.) But nobody has done them, and therefore another righteousness is
necessary, which Paul also proves
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451008&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:8) by a quotation from Moses himself, "The word is nigh, in thy mouth and in
thy heart; that is, the word of faith which we preach."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;053014&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
30:14) By this doctrine, therefore, we are justified; not by the bare and simple
doctrine, but inasmuch as it exhibits the benefit of the death of Christ, by
which atonement is made for our sins, and we are reconciled to God.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450510&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
5:10.) For, if we embrace this benefit by faith, we are reckoned righteous
before God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For he shall bear
their iniquities. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet explains his
meaning by pointing out what this doctrine contains; for these two clauses agree
well: "he shall justify by his doctrine," or "by the knowledge of him," inasmuch
as "he shall bear their iniquities." Having been once made a sacrifice for us,
he now invites us by the doctrine of the Gospel, to receive the fruit of his
death; and thus the death of Christ is the substance of the doctrine, in order
that he may justify us. To this saying of the Prophet Paul fully subscribes;
for, after having taught that "Christ was an expiatory sacrifice for us, that we
might be made the righteousness of God in him," he at the same time adds, "We
are ambassadors for Christ, and beseech you, be ye reconciled to God."

justifies us, not only as he is God, but also as he is man; for in our flesh he
procured righteousness for us. He does not say, "The Son," but "My servant,"
that we may not only view him as God, but may contemplate his human nature, in
which he performed that obedience by which we are acquitted before God. The
foundation of our salvation is this, that he offered himself as a sacrifice;
and, in like manner, he himself declares,</font><br></div>

doctrine as to the victory which Christ obtained by his death; for what was
formerly stated, that by his death we are reconciled to the Father, would not
have sufficiently confirmed our hearts. Here he borrows a comparison from the
ordinary form of a triumphal procession held by those who, after having obtained
a signal victory, are commonly received and adorned with great pomp and
splendor. Thus also Christ, as a valiant and illustrious general, triumphed over
the enemies whom he had
vanquished.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he shall

torture, in my opinion, the Prophet's meaning. In these two clauses there is
only this difference, that in the former God testifies what he gave to Christ,

his own account, but on ours;

for the fruit of this victory comes to us. For us Christ subdued death, the
world, and the devil. In a word, the Prophet here applauds the victory which
followed the death of Christ; for "although he was crucified through the
weakness of the flesh, yet by the power of the Spirit" he rose from the dead,
and triumphed over his enemies.

15:28) But the Prophet spoke in general terms, in order to show that Christ did
not die an ordinary death. For the purpose of disgracing him the more, those two
robbers were added; that Christ, as the most wicked of all, might be placed in
the midst of them. This passage is, therefore, most appropriately quoted by Mark
as relating to that
circumstance.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He bore the sin
of many. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This is added by way of correction,
that, when we hear of the shame of Christ's death, we may not think that it was
a blot on the character of Christ, and that our minds may not, by being
prejudiced in that manner, be prevented from receiving the victory which he
obtained for us, that is, the fruit of his death. He shows, therefore, that this
was done in order that he might take our sins upon him; and his object is, that,
whenever the death of Christ shall be mentioned, we may at the same time
remember the atonement made for us. And this fruit swallows up all the shame of
the death of Christ, that his majesty and glory may be more clearly seen than if
we only beheld him sitting in heaven; for we have in him a striking and
memorable proof of the love of God, when he is so insulted, degraded, and loaded
with the utmost disgrace, in order that we, on whom had been pronounced a
sentence of everlasting destruction, may enjoy along with him immortal
glory.</font><br><font face="Palatino">I have followed the ordinary
interpretation, that "he bore the sin of many," though we might without
impropriety consider the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ybr</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>(rabbim,)</i> to denote "Great and Noble." And thus the contrast would be
more complete, that Christ, while "he was ranked among transgressors," became
surety for every one of the most excellent of the earth, and suffered in the
room of those who hold the highest rank in the world. I leave this to the
judgment of my readers. Yet I approve of the ordinary reading, that he alone
bore the punishment of many, because on him was laid the guilt of the whole
world. It is evident from other passages, and especially from the fifth chapter
of the Epistle to the Romans, that "many" sometimes denotes
"all."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And prayed for the
transgressors. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Because the ratification of the
atonement, with which Christ has washed us by his death, implies that he pleaded
with the Father on our behalf, it was proper that this should be added. For, as
in the ancient Law the priest, who "never entered without blood," at the same
time interceded for the people; so what was there shadowed out is fulfilled in
Christ.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;023010&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
30:10;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580907&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
9:7) First, he offered the sacrifice of his body, and shed his blood, that he
might endure the punishment which was due to us; and secondly, in order that the
atonement might take effect, he performed the office of an advocate, and
interceded for all who embraced this sacrifice by faith; as is evident from that
prayer which he left to us, written by the hand of John, "I pray not for these
only, but for all who shall believe on me through their word."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431720&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
17:20) If we then belong to their number, let us be fully persuaded that Christ
hath suffered for us, that we may now enjoy the benefit of his
death.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He expressly mentions "transgressors,"
that we may know that we ought to betake ourselves with assured confidence to
the cross of Christ, when we are horror-struck by the dread of sin. Yea, for
this reason he is held out as our intercessor and advocate; for without his
intercession our sins would deter us from approaching to God.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shout.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">After having spoken of the death of Christ, he
passes on with good reason to the Church; that we may feel mere deeply in
ourselves what is the value and efficacy of his death. We cannot behold it in
Christ, if he be viewed by himself; and therefore we must come to his body,
which is the Church; because Christ suffered for the Church, and not for
himself. And this is the order in our Confession of Faith  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F904</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for, after having professed that we believe in Christ, who suffered and was
crucified for us, we add that we believe in the Church,  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F905</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which flowed, as it were, from his side. Accordingly, after having discoursed
concerning the death and resurrection and triumph of Christ, he properly comes
down to the Church, which ought never to be separated from her Head, that each
individual believer may learn by his own experience that Christ has not suffered
in vain. And if he had not mentioned this doctrine, believers could not have so
well strengthened their hearts by the hope of restoring the Church. This
congratulation plainly shows that, when Christ shall come forth as a conqueror
over death, he will not merely conquer for himself as an individual, but will,
at the same time, breathe life into his
body.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou barren, that didst
not bear. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He calls the Church "barren," because
no offspring could be expected from her, so long as she groaned under wretched
bondage; for if any one had judged of her from her outward condition, he would
have concluded that she was very near destruction. And even apart from her
external wretchedness, there was nothing pure within; everything was corrupted
and defiled by superstitions; for they had degenerated into the idolatrous rites
of the Gentiles.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The children
of the widow. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He calls the Church not merely
"Barren," but a "Widow," though either of them might have taken away the hope of
having offspring; but when these two are combined, what else can be looked for
than wretched destruction? But against such accumulated distress he bids her be
of good courage, because she shall have more children than the married
woman.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This passage may be explained in two
ways; either as a comparison of the Church with the Gentiles, who flourished
like "a married woman," or as a comparison with that condition in which the
Church was before the captivity. Both senses will be perfectly admissible, but I
prefer to adopt the more simple view; for I do not think that it is a comparison
between two conditions of the Church, but that it is an ordinary form of
expression which the Prophet employs in order to denote that this extraordinary
fertility of the Church will be at variance with what usually takes place, so
that men may not judge of her condition by the ordinary course of nature;
because the work of God will be extraordinary and wonderful. And yet I
acknowledge that she was at that time in widowhood; for God had long before sent
to her by his servants a bill of divorcement, and had actually divorced that
nation, by driving it into banishment. But the Prophet declares that this
punishment will be temporary, as we shall immediately see more
clearly.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Widen the place of thy
tabernacles. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He continues his argument under
other metaphors, and promises that the Lord will not only restore his Church,
but will bestow upon her a condition far more excellent. They who think that the
Church is compared in this passage to a synagogue are, in my opinion, mistaken,
and only succeed in increasing the obstinacy of the Jews, who perceive that the
Prophet's meaning is tortured. I do indeed acknowledge that these things relate
to the kingdom of Christ, and that they were at length fulfilled as soon as the
Gospel began to be preached; but it does not therefore follow that the Prophet
did not, at the same time, keep his eye upon that period which preceded the
coming of Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This prophecy began to be
fulfilled under Cyrus, who gave the people liberty to return, and afterwards
extended to Christ, in whom it has its full accomplishment. The Church therefore
conceived, when the people returned to their native country; for the body of the
people was gathered together from which Christ should proceed, in order that the
pure worship of God and true religion might again be revived. Hitherto, indeed,
this fertility was not visible; for the conception was concealed, as it were, in
the mother's womb, and no outward appearance of it could be seen; but afterwards
the people were increased, and after the birth the Church grew from infancy to
manhood, till the Gospel was preached. This was the actual youth of the Church;
and next follows the age of manhood, down to Christ's last coming, when all
things shall be fully accomplished.</font><br><font face="Palatino">All these
things must be taken together, if we wish to learn the Prophet's real meaning.
In this way Zechariah 2:5 Malachi 4: 2 and Haggai encouraged the people by the
hope of their future condition, when they saw that little progress was made in
building the temple; for they promised that "the glory of the latter temple
should be greater than the glory of the former."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;370209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Haggai
2:9) This was not at all visible, and therefore they extended those promises
till Christ; and by hope and confidence in him the people must have been
encouraged to build the temple. Consequently, this consolation was common to the
Jews who lived under the Law, and to us who see more clearly in Christ this
restoration of the Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
curtains of thy tents. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The metaphor is borrowed
from tabernacles, which were extensively used in that country. The Church is
compared to them, because it has no solid building in the world; for it appears
to be wandering and unsettled, in consequence of being necessarily moved from
one place to another on account of various changes. But still I am fully
persuaded that the Prophet had in his eye that former deliverance (as we have
stated to have been customary with the prophets) when, being led through the
wilderness, they dwelt in tents for forty years; for which reason they kept a
public festival every year by the command of God.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;032339&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
23:39-43)</font><br><font face="Palatino">It will be objected that the building
which is erected by the ministers of the Word is so solid that it ought not to
be compared to "tabernacles." But I reply, this metaphor of "tabernacles"
relates rather to the outward aspect of the Church than to its spiritual and
(what, may be called) its internal condition; for the actual building of the
Church is nothing else than the kingdom of God, which is not fading or similar
to tents. Yet the Church does not cease to be conveyed from one place to
another; for it has no stable or permanent habitation. In short, its solid
firmness is such that it surpasses the best fortified citadels; for, relying on
the invincible power of God, it scorns all danger. On the other hand, it
resembles "tents," because earthly wealth, forces, and strength are not its
support.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because thou shalt be
multiplied. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Now follows the reason why he
commanded the cords to be lengthened for enlarging the tents. It is, that a
moderate space would not contain a numerous people, whom the Lord will gather
into one from every quarter. Now, because Judea was hideous on account of its
ruins and desolation, he says that the forsaken cities shall be
inhabited.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fear not, for thou shalt not
be ashamed. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Here, as formerly, he strengthens
the hearts of believers, and addresses the whole Church; for the calamity was
universal, and the Church appeared to be totally ruined. He bids her be of good
cheer, and next assigns the reason; that the issue of her troubles will be such
that she "shall not be ashamed;" as if he had said, "Although for a time thou
art wretched, yet thy affairs shall be prosperous;" and as it is elsewhere said,
"They who hope in the Lord shall not be ashamed."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;192503&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
25:3)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Blush not;
</i></font><font face="Palatino">that is, "cherish good hope, and be confident."
Those men "blush" who are ashamed, and who, being disappointed of their hope,
suffer their hearts to be cast down. he next assigns the same reason, "for thou
shalt not be exposed to shame." I consider that here, as formerly,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yk</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>(ki)</i> signifies <i>for; </i>and therefore the same sentence is twice
repeated under a variety of expressions, except that the former clause may
relate to the disposition of the heart, and the latter to the external cause.
But the more simple meaning of both clauses is, that it is a promise of success
and prosperity, as if he had said that the calamity shall be brought to an
end.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yea, thou shalt forget
the shame of thy youth. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This is a confirmation
of the former clause. He means the calamities which befell the Church while she
was still young, and the remembrance of which will be wholly obliterated by the
prosperity which she shall afterwards enjoy. We mentioned a little before, that
<i>widowhood </i>is a term used in regard to her, because God had forsaken, and,
so to speak, had divorced her.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thy Maker is thy husband.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He assigns the reason why she will forget all
the distresses and calamities which she formerly endured. It is because God will
again receive her into favor; for captivity might be said to be a kind of
divorce, as we formerly saw.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:1) He now says, "He who created thee shall be thy husband;" for such is the
import of the words. He calls himself the "Maker" of his Church, not only
because he created the Church as he created other men, but because he
condescended to adopt her as his heritage; and this privilege may be regarded as
a new life. Although the Jews fell from their dignity, as men are speedily led
to revolt,  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F906</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
if they are not renewed by the Spirit of strength, yet their spiritual creation
was not wholly extinguished, for the remembrance of the covenant remained, and
hence also God created them
anew.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whose name is Jehovah of
hosts. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This refers to his power, that we may be
permitted to glory in it., seeing that we are his children; for the greater the
power of God, and the more honorable his name, so much the greater is our
boasting, so long as we are his children and do not boast of an empty title.
Now, the Prophet magnifies this kindness of God, that he condescends to have us
instead of a wife, that we may be able to glory in his power and
strength.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy Redeemer.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He calls himself the "Redeemer," in order that
he may more fully confirm the people in that hope; that, although the former
deliverance appeared to be cancelled, because the people were again led into
captivity, yet they shall be restored in such a manner as to know that the grace
of God is not without
effect.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall be called.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">The verb,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">arqy</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>(yikkare)</i> "shall be called," may refer either to the name "Redeemer," or
to the name "Holy One," or to both I willingly connect both together in this
manner, "The Holy One of Israel shall be called thy Redeemer, and the God of the
whole earth."  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F907</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He employs the expression, the whole earth, because the name of God had formerly
been, in some respects, confined to Judea, but, by the preaching of the Gospel,
the Gentiles have been called to the same hope of salvation.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
76:2) The Lord is "the God of the Gentiles"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450329&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:29) as well as "of the Jews; " for the Gentiles, though formerly "far off,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For as a woman forsaken.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He meets a doubt which might arise in the minds
of believers amidst so distressing a calamity. It seemed as if the Lord had
rejected them, so that they had nothing to look for but destruction. The Prophet
therefore reminds them that they ought not to despair, because they have been
thus forsaken; for God, according to his mercy, is ready to be reconciled, and
is even willing to raise them from the dead.  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F908</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
a wife of youth. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He employs this expression in
order that, by this metaphor, he may more fully confirm their hearts in that
hope; for the hearts of young husbands are more easily reconciled than the
hearts of older husbands, being attracted, and, as it were, driven forward by
youthful age and tender love. In like manner, he shows that God will be easily
reconciled. "True, thou wast divorced; but the divorce shall not be of long
duration. The Lord will show himself ready to be reconciled, and will even, of
his own accord, be the first to invite thee to reconciliation."  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F909</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For a little moment I forsook
thee. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet explains more fully the
former statement, and shows what will be the nature of this divorce, namely,
that she shall be speedily restored to her former condition. He magnifies the
mercy of God, and extenuates the sorrow by which the hearts of believers might
be oppressed. It was not enough for believers to expect some revival, if they
were not convinced that God's wrath would be of short duration. We quickly lose
courage and faint, if the Lord be not nigh, and if he do not quickly stretch out
his hand to us. For this reason Isaiah, after having spoken of restoring the
Church, adds that this divorce shall last but "for a moment," but that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his mercy shall be
everlasting</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino">When
he says that he <i>forsook </i>his people, it is a sort of admission of the
fact.  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F910</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
We are adopted by God in such a manner that we cannot be rejected by him on
account of the treachery of men; for he is faithful, so that he will not cast
off or abandon his people. What the Prophet says in this passage must therefore
refer to our feelings and to outward appearance, because we seem to be rejected
by God when we do not perceive his presence and protection. And it is necessary
that we should thus feel God's wrath, even as a wife divorced by her husband
deplores her condition, that we may know that we are justly chastised. But we
must also perceive his mercy; and because it is infinite and eternal, we shall
find that all afflictions in comparison of it are light and momentary. Whenever,
therefore, we are pressed by adversity, we ought to betake ourselves to this
consolation. At the same time it ought to be observed, that what was said was
actually true as to the whole body of the people, who had been divorced on
account of their wickedness; and although God did not receive all of them
indiscriminately into favor with him, but only the elect remnant, yet there is
nothing absurd or improper in addressing his discourse as if it had been to the
same persons.  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F911</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In a moment of wrath.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He again repeats and enforces this statement,
in order to impress it more deeply on the hearts of believers, that they may not
be at all discouraged by adversity, and with good reason; for, amidst that
frightful darkness, it was not easy for the captives to behold God's smiling
face. And although the literal sense in which the "wrath" is here said to last
but for "a moment"  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F912</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
be, that God in due time brought back the captives to their native country, yet
we draw from it a general doctrine, that the afflictions of the Church are
always momentary, when we raise our eyes to its eternal happiness. We ought to
remember what Paul has taught us,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 4:17) that all the afflictions of believers are light and easy to be
endured, and are justly considered to be momentary, while they look at the
"eternal weight of glory;" for if we do not attend to this comparison, every day
will seem to us like a year. There would be no propriety in comparing the
seventy years of the captivity of the Jews to "a moment," if it were not
contrasted with the uninterrupted progress of the grace of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.

As to the general meaning, it makes little difference; and therefore we ought
chiefly to consider what the Prophet meant, for commentators do not appear to me
to have caught his meaning. They explain it generally, that the Lord promised
to: Noah by an oath, that there would never be a deluge, and that this oath
would perpetually remain in force.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010910&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
9:10) But for this, the good man might have trembled, and, at the approach of
rain, might have dreaded a similar calamity, if the Lord had not sworn that this
should never again happen. In like manner, when afflictions are at hand, we
might dread that we should be ruined, if the Lord did not promise that the
Church would be safe.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But I think that this
ought to be limited to the period of the Babylonish captivity. He compares that
captivity to a deluge, which destroyed the face of the earth; for it appeared as
if the Church was utterly ruined. The people had almost entirely passed over to
another nation, and had no kingdom and no civil government of their own; they
underwent very hard bondage, and thought that their name was wholly
extinguished. And at that time was actually fulfilled what the Prophet formerly
declared,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"If the Lord had not left
to us a seed, we should have been like Sodom and Gomorrah."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
1:9)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Justly, therefore, does he compare that calamity to
"the waters of Noah," that is, to the deluge; and on this account I rather agree
with those who read </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ym
yk</font><font face="Palatino"> <i>(ki me)</i> that is, "For the waters;" for I
consider that reading to rest on better evidence than the other, and it is
generally adopted by Jewish
writers.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is to me.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">I think that we ought carefully to inquire into
the meaning of these words, which are slightly passed over by commentators. He
means that this calamity will resemble the deluge; so that, as he was satisfied
with a single deluge, and would never again send another, so he is satisfied
with this one destruction, so to speak, of the Church, and will never again
permit the face of it to be destroyed. Such is therefore the manner in which I
think that we ought to explain this passage and apply the metaphor, that the
desolation of Judea will be to God like the deluge which happened in "the days
of Noah; " for as he swore at that time that he would never afterwards inflict
such punishment on the crimes which stripped the earth of its inhabitants, so he
will not again destroy the Church, as he did in the Babylonish captivity. And
indeed, whatever might be any confused state of affairs that afterwards
followed, still the Church retained some name, and preserved some form, until,
at the manifestation of Christ in the flesh, the seed of the Gospel was
everywhere scattered, that it might bring sons to God out of all nations. In a
word, the Lord promises that henceforth he will restrain his wrath, and will not
punish his people with so great severity.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It
will be objected, that since that time the Church sustained very grievous
calamities; from which it might be concluded, either that this oath failed of
its accomplishment, or that this is not the Prophet's meaning. I reply, the
Church did not sustain so grievous a calamity as to have its face altogether
destroyed, which happened when the people were carried away into Babylon. For
although Antiochus and other tyrants brought upon it dreadful calamities,
although afterwards there also happened those apostasies which Paul foretold,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;530203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Thessalonians 2:3;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;540401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 4:1,) and everything was defiled by innumerable superstitions, so that
the Christian name was nearly buried; yet still there remained some form of a
Church, however disfigured, and the building was not in so ruinous a condition
that there did not exist some remnants of Christianity above the deluge, so that
this oath was in full
force.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That I will not be
wroth with thee. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This must not be taken in an
absolute, but in a comparative sense. He contrasts this clause with the
preceding; for he promises that he will never chastise his people so severely as
not to mitigate the severity of the punishment. Although therefore tyrants
indulge in wanton and unbridled rage, and Satan employ his utmost efforts in
attacking the Church, and the Lord give him a loose rein, in order to punish our
ingratitude, yet he will never suffer the Church to be
ruined.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the mountains shall
indeed be moved. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He confirms the former
statement, and declares that sooner shall the whole world be turned upside down,
than his mercy shall fail. It would be idle to put the question here, how "the
mountains shall be moved, or the hills shall shake;" for the comparison is drawn
from those things which appear to be strongest and most deeply rooted, in order
to show that the foundation of the Church is far more durable. "Mountains" are
very strong, and earthquakes do not so frequently take place in them as in
plains; and therefore the Lord declares that, although that vast and huge mass
of "mountains be moved," or the heavens fall, yet his covenant shall endure, and
his mercy towards the Church shall not fail. In this sense it is said in the
Psalm, "The Lord shall reign, the world shall be established."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;199301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My mercy.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">In the word "mercy," it ought to be remarked
what is the nature of the foundation of the covenant; for we can have no

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F914</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
covenant of my peace. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He calls it "the covenant
of peace," because the Lord offers to us all that belongs to perfect happiness;
as the Hebrew writers also, under the word "peace," include all posterity. Since
therefore this covenant contains solid and perfect happiness, it follows that
all who are excluded from it are
miserable.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Saith Jehovah, who
hath compassion on thee. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By saying that it is
he "who hath compassion" on her, he again confirms what was formerly said, that

is compassionate and ready to pardon.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.

only that the Church shall be restored to her ancient splendor, but that God
will cause her to be adorned with attire of greater magnificence, as if it had
been wholly composed of precious stones. All this was expressed by Haggai in a
single word, when he said,</font><br></div>

which are here described by the Prophet, and about which even the Hebrew writers
are not agreed, we need not give ourselves much trouble, provided we understand
the meaning of the passage.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This earnest address
is exceedingly well fitted for soothing the grief of believers; for it
represents the Church, which was ready to be drowned, as being now rescued by
him from shipwreck. Whenever therefore we shall see her violently shaken by
tempests, and weighed down by a load of distresses, and deprived of all
consolation, let us remember that these are the very circumstances which induce
God to give assistance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will lay thy windows
with pearls. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By these metaphors he shows that
the condition of the Church, as has been formerly said, will be far better than
at any former period. The Church is compared to a building, which is customary
in every part of Scripture.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;242406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
24:6;

structure. But it ought to be remarked, that the Prophet represents God as the
architect of this building; for this work ought to be entirely ascribed to him
alone.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But it may be asked what the Prophet
means by "carbuncles, sapphires, pearls," and other kinds of jewels; for by a
similar metaphor Paul meant doctrine. "As a wise architect," says he, "I have
laid the foundation." And
again,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"If any man build on this
foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble, every man's work
shall be made manifest."

<i>(vau,) </i>"and," here, as in many other passages, denotes <i>for;</i> and
hence we may easily conclude that Isaiah spoke not of doctrine, but of men, of
which the spiritual building of the Church is reared. It is by doctrine, indeed,
that the Church is built; but, the building of it is effected by assembling men
together, and reducing them to a state of obedience to God. The difference then
between Paul and Isaiah is this, that Paul makes those "precious stones" relate
to doctrine, and Isaiah makes them relate to the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which
are bestowed on men, in order that the Church may be built of them. It is proper
to observe the diversity of gifts with which the Lord adorns his Church; for all
are not. "emeralds," and all are not "carbuncles," but the Lord assigns to every
one his rank according' to his own pleasure.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:11)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Taught by Jehovah.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">It deserves attention, that all that belongs to
the ornament of the Church, proceeds from no other source than from the grace of
God; for if we are "carbuncles" and "sapphires" in consequence of our being
taught by the Lord, it follows that this does not proceed from nature. Now there
are two ways in which the Lord teaches us; by external preaching, and by the
secret revelation of the Holy Spirit. What kind of teaching the Prophet means is
explained by Christ, when he quotes this passage; and therefore we ought not to
seek a better interpreter. "It is written in the prophets," says he, "All shall
be taught by God. Every man who hath heard and learned from the Father cometh to
me."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430604&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
6:4.5) If this passage were to be understood as relating to external preaching,
the conclusion which Christ draws from it would not be well founded; for it does
not follow, "The Gospel is preached, and therefore all believe." Many oppose,
others openly scorn, and others are hypocrites. Those only "who have been
foreordained to life"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;441348&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
13:48) are sincerely teachable, and are entitled to be ranked among the
disciples. The Gospel is preached indiscriminately to the elect and the
reprobate; but the elect alone come to Christ, because they have been "taught by
God," and therefore to them the Prophet undoubtedly
refers.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This makes it evident in what way we
become living and precious stones for building the temple of God. It is when the
Lord has formed and polished us by his Spirit, and has added to the external
preaching of the word the internal efficacy of the Spirit. Hence we learn how
great is the depravity of the human mind, which cannot be bent and formed anew,
unless the Lord move it by the power and efficacy of his Spirit. Isaiah has
connected both modes of teaching, the internal and the external; for he gives
the appellation of "children of the Church" to those who are "taught by the
Lord." If they are her children, they must then have been conceived in her womb
and nourished by her, first "with milk, and next with solid food," as Paul says,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 3:2) till they "grow up and arrive at manhood."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490413&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:13)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Thus the external administration of the
word is necessary if we wish to be disciples; and this shows the extreme madness
of fanatics, who abuse this passage for the purpose of overturning the preaching
of the word and the ministry which the Church enjoys; for they cannot be "the
children" of the Church, if they do not allow themselves to be educated in her.
In vain will they boast of secret revelations; for the Spirit does not teach any
but those who submit to the ministry of the Church, and consequently they are
the disciples of the devil, and not of God, who reject the order which he has
appointed; for we see that these two things, "Children of the Church" and
"Taught by God," are united in such a manner that they cannot be God's disciples
who refuse to be taught in the Church. They ought likewise to be properly
distinguished, as Isaiah also distinguishes them, that we may not apply to men
what ought to be ascribed to the efficacy of the Spirit; but at the same time
they ought to be joined together, so that we may know that in this matter God
chooses to employ the agency of men.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Besides, we
are taught by this passage that the calling of God is efficacious in the elect.
Augustine examines this passage judiciously, and applies it skillfully against
the Pelagians, who extolled man's free-will in opposition to the grace of God.
They appeared, indeed, to ascribe something to the grace of God, but in such a
manner that, when they brought it forward, they gave to it an inferior place to
man's free-will; just as the Papists do, who assert that any person can either
receive or reject it. "But" (says Augustine) "all shall be taught by God. Now,
God's disciples are efficaciously taught, and follow his calling." He likewise
adds that passage of John's Gospel which we have quoted. This shows clearly that
it is not from free choice made by man, and which is capable of being bent in
either direction, that it proceeds.</font><br><font face="Palatino">From these
words it ought also to be observed how highly the Lord values his doctrine, by
means of which he admits us into his building, so that we become "pearls,
sapphires, and carbuncles;" for they who wish to build the Church by rejecting
the doctrine of the word, build a hog's sty, and not the Church of God. We see
also what opinion we ought to form about implicit faith, about which the Papists
yelp, who wish men to become fools, that they may suffer themselves to be
imposed upon; for, since we must be taught by God, it is not reasonable that we
should resemble beasts.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It may be asked, were
not the prophets also, and the patriarchs, and other believers under the Law,
taught by God? They undoubtedly were; but here the Prophet spoke by comparison,
because there is a more abundant revelation in Christ, and the Lord hath spoken
so plainly as to give a public manifestation that he is the teacher of the
Church, and also to gain many disciples. This passage agrees with one in the
Prophet Jeremiah.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Every one shall
not teach his neighbor, nor a man his brother; for all shall know me from the
least even to the greatest, saith Jehovah."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;243134&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
31:34)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Accordingly, if in ancient times it was
necessary that all the children of God should be disciples of the Holy Spirit,
much more in the present day, seeing that this prediction relates strictly to
the kingdom of Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
great peace. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By the word "peace" he denotes
happiness, that is, all prosperity. And hence we may infer what is the true
happiness of men. It is, when God enlightens our understandings, so that we
embrace the salvation which has been revealed to us in Christ; for, so long as
we are destitute of that knowledge, we are at the greatest possible distance
from happiness; because even God's blessings, till they are sanctified by faith,
become a curse to us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In righteousness.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He means that God will be the maker and
architect of his Church. I am aware that there are some who explain it
differently, and who think that "righteousness" means "good-works." And indeed
that exposition has some plausibility, arising from the Prophet having spoken
about doctrine; for we are taught for this very purpose, that we may lead a
pious and holy life. But the Prophet's meaning was different, namely, that the
Church shall be restored under God's guidance, who wishes to be its guardian and
defender, he contrasts "righteousness" with the violence and oppression by which
the Church has been thrown down, or, at least, he expresses "stability," as if
he had said that it shall not be a frail building, or one that might impose on
men for a short time by mere deceitfulness of appearance; because God will
sincerely defend his work, and, being "righteous," will not only restore it
completely, but will afterwards preserve it in safety for a long period. Thus,
although men are leagued in every way for the destruction of the Church, they
will gain nothing; for the Lord guards her by his "righteousness." We have
formerly  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F916</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
seen this form of expression; and on this account I think that the
interpretation which I have given is more simple, though some may think that
another interpretation is more plausible.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, he who assembleth
shall assemble. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The general import is, that,
although many rise up for the purpose of overwhelming the Church, yet all their
efforts and attacks shall fail; and he appears to promise God's assistance not
only against external foes, but against foes that are domestic and internal.
Many "assemble" in the bosom of the Church, as if they wished to join themselves
to her, but afterwards carry on internal war. These words are commonly
translated, "By gathering he shall gather himself against thee," and are
generally understood to relate to all the enemies of the Church of every kind.
That interpretation is most generally approved; nor do I object to it, provided
that it be acknowledged to include the fraud, and ambush, and treachery by which
the Church is attacked. Yet I have no doubt that here the meaning is the same as
in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;190201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
2:1, namely, the conspiracies and insurrections of the Gentiles against Christ
and the Church of God; for not a single nation only, but various nations rise up
against, her.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is probable, however, that here
he expressly joins together domestic foes and those who from without had
penetrated even into her bosom; for he says,<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In thee, Against
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> that is, "They shall attack thee
within, in the midst of thee." In a word, he shows that the Church will not
enjoy such peace as not to be attacked by many adversaries. But it may be
thought that these statements are contradictory; for he formerly said that she
would be far from terror and oppression, and now he says that there shall be
conspiracies within her bosom. I reply, the Prophet instantly added this, that
believers might not promise to themselves a state of peace in the world, as if
they had no annoyance to suffer from wicked men and hypocrites. The defense of
the Church against oppression and slander shall be of such a kind as not to
preserve her from carrying on uninterrupted war with enemies; for Satan will
raise up against her every day new attacks, so that she can never be at rest.
These words may therefore be regarded as a correction of the preceding
statement, in order that believers may always carry their weapons of war, and
may not promise to themselves
repose.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Without me.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">A promise is added, that the Lord will
nevertheless preserve them in the midst of dangers. Without God signifies "in
vain" or "unsuccessfully; " for he means that the attacks of wicked men, though
they do their utmost  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F917</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
shall utterly fail. They rush forward with blind fury, but it is the Lord's hand
alone that gives prosperity. He alludes to what was formerly said,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234125&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
41:25) that the Babylonians should come, under God's guidance, to destroy Judea.
At that time the people were ruined, because they had God for their enemy; but
now, because "without God," that is, without his guidance, the enemies shall
attack her, they shall be ashamed and turn back. This is more fully expressed by
what immediately follows
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He who shall assemble
in thee shall fall against thee. </i></font><font face="Palatino">That is, "All
that he shall attempt against thee shall fall back on his own head. Though the
whole world rise up against thee, it shall be crushed by its own weight." The
phrase, in thee, deserves notice; for when the Lord drives our enemies to a
distance, we are confident, but if they come near us, we fall into despair.
Therefore he says, "Although they penetrate even into thy bowels, the Lord will
destroy them, and will deliver thee."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I have created the
workmen. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The Lord shows how easily and readily
he delivers his Church from the base attacks of wicked men; for they can do
nothing but so far as the Lord permits them, though he makes use of them as
instruments for chastising his people. Moreover, this may be appropriately
viewed as referring both to the Babylonians and to other foes who afterwards
distressed the elect people. If the former sense be preferred, God undertakes to
prove that he can easily drive away those whom he led against them, and east
down those whom he raised up. If it be supposed to refer to Antiochus and others
of the same description, the meaning will not be very different; namely, that
they too shall not be permitted to hurt them, because they cannot even move a
finger but by God's direction.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But it may be
thought that the Prophet contradicts himself; for in the former verse he said,
that wicked men attack the Church "without the Lord," and now he says that they
fight under God as their leader, that under his guidance and direction they may
waste and destroy. I reply, we must keep in view the contrast; namely, that the
Lord had raised up the Babylonians to destroy the Church. We must observe the
metaphor of the deluge, by which he denoted utter extermination; for at that
time the Church might be said to have been drowned, and he made use of the
Babylonians as his agents for that purpose. But he solemnly declares that
henceforth he is resolved to restrain his anger, so as never to permit the
Church to be destroyed by her enemies, though he chastise her by his own hand.
The object at which the enemies of the Church aim, and which they labor with all
their might to accomplish, is to ruin and destroy the Church; but the Lord
restrains their attacks; for "without him," that is, without his command, they
do nothing. Some explain the meaning to be, that. "the workman has been created
for his work," that is, that he may effect his own destruction, and the waster,
to destroy himself. But the former sense appears to me more
simple.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have created the
waster to destroy. </i></font><font face="Palatino">When the Lord says that he
"createth the waster," this does not refer merely to the nature with which men
are born, but to the very act of "wasting." And yet we must not, on that
account, lay blame on God, as if he were the author of the unjust cruelty which
dwells in men alone; for God does not give assent to their wicked inclinations,
but regulates their efforts by his secret providence, and employs them as the
instruments of his anger. But on this subject we have treated in the exposition
of other passages.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every weapon.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He again infers what has been already said,
that wicked men, even though they exert themselves to the utmost, will gain
nothing; for their attacks are guided and restrained by the secret, purpose of
God. He makes use of the word "every," meaning by it that wicked men will have
the means of attempting many and diversified methods for destroying the Church,
but that their efforts shall be vain and fruitless,  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F918</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for the Lord will restrain them. Heaven permits them, indeed, to a great extent,
in order to try the patience of believers; but, when God thinks proper, he
strips them of their strength and
armor.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And every tongue.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">After having spoken of the "weapons" with which
wicked men attack the Church, he expressly mentions the "tongue; " because no
other "weapon" is so deadly and destructive. Not only do they revile, and
slander, and defame the servants of God, but, as far as lies in their power,
they extinguish the truth of God, and alienate the hearts of men from it; which
ought to distress us more than if life were taken from us a hundred times.
Besides, good and upright men find slander to be more distressing, and to
inflict more severe pain than any bodily stroke; and, therefore, there was good
reason for mentioning this deadly
"weapon."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That shall rise up
against thee in judgment. </i></font><font face="Palatino">When he says that
tongues "rise up in judgment," he means that wicked men are so daring and
insolent, that they openly attack and annoy the children of God. He adds that
this is done "in judgment; " because they hold out plausible pretexts, which
give them the appearance of having a just cause. In like manner, the Papists,
when they call us heretics, schismatics, and dogs, plead against us, as it were,
"in judgment," and wish to be regarded as the defenders of catholic truth,
though they maintain falsehood and idolatry. And yet so plausible are the
pretexts by which their slanders are covered, that they produce very strong
hatred against us among those who are ignorant of our cause. But although they
assail us by arms, and by the "tongue," and by "weapons" of every kind, yet,
relying on this prediction, let us hope that we shall be victorious; for victory
is here promised to us, and, since we are certain of it, we ought to fight
valiantly and with unshaken
courage.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is the
inheritance. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He shows that the Lord has granted
this to believers, as it were, by a right of "inheritance," so that they shall
never be deprived of it; for, as no title is more certain than that of an heir,
so he shows that there is nothing of which the Lord's servants ought to be more
certain than of his constant guardianship and preservation, by which he defends
them against all dangers.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
their righteousness from me. </i></font><font face="Palatino">"Righteousness"
here denotes what is conveyed by us in the ordinary expression, (<i>Leur
droit,</i>) "Their right." In a word, he means that the Lord will defend his
people, so as to protect their innocence. Whenever, therefore, we are attacked
and injured by men, let us learn to betake ourselves forthwith to the Lord; for,
when we seek other assistance, the consequence is, that we are deprived of his
guardianship and protection.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ho, all that are thirsty.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet describes in lofty terms of
commendation the goodness of God, which was to be poured down more copiously and
abundantly than before under the reign of Christ, "in whose hand are hid all the
treasures"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;510203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:3) of the grace of God; for in him God fully explains his mind to us; so that
the saying of John is actually fulfilled, "We have all drawn from his fullness,
and have received grace for grace."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
1:16) The fathers were, indeed, partakers of that divine goodness and spiritual
kindness which is here mentioned. "How great," says David, "is thy goodness,
which hath been laid up for them that fear thee!"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193119&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
31:19) But he hath poured it out far more liberally and abundantly in Christ.
Thus, it is a remarkable commendation of the grace of God, which is exhibited to
us in the kingdom of Christ; for the Prophet does not instruct us what has been
done once, but also what is done every day, while the Lord invites us by his
doctrine to the enjoyment of all
blessings.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come to the waters.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Some view the word "waters" as referring to the
doctrine of the Gospel, and others to the Holy Spirit; but neither of these
expositions, in my opinion, is correct. They who think that it denotes the
doctrine of the Gospel, and who contrast it with the law, (of which the Jewish
writers think that the Prophet speaks in this passage,) include only one part of
what the Prophet meant. They who expound it as denoting the Holy Spirit have
somewhat more plausibility, and quote that passage of John's
Gospel,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"If thou knewest the gift
of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have
asked of him, and he would have given thee living water."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430410&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
4:10)</font><br><font face="Palatino">And a little after, Christ appears to
expound this passage when he
says,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Every one that drinketh of
this water shall thirst again; but whosoever shall drink of the water which I
shall give to him shall never thirst; but the water which I shall give to him
shall become in him a fountain of water springing up to everlasting life."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430413&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
4:13, 14)</font><br><font face="Palatino">But I have no doubt that under these
words, "waters, milk, wine, bread," Isaiah includes all that is necessary for
spiritual life; for the metaphors are borrowed from those kinds of food which
are in daily use amongst us. As we are nourished by "bread, wine, milk, and
water," so in like manner let us know that our souls are fed and supported by
the doctrine of the Gospel, the Holy Spirit, and other gifts of
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet exclaims, as with a voice
above the usual pitch, <i>He! </i>for so great is the sluggishness of men that
it is very difficult to arouse them. They do not feel their wants, though they
are hungry; nor do they desire food, which they greatly need; and therefore that
indifference must be shaken off by loud and incessant cries. So much the more
base and shameful is the indolence of those who are deaf to this exhortation,
and who, even when they are so sharply urged forward, still indulge in their
slothfulness. Besides, the invitation is general; for there is no man who is not
in want of those "waters," and to whom Christ is not necessary; and therefore he
invites all indiscriminately, without any respect of persons. But men are so
miserable that, although they know that they are in need of Christ, they
contrive methods by which they may be deprived of this benefit, and rather
believe the devil, who offers various obstructions, than this kind
invitation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We must therefore inquire what is
the true preparation for receiving this grace. The Prophet describes it by the
word "thirsty." Those who are puffed up with vain confidence and are satiated,
or who, intoxicated by earthly appetites, do not feel thirst of soul, will not
receive Christ; because they have no relish for spiritual grace. They resemble
those persons who are in want of nourishments, but who, because they are filled
and swollen with wind, loathe food, or who, being carried away by their own vain
imaginations, feed on their own stupidity, as if they were in want of nothing.
The consequence is, that they who are puffed up with pride or a false opinion of
their own righteousness, or whom the allurements of the flesh have seized with
lethargy, despise or reject the grace of God. It is therefore necessary that we
have "thirst," that is, an ardent desire, in order that it may be possible for
us to receive so great
blessings.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Buy without money.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He does not mean that there are any persons who
have money in abundance, but the words ought to be explained thus. "Although
they are poor, although they are sunk in the deepest poverty, yet the way is
open for them to come to Christ, through whom these blessings are freely
bestowed." "But how is it possible," it will be said, "to buy without a price?"
I reply, "buying" denotes figuratively the method by which we procure anything;
and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rb&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>shabar</i>) is here put for "procure," and "price" for labor or industry, or
any other method by which men obtain anything, he shows that we are poor and
utterly destitute, and that we have nothing by which we can become entitled to
God's favor; but that he kindly invites us, in order that he may freely bestow
everything without any recompense.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore do ye spend money?
</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F919</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He complains of the ingratitude and madness of men, in rejecting or disdaining
the kindness of God who offers all things freely, and yet harassing themselves
greatly about various trifles which cannot yield them any advantage. Men are so
enchanted by the devil, that they choose rather to wander through deserts, and
to vex themselves in vain, than to rely on the grace which God offers to them.
The experience of the present age abundantly shows that the Prophet not only
expostulated with his own nation, but exclaimed against all men, to whatever age
they might belong; for all the posterity of Adam have been seized with such
madness that, in seeking the road to a heavenly life, 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F920</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
they altogether go astray, and follow their own vain opinions rather than the
voice of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet does not complain of
the slothfulness of those who, altogether forgetful of themselves and of God,
take no concern about the spiritual life of the soul; (there are many such
persons;) but of those who desire life, and yet do not understand the method or
way of obtaining it, and wander in uncertainty through deserts and untrodden
paths. Here, therefore, are condemned all the methods which men contrive, in
opposition to the Word of God, for obtaining salvation, and they are pronounced
to be useless expenses; for by the word "money" he denotes all the industry,
study, or labor which belongs to man. Not that God values a single farthing all
our idle attempts to worship him, but because labors foolishly undertaken are
reckoned valuable by the judgment of the
flesh.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And your labor, not so
as to be satisfied. </i></font><font face="Palatino">We see that by the word
"bread" is here meant the same as was formerly meant by "waters," and that he
gives the name "labor" to that which he formerly called "money." As if he had
said, "Men toil without any advantage; for, when they follow their own
inventions, however eagerly they may vex and weary themselves, they have no
right to expect any reward." Thus he affirms that they who labor in an
inconsiderate manner cannot "be satisfied; " for they who forsake God, and
attempt new methods of salvation, can never "be satisfied." "They feed on wind,"
as Hosea says.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;281201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
12:1) They may, indeed, imagine that they are full, when they are swelled with
vain confidence, but are like persons who, in consequence of being swollen with
wind, do not perceive their hunger. Yet it would be better for them to be sore
pressed by hunger and thirst, that it might lead them to call on the Lord with
earnestness of heart, as it is said in the Psalm, "My soul is as a thirsty land
before thee."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19E306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
143:6) But bread alone, or water alone, would not be enough to "satisfy," and by
neither of them could life be supported; and that is the reason why the Prophet
has made use of a variety of terms, in order to show that the Lord abundantly
supplies everything that is necessary for life, that we may not think that we
ought to seek aid from any other
quarter.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear ye by hearing
me. </i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F921</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Because every person is led into error by his own counsel, and all who neglect
God vanish away in wicked imaginations, the Prophet here adds the remedy, which
is, that we must depend entirely on the mouth of God. Whoever shall submit to
his word will have no reason to fear that he shall spend his strength on things
of no value. Here we see the amazing goodness of God, who offers his grace to
men, though they are unthankful and
unworthy.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But he adds the condition; for there
is no way by which we can enter into life but by "hearing" him; and as the cause
of our destruction is, that we are deaf to the voice of God, so the road to life
is open, if we lend our ears to him.  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F922</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In order to make a deeper impression upon us, he repeats the same admonition,
and doubles the same word, "Hear ye by hearing; " and, in order to draw us more
gently, he solemnly declares that it depends entirely on ourselves whether or
not he will "delight" us even to fullness with all abundance of
blessings.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Incline your ear.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">This assemblage of words makes still more
evident what I slightly mentioned a little before, that God leaves nothing
undone which is fitted to correct and arouse our tardiness. Yet there is an
implied reproof; for they must be excessively stupid who, when they are so
gently called, do not instantly obey. This is a remarkable passage, from which
we see that our whole happiness lies in obeying the word of God. When God speaks
in this manner, the object which he has in view is to lead us to life;  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F923</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and therefore the blame lies wholly with ourselves, because we disregard this
saving and life-giving
word.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And come unto me.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">If God only commanded what we ought to do, he
would indeed lay down the method of obtaining life, but without advantage; for
the Law, which proceeded from the mouth of God, is the minister of death; but
when he invites us "to himself," when he adopts us as children, when he promises
pardon of sin and sanctification, the consequence is, that they who hear obtain
life from him. We ought, therefore, to take into view the kind of doctrine which
contains life, in order that we may seek our salvation from it; and hence we
infer that there is no hope of salvation if we do not obey God and his word.
This reproves all mankind, so that they can plead no excuse for their ignorance;
for he who refuses to hear can have no solid argument to defend his
cause.</font><br><font face="Palatino">These repetitions describe the patience
of God in calling us; for he does not merely invite us once, but when he sees
that we are sluggish, he gives a second and even a third warning, in order to
conquer our hardheartedness. Thus he does not all at once reject those who
despise him, but after having frequently invited
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Besides, this is a description of the
nature of faith, when he bids us "come to himself." We ought to hear the Lord in
such a manner that faith shall follow; for they who by faith receive the word of
God have laid aside their desires and despised the world, and may be said to
have broken their chains, so that they readily and cheerfully "draw near to
God." But faith cannot be formed without hearing,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451017&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:17 ) that is, without understanding the word of God, and so he bids us "hear"
before we "come to him." Thus, whenever faith is mentioned, let us remember that
it must be joined to the word, in which it has its
foundation.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will strike
a covenant of eternity with you. </i></font><font face="Palatino">It is asked,
Did not the Jews formerly enter into an everlasting covenant with God? For he
appears to promise something that is new and uncommon. I reply, nothing new is
here promised for which the Lord did not formerly enter into an engagement with
his people; but it is a renewal and confirmation of the covenant, that the Jews
might not think that the covenant of God was made void on account of the
long-continued banishment. For when they were banished from the country that had
been promised to them,  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F924</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
when they had no temple or sacrifices, or any marks of the "covenant" except
circumcision, who would not have concluded that it was all over with them? This
mode of expression, therefore, Isaiah accommodated to the capacity of the
people, that they might know that the covenant into which God entered with the
fathers was firm, sure, and eternal, and not changeable or
temporary.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This is also what he means by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the mercies of
David,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> but by this phrase he declares that it
was a covenant of free grace; for it was founded on nothing else than the
absolute goodness of God. Whenever, therefore, the word "covenant" occurs in
Scripture, we ought at the same time to call to remembrance the word "grace." By
calling them "the <i>faithful </i>mercies of David,"  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F925</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he declares that he will be faithful in it, and at. the same time states
indirectly that he is faithful and steadfast, and cannot be accused of
falsehood, as if he had broken his covenant; that the Jews, on the other hand,
are covenant-breakers and traitors, (for they have revolted from him,) but that
he cannot repent of his covenant or his
promise.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He calls them "the mercies <i>of
David</i>," because this covenant, which has now been solemnly confirmed, was
made in the land "of David." The Lord indeed entered into a covenant with
Abraham,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011505&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
15:5; 17:7) afterwards confirmed it by Moses,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;020224&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
2:24; 33:1) and finally ratified this very covenant in the hand of David, that
it might be eternal.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;100712&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 7:12) Whenever, therefore, the Jews thought of a Redeemer, that is, of
their salvation, they ought to have remembered "David" as a mediator who
represented Christ; for David must not here be regarded as a private individual,
but as bearing this title and character. Yet some regard must be had to the time
when this prophecy was uttered; for, since the rank of the kingdom had been
obliterated, and the name of the royal family had become mean and contemptible
during the captivity in Babylon, it might seem as if, through the ruin of that
family, the truth of God had fallen into decay; and therefore he bids them
contemplate by faith the throne of David, which had been cast
down.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I have given him a
witness to the peoples. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet now
explains more fully the reason why he mentioned "David." It was because into his
hand had been committed the promise of a Redeemer that was to come, and this
discourse might be expressed with a view to his public character, so far as he
was the surety of the covenant; for he did not act for himself individually, but
was appointed to be a sort of mediator between God and the people. Yet it is
beyond all doubt that the Prophet leads them directly to Christ, to whom the
transition from David was easy and natural; as if he had said, "That successor
of David shall come forth, by whose hand perfect salvation and happiness hath
been promised."</font><br><font face="Palatino">By calling him "a witness," he
means that the covenant into which he entered shall be ratified and confirmed in
Christ. There is a weighty meaning in the word "witness;" for he clearly shows
that this covenant shall be proved in Christ, by whom the truth of God shall be
made manifest. He will! testify that God is not false. But this testimony
consists in doctrine; and if it were not added, we should receive little benefit
from Christ's coming, as it is said, "I will publish the command."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;190207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
2:7) In this sense also Isaiah said in another passage, that Christ will have a
mouth like a sword or an arrow.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234902&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
49:2)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A leader and instructor.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">This is added, in order to procure attention to
his doctrine; for, if we do not hear him when he speaks, and if we do not
embrace by assured faith what he makes known to us concerning the Father's good
pleasure, his power is set aside. In like manner, the name of Christ is
pronounced loudly enough by the Papists; but since they refuse to receive him as
a teacher and instructor, and acknowledge him merely by name, their boasting is
idle and ridiculous.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the
peoples. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This was added for the purpose of
amplification, because the Church could not be restored to her ancient dignity,
or be enlarged, but by assembling the Gentiles; and therefore it. was necessary
that the voice of Christ should pierce even to the remotest countries, because
he has been appointed a "witness, leader, and instructor" to the whole human
race.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, thou shalt call a
nation which thou knowest not. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Isaiah explains
more largely what he formerly glanced at by a single word; for he declares that
Christ shall be the "leader," not of a single people, but of all the peoples.
"To call" here denotes possession; for there is a mutual relation between the
words "call" and "answer." Christ therefore "calls" in the exercise of
authority, as one who is invested with supreme power; and he "calls" the
Gentiles, that he may bring them into a state of obedience, and may cause them
to submit to his word.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He says that they shall
be ready to obey, though hitherto they were unknown; not that the Son of God, by
whom they were created, did not know them, but because he paid no regard to them
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F926</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
until they began to be reckoned as belonging to the Church. God had in a
peculiar manner called the Jews; the Gentiles appeared to be excluded as if they
did not at all belong to him. But now, addressing Christ,  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F927</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he promises that Christ shall constrain the Gentiles to obey him, though
formerly they were opposed to his authority. He expresses this still more
plainly in what immediately
follows.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A nation that knew
not thee shall run to thee. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By putting the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wxwry</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>yarutzu</i>) <i>shall run, </i>in the plural number, he intends to explain
more fully that the Church shall be collected out of various peoples, so that
they who were formerly scattered shall be gathered into one body; for the word
"run" relates to harmony of faith. When he now says that the Gentiles "did not
know Christ," he employs the expression in a different sense from that in which
he said, a little before, that they were unknown to Christ; for all heathens and
unbelievers are declared, in a literal sense, to be in a state of ignorance, in
consequence of their being destitute of the light of heavenly doctrine, without
which they cannot. have the knowledge of God. Although by nature the knowledge
of God is engraven on the hearts of all men, yet it is so confused and dark, and
entangled by many errors, that, if the light of the word be not added to it, by
knowing they know not God, but wander miserably in
darkness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here we have a remarkable testimony of
God as to the calling of the Gentiles, for whom, as well as for the Jews, Christ
was appointed. Hence also we learn that God takes care of us, if we bow to his
authority, and not only such care as he takes of all the creatures, but such
care as a father takes of his children.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet the
word "run" describes more fully the efficacy of this calling, for the object of
it is, that we shall obey God, that we shall readily and cheerfully place
ourselves before him as teachable, and ready to comply with any expression of
his will; in like manner, as Paul shows that obedience is the end of our
calling.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:5; 16:26) But as the Gentiles were at a great distance from God, it was
necessary that they should labor earnestly to surmount every obstacle, that they
might draw near to him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For
the sake of Jehovah thy God. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He shows what is
the source of this readiness and cheerfulness. It is because the Gentiles shall
know that they have to do with God; for, if we contemplate Christ merely as man,
we shall not be powerfully affected by his doctrine, but when we behold God in
him, an astonishing warmth of affection is kindled in our hearts. Now, Christ is
here described as a minister appointed by God to perform his work; for he
assumes the character of a servant along with our flesh, and in this respect
there is no impropriety in his being subjected to the Father, as if he belonged
to the rank of other men.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet we ought to keep
in remembrance what we have frequently seen as to the union of the Head and the
members; for what is now said concerning Christ relates to the whole body, and
therefore the glorifying is common to the whole Church. Yet Christ always holds
the highest rank; for, being raised on high, he is exalted above the whole
world, that to him there may be a concourse of all nations. In a word, he shows
that men obey Christ and submit to his doctrine, because God hath exalted him,
and hath determined to make his pre-eminence known to all men; for otherwise the
preaching of the gospel would be of little use, if God did not give power and
efficacy to his doctrine by the Spirit.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Seek ye Jehovah.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">After having spoken of the good success of the
gospel among the Gentiles, who formerly were strangers to the kingdom of God, he
urges the Jews to be ashamed of loitering while others run; for since they were
the first who were called, it is shameful that they should be last. This
exhortation, therefore, relates strictly to the Jews, to whom the example of the
Gentiles is held out in order to excite their jealousy; in the same manner as
the Lord hath foretold that "he would provoke the Jews to jealousy by a foolish
nation."

limited a fixed day for his good-pleasure and our salvation.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234908&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
49:8) Yet I readily admit that it likewise denotes the time when necessity
prompts us to seek God's assistance; but we ought chiefly to remember that God
is sought at a seasonable time, when of his own accord he advances to meet us;
for in vain shall indolent and sluggish persons lament that they had been
deprived of that grace which they rejected. The Lord sometimes endures our
sluggishness, and bears with us; but if ultimately he do not succeed, he will
withdraw, and will bestow his grace on others. For this reason Christ exhorts us
to walk while it is day, for the night cometh when the means of pursuing our
journey shall be taken from us.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431235&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
12:35) We ought to draw high consolation from being assured that it is not in

shall be opened; ask, and it shall be given to you."

7:7)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Call upon him while he is
near. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The word "call" may here be taken in a
general sense; but I think that it denotes one description of" seeking" God,
which is of more importance than all the others, as if he commanded us to betake
ourselves to him by prayers and supplications. He says that he is "near," when
he opens the door and gently invites us to come to him, or when he comes forth
publicly, so that we do not need to seek him through long windings. But we must
attend to Paul's definition, who tells us that it denotes the preaching of the
gospel.

we do not need to seek far, or to make long circuits, as unbelievers do; for he
exhibits himself to us in his word, that we, on our part, may draw near to
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let the wicked man forsake
his way. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He confirms the former statement; for,
having formerly called men to receive the grace of God, he now describes more
largely the manner of receiving it. We know how hypocrites loudly call on God
whenever they desire relief from their distresses, and yet shut up their hearts
by wicked obstinacy;  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F929</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and therefore, that the Jews may not be hypocritical in seeking God, he exhorts
them to sincere piety. Hence we infer that the doctrine of repentance ought
always to accompany the promise of salvation; for in no other way can men taste
the goodness of God than by abhorring themselves on account of their sins, and
renouncing themselves and the world. And indeed no man will sincerely desire to
be reconciled to God and to obtain pardon of sins till he is moved by a true and
earnest repentance.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By three forms of expression
he describes the nature of repentance, &#8212; <i>first, </i>"Let the wicked man
forsake, his way;" <i>secondly, </i>"The unrighteous man his thoughts;"
<i>thirdly, </i>"Let him return to the Lord." Under the word <i>way </i>he
includes the whole course of life, and accordingly demands that they bring forth
the fruits of righteousness as witnesses of their newness of life. By adding the
word thoughts he intimates that we must not only correct outward actions, but
must begin with the heart; for although in the opinion of men we appear to
change our manner of life for the better, yet we shall have made little
proficiency if the heart be not changed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Thus
repentance embraces a change of the whole man; for in man we view inclinations,
purposes, and then works. The works of men are visible, but the root within is
concealed. This must first be changed, that it may afterwards yield fruitful
works. We must first wash away from the mind all uncleanness, and conquer wicked
inclinations, that outward testimonies may afterwards be added. And if any man
boast that he has been changed, and yet live as he was wont to do, it will be
vain-boasting; for both are requisite, conversion of the heart, and change of
life.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Besides, God does not command us to return
to him before he has applied a remedy to revolt; for hypocrites will willingly
endure that we praise what is good and right, provided that they be at liberty
to crouch amidst their filth. But we can have nothing to do with God if we do
not withdraw from ourselves, especially when we have been alienated by wicked
variance; and therefore self-denial goes before, that it may lead us to
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he will have mercy on
him. </i></font><font face="Palatino">We ought carefully to examine this
context, for he shows that men cannot be led to repentance in any other way than
by holding out assurance of pardon. Whoever, then, inculcates the doctrine of
repentance, without mentioning the mercy of God and reconciliation through free
grace, labors to no purpose; just as the Popish doctors imagine that they have
discharged their duty well when they have dwelt largely on this point, and yet
do but chatter and trifle about the doctrine of repentance. But although they
taught the true method of repenting, yet it would be of little avail, seeing
that they leave out the foundation of freely-bestowed pardon, by which alone
consciences can be pacified. And indeed, as we have formerly said, a sinner will
always shrink from the presence of God so long as he is dragged to his
judgment-seat to give an account of his life, and will never be subdued to fear
and obedience till his heart is brought into a state of
peace.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For he aboundeth in
pardoning. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Now, because it is difficult to
remove terror from trembling minds, Isaiah draws all argument from the nature of
God, that he will be ready to pardon and to be reconciled. Thus the Holy Spirit
dwells on this part of doctrine, because we always doubt whether or not God is
willing to pardon us; for, although we entertain some thoughts of his mercy, yet
we do not venture fully to believe that, it belongs to us. It is not without
reason, therefore, that this clause is added, that we may not be hindered by
uncertainty or doubt as to his infinite compassion toward
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For my thoughts are not your
thoughts. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This passage is expounded in various
ways. Some think that it condemns universally the life of men, that they may not
be satisfied with it or flatter their vices; for we cannot approach to God but
by taking away a false conviction of our own righteousness. And indeed none call
for physicians but those who are driven by the violence of disease to seek both
health and remedies. Accordingly, this passage is compared by them to that
saying of our Lord,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"What ranks high among
men is abomination in the sight of God."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;421615&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Luke
16:15)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Prophet's meaning, I think, is different, and
is more correctly explained, according to my judgment, by other commentators,
who think that he draws a distinction between God's disposition and man's
disposition. Men are wont to judge and measure God from themselves; for their
hearts are moved by angry passions, and are very difficult to be appeased; and
therefore they think that they cannot be reconciled to God, when they have once
offended him. But the Lord shows that he is far from resembling men. As if he
had said, "I am not a mortal man, that I should show myself to be harsh and
irreconcilable to you. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F930</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
My thoughts are very different from yours. If you are implacable, and can with
difficulty be brought back to a state of friendship with those from whom you
have received an injury, I am not like you, that I should treat you so
cruelly."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For as the heavens are higher
than the earth. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This agrees well with that
passage in which David, describing the mercy of God, says,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A311&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
103:11) that it is as much more excellent "as the heavens are higher than the
earth;" for although the application is different, yet the meaning is the same.
In short, God is infinitely compassionate and infinitely ready to forgive; so
that it ought to be ascribed exclusively to our unbelief, if we do not obtain
pardon from him.  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F931</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">There
is nothing that troubles our consciences more than when we think that God is
like ourselves; for the consequence is, that we do not venture to approach to
him, and flee from him as an enemy, and are never at rest. But they who measure
God by themselves as a standard form a false idea and altogether contrary to his
nature; and indeed they cannot do him a greater injury than this. Are men, who
are corrupted and debased by sinful desires, not ashamed to compare God's lofty
and uncorrupted nature with their own, and to confine what is infinite within
those narrow limits by which they feel themselves to be wretchedly restrained?
In what prison could any of us be more straightly shut up than in our own
unbelief?</font><br><font face="Palatino">This appears to me to be the plain and
simple meaning of the Prophet. And yet I do not deny that he alludes, at the
same time, to the life of men such as he formerly described it to be. In a word,
he means that men must forget themselves, when they wish to be converted to God,
and that no obstacle can be greater or more destructive than when we think that
God is irreconcilable. We must therefore root out of our minds this false
imagination.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moreover, we learn from it how
widely they err who abuse the mercy of God, so as to draw from it greater
encouragement to sin. The Prophet reasons thus, "Repent, forsake your ways; for
the mercy of God is infinite." When men despair or doubt as to obtaining pardon,
they usually become more hardened and obstinate; but when they feel that God is
merciful, this draws and converts them. It follows, therefore, that they who do
not cease to live wickedly, and who are not changed in heart, have no share in
this mercy.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Surely, as the rain cometh
down. </i></font><font face="Palatino">After having spoken of God's tender
affection and inconceivable forbearance towards us, he again brings forward the
promises, that, by relying on them, we may banish all doubt of being free from
every danger. It would be of little avail to speak to us about the nature or the
secret purpose of God, if we were not reminded of "the word," by which he
reveals himself. Now, God speaks openly to us, so that it is unnecessary to make
longer inquiry. We must. therefore come to the word, in which his will is
declared without obscurity, provided that all our senses are confined within
those limits; for otherwise we remain in suspense, and doubt what he has
determined concerning us, even though the Lord declare a thousand times that he
is altogether unlike men; for, although men acknowledge this, yet they wish to
be certain about themselves and their salvation.  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F932</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For this reason we ought carefully to observe the order which is followed by the
Prophet. Thus also Moses recalled the people to the knowledge of God. "Say not
thou, Who shall ascend to heaven? or, Who shall descend into the deep? The word
is nigh, in thy mouth and in thy heart."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;053012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
30:12) "That is," saith Paul, "the word of faith which we preach."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451008&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:8)</font><br><font face="Palatino">He employs a comparison drawn from daily
experience and wonderfully appropriate; for, if we see great efficacy in the
rain, which waters and fertilizes the earth, much greater efficacy will God
display in his word. The rain is transitory and liable to corruption; but the
word is eternal, unchangeable, and incorruptible, and cannot, like the rain,
vanish away.</font><br><font face="Palatino">That we may more fully understand
the Prophet's words, we must keep in view the end at which he aims. Men doubt if
God will actually perform what he promises in his word; for we look upon the
word, as if it were suspended in the air and had no effect. How shocking this
is, he demonstrates from the very course of nature; for it is in the highest
degree unreasonable to ascribe less to the word than to a dumb creature; and
therefore he teaches us, that his word never fails of its effect. Some
understand this to mean that the preaching of the Gospel is never unprofitable,
but always produces some fruit. This is true in itself; for the Lord worketh by
his Spirit, and "giveth increase,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460307&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 3:7) so that the labor of his servants is not unproductive. But the
Prophet's meaning was different; namely, that God does not speak in vain or
scatter his promises into the air, but that we shall actually receive the fruit
of them, provided that we do not prevent it by our
unbelief.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But watereth the
earth, and causeth it to bring forth. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He
mentions two effects produced by the watering of the rain, which fertilizes the
earth; first, that men have abundance of food for their support; and secondly,
that they have seed for procuring a crop in the following year. If therefore in
things of a transitory nature the power of God is so great, what must we think
of the word? 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F933</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So shall my word be.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">The word goeth out of the mouth of God in such
a manner that it likewise "goeth out of the mouth" of men; for God does not
speak openly from heaven, but employs men as his instruments, that by their
agency he may make known his will. But the authority of the promises is more
fully confirmed, when we are told that they proceed from the sacred mouth of
God. Although, therefore, he brings forward witnesses from the earth, he
declares that all that they have promised shall be ratified and sure; and, in
order to impress more deeply on the minds of men the power and efficacy of
preaching, he declares that he does not cast that precious seed at random, but
appoints it for a fixed purpose, and consequently that we ought to entertain no
doubt as to the effect; for there is nothing to which mortals are more prone
than to judge of God from themselves so as to withhold belief from his
voice.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This doctrine must be frequently repeated
and inculcated, that we may know that God will do what. he hath once spoken. For
this reason, when we hear the promises of God, we ought to consider what is his
design in them; so that, when he promises the free pardon of our sins, we may be
fully assured that we are reconciled through Christ. But, as the word of God is
efficacious for the salvation of believers, so it is abundantly efficacious for
condemning the wicked; as Christ also teacheth, "The word which I have spoken,
that shall judge him at the last day."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore ye shall go out
with joy. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet concludes the subject of
this chapter; for, when he spoke of the mercy of God, his object was, to
convince the Jews that the Lord would deliver them. He now applies to his
purpose what was contained in his discourse concerning the infinite goodness of
God, and shows that his thoughts are very unlike the thoughts of men. And the
true way of teaching is this, that we should apply general statements for
present use. Finally, he treats of the restoration of the people, which depended
on the undeserved mercy of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The mountains and hills
shall break out before you. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By "the mountains
and hills" he means that everything which they shall meet in the journey, though
in other respects it be injurious, shall aid those who shall return to
Jerusalem. They are metaphors, by which he shows that all the creatures bow to
the will of God, and rejoice and lend their aid to carry on his work. He alludes
to the deliverance from Egypt,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021422&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
14:22) as is customary with the Prophets; for thus is it described by the
Psalmist, "The mountains leaped like rams, and the hills like lambs. What ailed
thee, O sea, that thou fleddest, and Jordan,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;060316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joshua
3:16) that thou wast driven back?
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
114:4, 5) For the restoration of the Church may be regarded as a renovation of
the whole world, and in consequence of this, heaven and earth are said to be
changed, as if their order were reversed. But all this depended on former
predictions, by which they had received a promise of their
return.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.

shall come up the fir-tree. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He still extols the
power of God, which would be visible in the restoration of the people; for he
shows that the change will be such that they shall have an easy road to return.
Some explain it allegorically, and suppose that by "brambles" are meant men who
wish to do injury, and who inflict wounds on others, and that these shall be
"fir-trees," that is, trees that bear fruit and that are useful to their
neighbors; but in expositions of that kind ingenuity is carried to excess. When
they say that these things relate to the kingdom of Christ, and on that account
ought to be understood in a spiritual sense, I agree with them; for the Prophet
begins with the departure from Babylon, and includes the whole condition of the
Church, till Christ was manifested to the world. But the propriety of that
allegory must not therefore be admitted; for he speaks of the departure from
Babylon, and, in order to open it up for his people, he says that he will remove
every obstacle, and will supply them with everything necessary, so that they
shall suffer no inconvenience. In like manner, when Christ promises the benefit
of redemption, he likewise takes away everything that would injure or retard,
and even turns those things to a different and totally opposite purpose, that
from them also they may receive some benefit. All things
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450828&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:28) tend to the advantage of believers, and those things which would otherwise
be injurious and destructive, are employed by God as remedies to purify them,
that they may not be devoted to the world, but may become more ready and
cheerful in the service of their Master.  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F935</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
shall be to Jehovah for a name. </i></font><font face="Palatino">When he says
that it shall be to God "for a name," he shows what is the design of the
restoration of the Church. It is, that the name of God may be more illustrious
among men, and that the remembrance of him may flourish and be maintained. On
this account he adds that it shall be a perpetual sign, that is, a monument,
and, as we commonly say, a memorial; and although, amidst these tempests, the
Church be tossed and agitated in various ways, yet, because the Lord wishes that
the remembrance of his name may be everlasting, he will guard and defend
her.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith Jehovah.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">This is a remarkable passage, in which the
Prophet shows what God demands from us, as soon as he holds out tokens of his
favor, or promises that he will be ready to be reconciled to us, that our
reconciliation may be secured. He demands from us such a conversion as shall
change our minds and hearts, that they may forsake the world and rise towards
heaven; and next he likewise calls for the fruits of
repentance.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Keep ye judgment,
and do righteousness. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Under the names
"judgment" and "righteousness," he includes all the duties which men owe to each
other, and which consist not only in abstaining from doing wrong, but also in
rendering assistance to our neighbors. And this is the sum of the second table
of the Law, in keeping which we give proof of our piety, if we have any. For
this reason the prophets always draw our attention to that table; because by
means of it our real character is better known, and true uprightness is
ascertained; for hypocrites, as we have formerly seen, 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F936</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
often practice deceit by
ceremonies.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For my salvation
is near, and my righteousness. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He assigns the
reason, and at the same time points out the source and the cause why it is the
duty of all to devote themselves to newness of life. It is because "the
righteousness of the Lord approaches to us," that we, on our part, ought to draw
near to him. The Lord calls himself "righteous," and declares that this is "his
righteousness," not because he keeps it shut up in himself, but because he pours
it out on men. In like manner he calls it "his salvation," by which he delivers
men from destruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Although this discourse
was addressed to the Jews, that, by sincere affection of heart, and by the
practice of integrity, they might show their gratitude to God their Redeemer,
yet it refers to every one of us; for the whole world is ruined in itself, if it
do not obtain salvation from God alone. We must therefore attend to this
exhortation, which instructs us that the nearer we are to God, so much the more
powerfully ought we to be excited to the practice of godliness. Hence also Paul
admonishes believers, 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F937</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
"Cast. away the works of darkness; put on the armor of light; for our salvation
is nearer than we thought."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451311&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
13:11, 12)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Happy is the man that shall
do this. </i></font><font face="Palatino">When he calls those persons "happy"
who, having embraced this doctrine, devote themselves to walk uprightly, he
indirectly leads us to conclude that many will be deaf or disobedient; but, lest
their wickedness or indifference should retard the elect, he recommends the
exhortation which he has given from the advantage which it yields. Thus, in
order that believers may abandon all delay, he exclaims that they are "happy" to
whom it hath been given 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F938</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to possess such
wisdom.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Keeping the Sabbath.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">We have said that the words "justice" and
"judgment," in the preceding verse, include all the duties of the second table;
but here he mentions the Sabbath, which belongs to the first table. I reply, as
I have already mentioned briefly, that they who live inoffensively and justly
with their neighbors, testify that they serve God; and therefore we need not
wonder that the Prophet, after having glanced at the second table, mentions also
the first; for both ought to be joined together In a word, Isaiah declares that
he who shall obey God by keeping his law perfectly shall be "happy;" for the
salvation and the righteousness of God shall belong to him. Since, therefore,
men wander at random amidst their contrivances, and adopt various methods of
worshipping God, he shows that there is only one way, that is, when men endeavor
to frame and regulate their life by the injunction of the Law; for otherwise
they will weary themselves in vain by taking other roads. In short, this is a
remarkable passage, showing that nothing pleases God but keeping the
Law.</font><br><font face="Palatino">If the question be put, "Can men obtain
righteousness and salvation by their own works?" the reply will be easy; for the
Lord does not offer salvation to us, as if he had been anticipated by our
merits, (for, on the contrary, we are anticipated by him,) but offers himself
freely to us, and only demands that we, on our part, draw near to him. Since
therefore he willingly invites us, since he offers righteousness through free
grace, we must make every effort not to be deprived of so great a
benefit.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Again, because the Sabbath, as Moses
declares,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;023113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
31:13, 17) and as
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;262012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
20:12 repeats, was the most important symbol of the worship of God, so by that
figure of speech in which a part is taken for the whole, and which is called a
<i>synecdoche</i>, the Sabbath includes all the exercises of religion. But we
must view the Sabbath in connection with everything that attends it; for God
does not rest satisfied with outward ceremony, or delight in our indolence, but
demands from us earnest self-denial, that we may be entirely devoted to his
service.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So that he may not
profane it. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This clause is commonly rendered,
"That he may not profane it; " and literally it runs thus, "From profaning it; "
and therefore we have thought it proper to prefix the word <i>"so" </i>to the
clause, "So that he may not profane it," in order to remove all
ambiguity.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And keeping his
hand, that he may abstain from all that is evil.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He now adds another <i>synecdoche</i>, to
describe the duties which men owe to each other. The amount of it is, that there
is no other way of serving God aright but by sincere piety and a blameless life,
as he has also included in these two parts the rule of leading a holy life. In a
word, it is an exposition of true righteousness which is contained in the Law of
the Lord, that we may acquiesce in it; for in vain do men seek any other road to
perfection. Here also are thrown down all false worship and superstitions, and,
finally, everything that is contrived by men in opposition to the word of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.

</i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet shows that this grace of God shall
be such that even they who formerly were estranged from him, and against whom
the door might be said to have been shut, may obtain a new condition, or may be
perfectly restored. And he meets their complaint, that they may not say that
they are rejected, or unworthy, or "foreigners," or excluded by any mark; for
the Lord will remove every obstacle. This may refer both to Jews, who had been
brought into a condition similar to that of foreign nations by a temporary
rejection, and to the heathen nations themselves. For my own part, I willingly
extend it to both, that it may agree with the prediction of
Hosea,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"I will call them my
people who were not my people."

1:10)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Joined to Jehovah.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">When he says that they are "joined to God," he
gives warning that this consolation belongs to those only who have followed God
when he called them; for there are many "eunuchs" on whom God does not bestow
his favor, and many "foreigners" who do not join themselves to the people of
God. This promise is therefore limited to those who have been called and have
obeyed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By calling them "foreigners" and
"eunuchs," he describes under both classes all who appear to be unworthy of
being reckoned by God in the number of his people; for God had separated for
himself a peculiar people, and had afterwards driven them out of his
inheritance. The Gentiles were entirely shut out from his kingdom, as is
sufficiently evident from the whole of Scripture. Paul
says,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Ye were aliens from the
commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no
hope, and without God in the world. But now by Christ Jesus, ye who formerly
were far off have been made nigh by the blood of
Christ."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ephesians
2:12, 13)</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Gentiles, therefore, might at
first doubt whether or not the benefit of adoption, which was literally intended
for the Jews, belonged to them. We see also how much the Apostles shrunk from
it, when the Lord commanded them
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;411615&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
16:15) to "preach the Gospel through the whole world;" for they thought that the
doctrine of salvation was profaned if it was communicated indiscriminately to
Gentiles as well as to Jews. The same hesitation might harass the elect people,
from the time that their banishment from the holy land became a sign of the
rejection of them; and therefore the Prophet commands them to dismiss their
doubts.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And let not the eunuch
say. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By the same figure of speech, in which a
part is taken for the whole, he includes under this designation all who bore any
mark of disgrace which kept them apart~ from the people of God; for "eunuchs,"
and those who had no children, appeared to be rejected by God and shut out from
the promise which the Lord had made to Abraham, that "his seed should be as the
stars of heaven,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011505&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
15:5) and as the sand of the sea."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
22:17) In a word, he warns all men against looking at themselves, that they may
fix their minds exclusively on God's calling, and may thus imitate the faith of
Abraham,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
15:6) who did not look at either his own decayed body or the barren womb of
Sarah, so as through unbelief to dispute with himself about the power of God,
but hoped above all hope.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450418&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
4:18-20) The Prophet addresses persons who were despised and reproached; for, as
Peter says,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"there is no respect of
persons with God, but in every nation he who feareth him, and worketh
righteousness, is accepted by him."

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thus saith Jehovah.

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F940</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

Church. He appears to annihilate in this manner all the external marks  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F941</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in which alone the Jews gloried; for the high rank of the Church is not
external, but spiritual; and although believers have no emblems of distinction
in the eyes of the world, and are even despised and reproached, yet they rank
high in the sight of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">With the "keeping of the Sabbath," he connects
obedience and adherence to "the covenant;" and hence we may readily infer that,
when he spoke hitherto about the Sabbath, he had in view not an idle ceremony
but perfect holiness. At the same time, he again lays a restraint on the
children of God, not to make even the smallest departure from the injunction of
the Law; for they are permitted to "choose," not whatever they think fit, but
that which God declares to be pleasing and acceptable to himself. Wherefore both
hypocrisy and inconsiderate zeal are here condemned, when God not only contrasts
his own commandments with the inventions of men, but enjoins them earnestly to
"take hold of his covenant."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5. </b>I will
give to them in my house. Here we see that all men, however unworthy, may obtain
admission into the kingdom of God. he alludes to Jerusalem, and to the temple in
which the Lord placed a memorial of his name. No place was given in it to any
but to the Jews alone; and they would have reckoned the temple to be polluted,
if any of the Gentiles had entered into it. Hence also a serious insurrection
arose against Paul for having brought into the temple uncircumcised persons. The
Lord now admits, without distinction, those whom he previously forbade; and
indeed he set aside this distinction, when we, who were the children of
strangers, were brought by him into the temple, that is, into his Church, which
is not confined, as formerly, within those narrow limits of Judea, but is
extended through the whole
world.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A place and a name.
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dy</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>(yad) </i>is here put for place, as in many other passages. It might also be
supposed to denote "authority," or "power; " for they shall be elevated to such
dignity as to be accounted the children of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Better than of sons and
of daughters. </i></font><font face="Palatino">A question may arise, Does the
Lord compare the Jews who were at that time in the Church, with the believers
whom he shall afterwards place in their room; or, does he contrast the future
condition of the people with their condition at that time? For it is certain
that "the name" of the Gentiles is "better" than that of the Jews, who were "cut
off on account of their unbelief; " and we have succeeded in their room, "as
wild olives ingrafted into a good olive tree," as Paul says.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451124&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:24) The meaning' might therefore be, that "eunuchs" and "foreigners" shall
have "a better name" than children and domestics, who were regarded as God's
heritage. But I choose rather to explain it in a different manner, namely, that
the dignity of believers shall be higher under Christ than it was under the Law.
The patriarchs had a very excellent "name," when they called upon God as their
Father, and were joined in covenant with him; but the grace of God has been far
more abundantly poured out upon us since the coming of Christ; and therefore we
have obtained in him a far more excellent
name.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A perpetual name.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He calls this name "perpetual," because it is
written in heaven, where it shall live and flourish throughout all ages. Wicked
men wish to have their name made illustrious in this world, and labor to promote
their reputation, that the remembrance of their name may last for ever; but it
is fading and of short duration. But far different is this name; for it makes us
heirs of the heavenly kingdom, so that in the presence of angels we are reckoned
to be the children of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We might also
interpret
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ynbm</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>mibbanim</i>) to mean, "than the name which is derived from children;

promises that this name shall be far more excellent. But I prefer to follow the
former exposition.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The children of the foreigner
who shall be joined to Jehovah. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He repeats the
same thing which he had formerly said, that God will open the doors of his
temple to all men without distinction, so that there shall no longer be a
distinction between the Jew and the Greek. He declares that those whom God
brings into a state of friendship with himself by the word, which is the bond of
our adoption, are "joined to God." This is "the betrothing in mercy and
faithfulness" which is mentioned by Hosea.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;280219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
2:19, 20) Not only does he grant to them a temple in which they may adore him as
the body of the people were wont to do, but he assigns to them a more honorable
rank, that they, nay minister to him; that is, God acknowledges as priests or
Levites those who were formerly
heathens.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And that they may
love the name of Jehovah. </i></font><font face="Palatino">We must observe the
end of the calling, which is here stated; for he says that they shall be God's
ministers on condition that they love his name. Thus hypocrites are here
excluded; for the calling joins two things together, that we serve God, and that
our service be with a ready and cheerful disposition of mind. There can be no
worship of God, if we do not willingly and readily yield obedience. What is said
about alms, that "God loveth a cheerful giver,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470907&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 9:7) ought to be applied to every part of life, that we render to
God willing service.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whosoever
shall keep my Sabbath. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He again mentions the
Sabbath; and we have said that under this word is included the whole worship of
God. In observing it the people overlooked that which was of the highest
importance; for, by resting satisfied with outward ceremony, they neglected the
truth, that is, reformation of life. The Lord enjoined them to rest in such a
manner as to keep both their hands and their minds from all crime and
wickedness.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And shall embrace
my covenant. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Here he describes the zeal and
steadfastness of those who submit themselves to God and cleave to his word; and
therefore, if we are joined to God by a covenant, we ought to hold by it
constantly, and adhere firmly to sound doctrine, so that it may not be possible
to withdraw or separate us from him in any
manner.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These will I bring.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">By these modes of expression he describes what
he had formerly stated, that foreigners who were formerly excluded from the
Church of God, are called to it; so that henceforth the distinction between
circumcision and uncircumcision shall be abolished. This cannot refer to
proselytes, who were received into the number of God's people by circumcision,
for that would have been nothing new or uncommon; but he testifies that the
grace of God shall be diffused throughout the whole world; and this cannot be
accomplished without uniting the Gentiles to the Jews so as to form one body,
which happened when the difference between circumcision and uncircumcision was
taken out of the way. There is therefore nothing now to prevent Gentiles from
ministering to God, seeing that they have been called into the temple, that is,
into the assembly of believers. Not only so, but we saw a little before, that
the priesthood is removed from the tribe of Levi, not only to the whole body of
the people, but even to foreigners.</font><br><font face="Palatino">How strongly
the Jews abhor this sentiment is well known; for, although they read these words
of the Prophet, yet they reckon it to be utterly monstrous that the Gentiles
should be called to this distinguished benefit of God which was especially
intended for them. Yet the Prophet's meaning is so plain, that it cannot without
the greatest impudence be called in question. He extols this grace from the
fruit which it yields; for true and perfect happiness is, to be reconciled to
God and to enjoy his favor. We know, indeed, that wicked men indulge excessively
in mirth; but that mirth is turned into gnashing of teeth, because the curse of
God rests upon it. But God fills the hearts of believers with the most
delightful joy, not only by showing that he is reconciled to them, but by the
manifestation of his favor and kindness in their prosperity. Yet their highest
joy is that which springs from "peace" of conscience, which Paul ascribes to
"the kingdom of God,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
14:1-7) and which we enjoy when we are reconciled to God by Christ.

5:1)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their burnt-offerings and
sacrifices shall be acceptable. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He promises
that their sacrifices shall be acceptable to him, because all have been called
on this condition, that they shall offer themselves and all that they have to
God. By the word "sacrifices," he means such spiritual worship of God as is
enjoined in the Gospel; for the Prophet spoke in accordance with what was
customary in his time, when the worship of God was wrapped up in a variety of
ceremonies. But now, instead of sacrifices, we offer to God praises,
thanksgivings, good works, and finally ourselves. When he declares that they
shall be acceptable, let us not imagine that; this arises from their own value
or excellence, but from God's undeserved kindness; for he might justly reject
them, if he looked at them in themselves. This ought to be a spur to excite in
us a strong desire to worship God, when we see that our works, which are of no
value, are accepted by God as if they had been pure
sacrifices.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On my altar;
</i></font><font face="Palatino">because in no other manner could the sacrifices
be acceptable to God than "on the altar," by which "they were sanctified."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402319&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew

Christ, who is our altar.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For

9:4) Thus by an extraordinary privilege, such as the rest of the nations were
not permitted to enjoy, a temple was built among them. But now the distinction
has been removed, and all men, to whatsoever nation or place they belong, are
freely admitted into the temple, that is, into the house of God. This temple has
been enlarged to such a degree, that it extends to every part of the whole
world; for all nations have been called to the worship of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here we have the manifest difference
between the Law and the Gospel; for under the Law the true worship of God was
observed by one nation only, for whose sake the temple was especially dedicated
to him; but now all are freely admitted without distinction into the temple of
God, that they may worship him purely in it, that is, everywhere. We must attend
to the form of expression, which is customary and familiar to the Prophets, who
employ, as we have already said, figures that correspond to their own age, and,
under the name of "Sacrifices" and of "the Temple," describe the pure worship of
God. He paints the spiritual kingdom of Christ, under which we may everywhere
"lift up pure hands,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;540208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 2:8) and call upon God; and, as Christ saith, God is not now to be
adored in that temple, but "the true worshippers worship him in spirit and in
truth."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430424&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
4:24)</font><br><font face="Palatino">For this reason we see a fulfillment of
this plain prophecy, namely, that "to all peoples the house of God hath become
the house of prayer," that all may "call upon him, Abba, Father,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans

4:6) that is, in every language; that henceforth the Jews may not boast that
they alone have God. Thus the prophets were under a necessity of accommodating
their discourse to their own time, and to the ordinary services of religion,
that they might be understood by all; for the time of full revelation was not
yet come, but the worship of God was clothed with various figures. Yet
undoubtedly the temple, which had been consecrated to the name of God, was
actually his house; for he testified by Moses that he would be in all places
where he made mention of his name,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;022024&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
20:24) and Solomon, at the dedication of the temple, said, "When they shall come
to pray in this house, thou wilt hear in heaven, in thy habitation."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;110830&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1

house into a den of robbers,"

21:13;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;411117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240711&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
7:11</font><br><font face="Palatino">Christ calls the temple "the house of
prayer," with reference to that time when the Gospel had not yet been published;
for although he was come, he was not yet known, and the ceremonies of the Law
were not abolished. But when "the vail of the temple was rent,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402751&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
27:51) and pardon of sins was proclaimed, these applauses of the temple ceased
along with other ceremonies; for God began to be everywhere called upon by "all
peoples."</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet it must here be observed that we
are called into the Church, in order that we may call on God; for in vain do
they boast who neglect prayer and true calling upon God, and yet hold a place in
the Church. In whatever place we are, therefore, let us not neglect this
exercise of faith; for we learn from the words of Isaiah, as it is also said,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;195014&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
50:14) that this is the highest and most excellent sacrifice which God demands;
so that the holiness of the temple consists in prayers being there offered
continually.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord Jehovah saith.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Isaiah again confirms what he formerly
testified as to the restoration of the people; for although he extolled in lofty
terms the grace of God, by which he would deliver his people, yet the condition
of the Church was such that promises of this kind appeared to be ridiculous.
Such repetitions, therefore, are not superfluous, but were necessarily added in
order to strengthen feeble minds, that they might be fully convinced of that
which was otherwise
incredible.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who gathereth the
outcasts of Israel. </i></font><font face="Palatino">It is with reference to the
subject in hand that he bestows on God this title; for it belongs to him to
gather a scattered church, and the same words, "he gathereth the outcasts of
Israel," are used here in the same sense.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19E702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
147:2) Thus he promises that he will assemble them, and not them only, but that
he will add to them various "peoples," that the Church may be very numerously
increased and multiplied. Whenever therefore we are drawn by various calamities
of the Church to doubt as to his gathering them together, we ought to interpose
this shield: "It belongeth to the Lord to gather the dispersed of Israel; and,
though they are widely dispersed and scattered, yet he will easily and perfectly
restore them."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Still more will
I gather upon him his gathered. </i></font><font face="Palatino">I willingly
keep by the literal meaning of the words of the Prophet.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">L[</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>(gnal) </i>that is, "To,' or "Upon; " for he appears to me to have in view
what he had said in the former verse, that the temple would be opened to all
peoples; and he means that he will yet add many others to the Jews who have been
gathered. This actually happened; for not only did he gather the dispersed in
Babylon, but he also gathered other dispersions, which were frequent and almost
of daily occurrence. Nor has he ever ceased to gather; so that he has added a
large mass to those who have been
gathered.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All ye beasts of the field.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">This prediction appears to be at variance with
what goes before; for what the Prophet has hitherto said was full of the most
delightful consolation, but now he appears to threaten fiercely, and to predict
frightful ruin. These statements might indeed appear to be contradictory; but,
after having comforted believers, it ought not to be thought inconsistent if he
forewarn them of a future calamity that they might not lose courage when they
saw everything near destruction, and that necessity might likewise prompt them
to betake themselves more warmly and earnestly to the grace of God. There is
also another reason, that hypocrites abuse the promises of God and hold them out
under false pretenses, cherish unfounded hope, and insolently boast of those
things which do not at all belong to them; and therefore Isaiah intended to take
from them the ground of false boasting.</font><br><font face="Palatino">And thus
his design was twofold; first, that the hearts of believers might not be
discouraged by various calamities, which should bring them almost, to utter
destruction, and that even when, amidst prosperity and peace, they beheld by
faith at a distance a future calamity, they might rest satisfied with this
single consolation; and secondly, that he might strike hypocrites with dread and
horror, so that they might not exalt themselves by vain confidence, or freely
indulge their sinful inclinations under the pretense of these promises. For this
reason God calls not men, but savage "beasts," that they might devour the
people. He therefore forbids believers to be alarmed and tempted to unbelief,
when these wild beasts shall be sent. And yet he intended also to strike terror
into them, that he might arouse them to repentance, and to exhort them to seek
the mercy of God, that the promises might not lose their
value.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he calls them "beasts <i>of the
field</i>," he means beasts of every kind, and includes not only the Babylonians
and Assyrians, but Antiochus, the Romans, and other enemies of the people, who
brought various calamities upon them. But he has chiefly in view the defeat
which they received from the Babylonians, who carried them away into wretched
bondage.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Her watchmen are blind.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He now assigns the reason why the people must
be destroyed. It is because they are governed by wicked princes and pastors; not
that he wishes to throw the blame on them alone, and thinks that the people are
innocent, but because this was the beginning of the evil. We are not exempted
from blame, if we follow blind guides, but, on the contrary, are justly punished
for our transgressions; for the Lord takes away good guides from those whom he
intends to punish for their ingratitude.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By the
word "Watchmen"  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F943</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he means not only the prophets, to whom was committed the office of teaching,
but likewise judges, princes, and kings, who ought to have governed everything
in a proper manner. He includes both kinds of government, that of princes, and
that of the ministers of the word, whom the Lord has placed, as the two eyes in
the body, to govern the Church. Consequently, if they are wicked or unfaithful,
there cannot arise a more destructive plague to a
commonwealth.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All are
ignorant. </i></font><font face="Palatino">First, he reproaches them with want
of knowledge; for, as it is the chief excellence of a good shepherd to know his
duty, that he may judge what is profitable and what is pernicious to the flock,
and to watch laboriously, and to stand, as it were, on a watch-tower, that he
may promote their safety in every respect, so nothing is more inconsistent with
that office than ignorance and blindness. No man, therefore, will be a good
shepherd, unless he understands the right method of governing the people. And
hence we see what we ought to think of the idols of our time, who haughtily and
insolently boast of the name of shepherds or pastors; for they are untaught and
ignorant beasts.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All are dumb
dogs. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By calling them, secondly, "dumb dogs,"
he charges them with slothfulness and indifference; for, since it is the duty of
a good shepherd to be industrious and careful, when he calls them slothful and
indifferent, he shows that they had nothing about them that ought to belong to a
shepherd. Thus, when we are deprived of good shepherds, and when lazy or even
savage beasts come in their room, let us acknowledge God's wrath, and let us
know that destruction is not far off; for the Prophet threatens and foretells
the ruin of the people, when shepherds are
"dumb."</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence also it follows, that God appoints
them to discharge the office of "dogs," that is, to keep watch, to drive away
robbers and thieves, and not to permit them to enter into the fold. And if dogs
are so faithful guardians and so warmly attached to their masters, that they
continually watch for their safety, and do not cease to drive away, by barking,
those from whom danger is apprehended, shepherds, when they give themselves up
to sloth and drowsiness, ought to be ashamed of being surpassed by a brute
beast.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And those dogs strong of
appetite. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The third vice which he remarks in
wicked pastors is insatiable avarice. Though they are lazy in all that relates
to good government, yet they have a strong and ravenous appetite for food. Some
view the Prophet's words as still more extensive, and as meaning that they rule
tyrannically. Ezekiel expressly reproves them for this vice; for false prophets
are commonly fierce, and act cruelly and barbarously towards the people of God.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;263404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
34:4) But if any person examine the matter carefully, he will perceive that the
Prophet speaks of their insatiable avarice, which he afterwards describes by a
variety of expressions.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
look to their ways. </i></font><font face="Palatino">That is, "They attend
eagerly to their own affairs; every person consults his own advantage." In
short, he means that there is no man who does not wish to be preferred to
others, as if every man had been born for
himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every one to his gain
from his end.</i> </font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F944</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">whxqm</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>mikkatzehu</i>) has received various expositions. Some render it, "In his
end," that is, "In his affairs;" as if the reading had been,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">whxqb</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>bekatzehu</i>) But this does not agree with the Prophet's meaning. Others
render it, "From the end of his avarice." I think that a more simple
interpretation is, "From his end," that is, "On his part; " or as we commonly
say, (<i>Chacun en son endroict</i>,) "Every one in his place." Thus every one
is bent on avarice, and draws and appropriates everything to himself, and
consults his own advantage, without attending to the duties of his
office.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we learn, that no man can serve
God who is given up to wicked desires; and he who shall labor to amass wealth,
will not apply his mind to build up the Church of the Lord. No kind of blindness
can be more dangerous than avarice; and so much the more ought it to be avoided
by pastors, if they wish to be faithful servants of God. When we see the Prophet
complaining of the bad pastors of his time, let us not be alarmed if we meet
with the same thing in the present day, and let us not look upon it as an
unusual occurrence that so few are earnestly employed in the work of the
Lord.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come ye, I will fetch wine.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">After having spoken of the avarice and
carelessness of pastors, he points out their desperate wickedness and obstinacy;
for he represents them as speaking, 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F945</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and brings forward their hard-hearted speeches, from which it is evident that
they could not be brought back to the right path by any admonitions or
threatenings, but fearlessly despised them all. In another passage the Prophet
quoted the words of scorners, who, when the servants of God exhorted them to
sackcloth and ashes, invited each other to feasting and drinking. "Let us eat
and drink; for tomorrow we shall die."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;232213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
22:13) Why do those prophets annoy us? It will never fare well with us, if we
give ear to them.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;232815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
28:15) A similar complaint is here repeated by Isaiah, that the pastors held out
obstinately and seared themselves against the judgments of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Nor does he merely reprove them for
drinking <i>wine and strong drink</i>, which in itself is not sinful, but for
that mental drunkenness and brutality by which men haughtily and insolently
despise the word of God. In other passages drunkenness and the abuse of wine are
condemned; but here the Prophet exclaims against the madness and insolence with
which pastors exalted themselves against God, and trampled under foot all
threatenings, warnings, reproofs, and, in short, all religion. Yet there can be
no doubt that he reproves the gross and shameful wickedness of burying
reflection, as if on purpose, by excess of wine and feasting, that no shame or
fear, no reverence for God or men, might disturb their repose; as ungodly
persons do all they can to stupefy themselves by unlawful pleasures, that they
may more daringly, and with less reserve, abandon themselves to
wickedness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is a shocking and monstrous sight
to behold such contempt of God and of religion, not in foreigners, not in the
common people, but in governors and princes themselves, who ought to have
instructed others by their example, in that sacred order which bore the image of
Christ; for both kings and priests bore his likeness and image. How intolerable
this pride is, by which men furiously oppose the word, is well known. We are
ruined and undone, when this medicine, which is the last, is rejected by us; for
we do not permit the Lord to lead us back into the right path. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F946</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For this reason he has threatened in another passage that "this wickedness shall
not be expiated."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;232214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
22:14) Thus he rebukes the height of impiety; and it is of great importance for
us to weigh carefully the words which follow
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As today, so tomorrow.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">That is, "If it is well with us today, it shall
be well tomorrow. Let us not be miserable before the time."  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F947</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He describes their aggravated guilt, in treating with mockery God's gentleness
and forbearance, and assuring themselves that they would escape punishment, as
if God were asleep or enjoyed luxurious ease in heaven, whenever he suspended
his judgments. By such diabolical proverbs, do men, even in the present day,
labor to soothe and even to fascinate their consciences, that they may more
fully wallow in every kind of pleasures, and indulge in their iniquities and
crimes. That we may not fall, therefore, under this terrible judgment of the
Lord, let every one examine himself, and perceive at a distance the wrath of
God, that it may not attack us suddenly and unprepared.</font><br></div>

event of his providence, more remarkable than all others, that he takes away
good and worthy men out of this life, when he determines to chastise his people
severely. But no man considers it, or reflects that it is a token of approaching
destruction, that God gathers them, and places them in safety from being
distressed by prevailing afflictions. The general meaning is, that wicked men
grievously deceive themselves by supposing that there is no greater happiness
than to have life continued to a great age, and by thus pluming themselves on
their superiority to the servants of God, who die early. Being attached to the
world, they likewise harden themselves by this pretense, that, by nothing else
than a manifestation of God's favor towards them, while others die, they
continue to be safe and
sound.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Men of mercy are
gathered. </i></font><font face="Palatino">If by "men of mercy" be meant kind or
tender-hearted men, this description ought to be carefully studied, by which the
Prophet shows what is the true righteousness of the children of God; for
hypocrites reckon this to be of no value. But nothing is more acceptable to God
than kindness, by which we give evidence of our righteousness, and manifest that
our heart is free from all hypocrisy. Yet we may with equal propriety take the
phrase "men of mercy" in a passive sense, as meaning those whom the Lord has
embraced by his mercy; for it is a phrase of frequent occurrence in Hebrew
writings. Nor will it be inappropriate to suppose that there is an implied
contrast between the grace of God and the wicked and unfavorable judgments of
men; for they are wont to look on those persons as condemned who are taken away
in the flower of their age. But, since God, in many passages of Scripture,
represents gentleness and kindness as a distinguishing mark of his children,
this may be, as I have said, a definition of true
righteousness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we see that the Lord, at
that time, gathered many good men, whose death portended some dreadful calamity,
and yet that the Jews paid no regard to such forewarnings, and even proceeded to
more daring lengths of wickedness; for they thought that all went well with
them, when they were the survivors of many excellent men. This doctrine is
highly appropriate to every age. It frequently happens that God takes good men
out of this world, when he intends to punish severely the iniquities of the
ungodly; for the Lord, having a peculiar regard to his own people, takes
compassion upon them, and, as it were, snatches them from the burning, that even
survivors may perceive in it the wrath of God. And yet this is not an invariable
rule; for righteous men are frequently involved, along with the reprobate, in
temporal punishments; but it is so frequent that it rarely happens otherwise. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F948</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">In
our own times a remarkable instance of this was given in the death of Luther,
who was snatched from the world a short time before that terrible calamity
befell Germany, which he had foretold many years before, when he exclaimed
loudly against that contempt of the Gospel, and that wickedness and
licentiousness which everywhere prevailed. Frequently had he entreated the Lord.
to call him out of this life before he beheld that dreadful punishment, the
anticipation of which filled him with trembling and horror. And he obtained it
from the Lord. Soon after his death, lo, a sudden and unforeseen war sprang up,
by which Germany was terribly afflicted, when nothing was farther from her
thoughts than the dread of such a
calamity.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Instances of this kind occur every
day; and if men observed them, they would not so heedlessly flatter themselves
and their vices. But I thought it right to take special notice of this event,
both because it happened lately, 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F949</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and because in so distinguished a preacher of the Gospel and prophet of God it
must be more clearly seen. We ought, therefore, to consider diligently the
worlds of the Lord, both in the life and in the death of "the righteous," but
especially in their death, by which the Lord calls them away to a better life,
that they may be rescued from those afflictions in which the wicked must be
plunged.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Peace shall come.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet describes what shall be the
condition of believers in death; for the wicked, who think that there is no life
but the present, imagine that good men have perished; because in death they see
nothing but ruin. For this reason he says that "Peace shall come," which is more
desirable than a thousand lives full of trouble; as if he compared them to
discharged soldiers, who are and allowed to enjoy case and
quietness.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall rest in
their beds. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He adds the metaphor of sleep, in
order to show that they shall be absolutely free from all the uneasiness of
cares, just as if they were safely pleasantly asleep "on their
beds."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whosoever walketh
before him. </i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F950</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
I do not think that the verb "walketh" is connected with
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;wl&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>shalom</i>,) "peace," as some do, who suppose the meaning to be this, that
peace shall go before believers, so as to be, as it were, the guide of their
life. But I am of opinion that believers, on the contrary, are described by it;
as if he had said, "Whosoever walketh before God shall enjoy peace." Thus, when
righteous men die, and their various labors are finished, and their course is
ended, they are called to peace and repose. They "rest in their beds," because
they do not yet enjoy perfect blessedness and glory; but they wail; for the last
day of the resurrection, when everything shall be perfectly restored; and that,
I think, is what Isaiah meant.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It will be said,
"Do not righteous men enjoy this peace while they live?" for the fruit of faith
is, that; "in patience we may possess our souls."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;422119&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
21:19) Although faith produces peace in our hearts,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450503&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
5:3) yet we are tossed about by various storms and tempests; and never in life
are we so calm and peaceful as when the Lord takes us to himself. Peaceful and
calm, therefore, is the death of the righteous,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B615&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
116:15) for it is "precious in the sight of God;" but stormy is the death of the
wicked.  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F951</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Hence also we may learn that souls are immortal; for if souls had no feeling,
(as some fanatics have dreamed,) they could not enjoy "peace." Thus they enjoy
peace and repose, because they live in
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3. </b>And draw near, ye sons of the
sorceress. After having spoken of the happy and peaceful death of good men, he
breaks out with very great vehemence against the wicked, who did not cease to
lead a base and shameful life, and were not moved by the death of believers. As
he had said that good men enjoy peace, so he threatens that the wicked shall
have ceaseless war. He taught that to the holy servants of God death shall even
be like a hiding-place, to shelter them from the whirlwind, and storm, and other
tempests, that he might threaten the worst of evils against the obstinate
despisers of God. Here we ought to observe the contrast, between good men who
walk before God, and the wicked, who cease not rebelliously to resist God. The
former shall enjoy peace when they die; the latter shall have no peace during
life, and shall feel dreadful torments in
death.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He orders them to come forth to the
judgment-seat of God, which they hope that they will be able to escape by their
disguises; and therefore he affirms that they gain nothing by their refusal, for
they shall be dragged against their will. The more hardened they were, the
sharper were the excitements that must be applied to them; and therefore the
harshness of the Prophet could not be excessive, either in arousing their
stupidity, or in casting down their pride. And indeed it is well known how
insolent was the vanity of the Jews on account of their genealogy; for which
reason the prophets frequently beat down their haughtiness and pride, and
affirmed that they were not the children of Abraham, because they were bastards
and traitors.</font><br><font face="Palatino">On this account Isaiah calls them
"the seed of the adulterous and the whore." In like manner Ezekiel reproaches
them, "Thy father is an Amorite; thy mother a Hittite."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;261603&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
16:3) Similar forms of expression are found ill many parts of Scripture. Thus he
beats down their intolerable hardihood, and drags them forward unwillingly and
reluctantly, that they might not think that they could escape the judgment-seat
of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On whom have ye made sport?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet shows that there is no reason why
the Jews should boast so proudly on the pretense of their birth, seeing that
they mocked at God and the prophets. They thought that they had to deal with
men, when they rejected the word; as we see that wicked men in the present day,
while they fearlessly despise the doctrine of God and laugh at ministers,
nevertheless shelter themselves, and falsely glory in the name of God. This is
the reason why the Prophet bears hard upon them and censures with
severity.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On whom have ye
opened the mouth? </i></font><font face="Palatino">The meaning of the words is,
"When ye put forth the tongue against God, and mock his word, do ye think that
ye have to deal with a mortal man?" The question (" On whom? ") means that they
resorted to disguises and concealments, in order to conceal their impiety; for
wicked men do not confess that they are rebels against God, and even complain
that they are very unjustly treated. But they must be dragged to the light and
convicted of their wickedness; for if there be a God in heaven, they carry on
war with him, by attacking and rejecting his word and treating it as a
fable.</font><br><font face="Palatino">To "open the mouth" and to "put forth the
tongue" mean the same thing, except that by these expressions he has more fully
described their wickedness, in not only rejecting God, but also mocking him. The
inward contempt of the heart had driven them to open jeers and blasphemies, so
that they were not moved by any fear of
disgrace.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Seed of the
adulterer and the whore. </i></font><font face="Palatino">At length he concludes
that they are treacherous children, a lying seed, and that he has justly
reproached them with being "the children of the whore;" for such contempt of God
could not be found in the children of Abraham. Hence we learn in what manner
wicked men ought to be treated, and with what severity they ought to be
reproved, that they may not flatter themselves; and the more they despise
everything that is held out in the name of God, the more ought their
sacrilegious wickedness to be exposed and dragged forth to public
view.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Inflaming yourselves.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Others render it, "Taking delight" or
"consolation;" but the Prophet makes use of a metaphor which is often found in
Scripture, and which is exceedingly adapted to the present subject; for the Lord
compares the ardor by which idolaters are hurried along to the love of a harlot,
by which poor wretched men are inflamed so as to be transported with blind
eagerness.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
3:1;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;280202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
2:2; 4:5) Idolaters have no moderation, and do not permit themselves to be
reclaimed from their madness by any arguments. In the sight of God idolatry is a
very base kind of fornication.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Under the oaks,

(<i>elim</i>) "gods," and others "oaks." 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F952</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
I leave every one at liberty to adopt either reading; for the meaning will
always be the same, and commentators are agreed that the Prophet condemns
idolatry. I do not dispute, therefore, about the reading; though it is probable
that the same thing is twice repeated, in accordance with the practice of Hebrew
writers, in a particular and in a general form, and yet that the Prophet, by
means of an ambiguous word, alludes to "the
gods."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sacrificing children.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Here he bears still harder on the Jews, and
shows that they are not the true seed of Abraham; seeing that they pollute
themselves with superstitions of every kind. In consequence of the delight which
the Jews took in such practices, he exposes their vileness. "You shelter
yourselves, indeed, under the name of religion, but I declare that you commit
fornication with idols." In this manner it was proper to expose and freely to
point out that wickedness which base and malicious men endeavor to cloak under
various pretenses; and thus the Prophet boldly discharges his duty by summoning
men to the judgment-seat of God, and holding them to be guilty, though they wish
to take every method of excusing themselves. He shows that they are treacherous,
and have departed from the law of God by abominable idolatry, and mentions one
kind of shocking and even accursed and monstrous worship; namely, the
"sacrificing of children," from which it is very evident how powerful is the
spirit of error, when men have once turned aside from God. Satan seizes their
minds
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;530209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Thessalonians 2:9) in such a manner that he drives them altogether to madness
and rage. They who do not hesitate to slay their children, as if on the ground
of its being a righteous sacrifice, must be in a state of furious
madness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">And yet those cruel murderers of their
children did not want some pretense; for they cloaked their crime under the
example of Abraham, who did. not spare
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
22:16) his only-begotten son; and the ancient Hebrew writers pronounce it to
have been
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kakozhli&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">)
a wicked imitation "If we are Abraham's descendants, we ought not to spare our
children." But Abraham did this
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
22:2) by the command of God; while they did it of their own accord, and without
God's command. It was an extraordinary example, by which the Lord intended to
try and attest Abraham's faith. Besides, Isaac was not sacrificed; for the Lord
was satisfied with Abraham's cheerful and ready will.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
22:12) They slew their children. It was, therefore, a perverse and damnable
imitation, for they differed widely from their father This should be carefully
observed; for a large portion of superstitions has proceeded from this source of
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kakozhli&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">)
wicked imitation. Men have rashly and without discrimination seized on
everything that was done by the fathers.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Amidst polished stones,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">or,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in parts of the valley.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He continues the same subject, and reproves in
various ways the superstitions which abounded in Judea; for no place was
altogether free from idolatry. There were no rocks, no rivers, no valleys, no
corner whatever, in which they had not erected a monument of their superstition.
They had their groves and mountains, in which they sacrificed after the manner
of the Gentiles.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Whether we here adopt the
reading, "Polished stones," or "Parts of the river," the meaning will be the
same. The Prophet means that the Jews chose their own method of worshipping God,
and turned aside from the rule which he had laid down in his Law; and
consequently that every kind of worship which they followed by their own choice
was abominable and wicked; for in religion and in the worship of God it is only
to the voice of God that we ought to listen. If it be thought preferable to
render it "polished stones," then Isaiah rebukes the contempt of the Law by
which God forbade the use of hammers,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;022025&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
20:25) in hewing or chiselling the stones to be employed in building the altar;
for he did not wish that sacrifices should be offered on any but one altar. But
as it was customary with the Gentiles to dedicate temples near fountains and
rivers, the other meaning will be equally
appropriate.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They, they are
thy lot. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The repetition of "they, they" is
highly emphatic. A word may be supplied by way of permission, as if the Lord
permitted the Jews to abide by their practices, since they had forsaken him and
preferred idols and false worship; as it is said, "Go, sacrifice to idols."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;262039&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
20:39) I am disposed to favor this reading; as if he had said, "I leave to you
your inventions, and willingly permit you to be entirely devoted to them, and
relinquish my right; for I have nothing to do with traitors and apostates." And
yet he undoubtedly alludes to that passage in the writings of Moses, by whose
mouth God said that he would be the inheritance of his people, so that they
ought to be satisfied with having him alone.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;041820&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
18:20) This was also followed by David, who says, "The Lord is my portion, my
inheritance."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;191605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
16:5) Since, therefore, the Jews had revolted from God, and had followed idols,
the Lord justly commanded them to keep the idols to themselves, and intimated
that he would have nothing in common with
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Even to them hast thou
poured a drink-offering. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He proceeds in
enumerating superstitions, and confirms the statement that he has been rejected
and cast off by them; for they alienated to false gods what he wished to belong
to himself alone. The Jews might have replied to every word of the Prophet, that
they had no other intention than to worship God. But the Prophet pays no regard
to such idle and frivolous pretenses; for the wrath of God is provoked by false
worship, and is the more inflamed by it in proportion as it is more constant and
longer continued. Hence we learn what sobriety we ought to observe in the
worship of God, that we may depend on his word alone; for whosoever shall swerve
from it in the smallest degree, will not only lose his labor, but will kindle
the wrath of God, whose majesty he wickedly insults and does all that is in his
power to lessen.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall I take
pleasure in these things? </i></font><font face="Palatino">It might also be
translated, "Shall I repent?" This interpretation has been most generally
adopted, because he wishes to assign a reason why he punishes the people. As if
he had said, "When I take vengeance for these transgressions, is it possible
that I shall repent? " Yet the interpretation which I have followed appears to
me preferable, "Shall I take delight, or consolation, from those sacrifices
which thou hast offered to me?" For idolaters commonly take delight in their own
inventions, and imagine that God also is delighted with everything that they
pursue with mad and furious eagerness. Nor is such a question superfluous; for
men think that God is like themselves, and will approve of everything that is
agreeable to them. On the contrary, he declares that nothing is approved by him,
or is acceptable to him, but what agrees with his word. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F953</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Upon a lofty and high
mountain. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He again repeats that metaphor at
which we have formerly glanced. Superstitious persons commit fornication with
their idols, because, by forsaking the simplicity of the word, they violate the
bond of that holy marriage into which God has entered with them, and prostitute
themselves to Satan. But now Isaiah intended to express something more; for,
when he says that they set up their bed on a lofty place, he means that they are
not at all ashamed of their shameful conduct. As a harlot, who has lost all
shame, dreads not the sight of men, and cares not about her reputation, so they
openly and shamefully committed fornication in a lofty and conspicuous place. He
compares altars and groves to "beds" on which that accursed crime is committed,
and he compares men who sacrifice on them to impudent and abandoned harlots. As
to the opinion entertained by some, that this relates to the couches on which
they reclined at their sacrificial feasts, there is no good foundation for
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To offer a sacrifice.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Here he describes without a figure that kind of
fornication which he rebukes, namely, that they offered sacrifices to idols.
They imagined, indeed, that in doing so they were rendering obedience to God;
but the Lord rejects all that men contrive according to their own pleasure, and
abhors that licentiousness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behind the door.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He dwells largely on the crime of which we have
already spoken, that the people may no longer flatter themselves in their
inventions. It is probable that Isaiah alludes to the words of Moses, by which
God commanded them to have the Law continually placed before them, to attach it
to the posts of their houses, and to keep it written and wrapped around their
arms and the fringes of their garments, that they might be constantly reminded
of their duty.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
6:9; 11:20) But the Jews, on the contrary, polluted the doors and posts of their
houses by tokens of idolatry, and left no corner free or pure from such
pollutions. Thus they came to forget everywhere God and the Law, and substituted
in their room the excitements of their own
lust.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast enlarged thy
bed</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He again repeats what he formerly said,
and returns to that clause, that the Jews most basely commit fornication with
idols when they think that they are worshipping God; because they do not follow
the rule of the word. It is the same as if a woman, having forsaken her husband,
should prostitute herself in a brothel, and freely receive all that came, as if
the bed had been a large plain, and capable of containing a vast
multitude.</font><br><font face="Palatino">For this reason he says that she was
detected by him, because, having laid aside the modesty of the married state,
she allowed herself to be dishonored and ravished by others; for God holds the
place of a husband, to whom she ought to have been subject, but she sought new
husbands, and broke the bond of marriage, he describes their aggravated guilt,
by saying that the Jews of their own accord devoted themselves to idols, as if a
base woman ran after a man with blind
eagerness.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou lovedst their
bed in the place which thou sawest. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By a
different figure he accuses them of that hasty love, because, as if by a single
glance, they were suddenly and eagerly hurried on to any place whatever. Yet he
blames the rashness of men, who think that they are sagacious in worshipping
God, and select places according to their own pleasure. But this sagacity is
diabolical; for God commands us to keep our eyes fixed on himself and his word,
so as to be closed against everything
else.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou wentest to the king
with ointment. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet censures
another vice closely allied to the former; for ungodliness begets various
errors, and leads into grievous and intricate distresses those minds which are
frivolous and destitute of the fear of God; for it is proper that they who
refuse to rest on God should be tossed about, or rather driven up and down. He
therefore reproaches the Jews with having labored much and long in seeking the
assistance of the wicked; that is, with having attempted to bring the Egyptians
against the Assyrians, and next, when they had been disappointed of their hope,
with having begun to betake themselves to the Babylonians. When their hearts
have been estranged from God, they seek assistance from another quarter, and by
great labor and expense bring upon themselves severer distresses. Yet while the
Lord grants repose to his people, that they may perform their work in peace,
wicked men "vex themselves in vain, rise early, go late to rest, eat the bread
of sorrow," as it is said,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19C702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
127:2) and yet do not gain a farthing, because all that they do is without God's
authority or guidance. But the Spirit inflicts on them this punishment, so that
they incessantly wander and are tossed about in doubt and uncertainty, and never
can find rest in their minds.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou art wearied.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He means that men undertake superfluous and
useless labors, when they do not follow God. They vex themselves in vain, as has
been already said; for nothing that is attempted in opposition to God can ever
be successful. Besides, he wittily ridicules the wicked practices of those who
choose rather to waste themselves by incessant toil than to advance calmly
wherever God calls them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
hast not said, There is no hope;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is,
"Although thou seest that thy labors are fruitless, yet thou obstinately
perseverest and pursuest thy designs; whereas even fools, when they are
unsuccessful, commonly repent." Men must therefore be obstinate and desperate,
when an unhappy and unsuccessful issue of their schemes does not sometimes lead
them to ask themselves, What are you doing? Jeremiah glances at this obstinacy,
hut in different words; for he says that the Jews were so fool-hardy as to
say,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"We are undone, yet we will
follow our own thoughts. This has been determined by us, and our opinion cannot
be changed."

in the question, "Does he speak sincerely or ironically?" If the words be taken
in the literal sense, the meaning will be, "Thou didst not grieve, because
fortune appeared to favor thee for a time." When unbelievers succeed to their
wish, they encourage themselves the more in their unbelief, and, as the common
saying is, "Men are blinded by prosperity." But especially this happens when men
have forsaken God, and abide by their own ways and schemes; for then they
fearlessly despise God. But they may also be viewed as ironical, "How comes it
that thou dost not retrace thy steps and repent? Why dost thou not acknowledge
thy folly? Is it because thou hast life in thy hand, and because everything goes
prosperously with thee? 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F955</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">I
prefer the latter interpretation, though I do not reject the former. It is plain
enough from history that the Jews had no good reason for being proud of their
prosperity or success; for the treaty into which they entered, first with the
Egyptians, next with the Assyrians, and lastly with the Babylonians, was
destructive and fatal to them; and they found by experience how rash they had
been in calling allies to their aid; so that the Prophet justly taunts them with
having found "the life of their hand." Thus he heightens his description of the
foolishness of this people, who willingly rush forward to their own destruction,
and obstinately bring down ruin on themselves, when they ought, at least, like
fools, to have gained wisdom by the misery which they had
experienced.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And whom hast thou worshipped
and feared? </i></font><font face="Palatino">Here he breaks out more vehemently
against the Jews, because they were destitute of the fear of God, though they
boasted of their holiness and sheltered themselves under an empty title of
religion. Not only do hypocrites flatter themselves in their superstitions, but
they are likewise regarded by the common people as holy and pious; and,
therefore, they act haughtily and insolently towards God and men. But the
Prophet declares that true fear of God cannot exist, where the worship is not
pure and agreeable to his word. All the opinions entertained by men, as to the
plausible forms of worship observed by superstitious persons, are absolute
wickedness and folly, he declares, therefore, that there is no fear of him and
no religion among them, although they are greatly delighted with their
masks.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What is more, by their religious
ceremonies, as manifest proofs, they show that they have no reverence or fear of
God; for God testifies, by Moses, that he makes trial whether or not they love
him with all their heart, when he permits superstition and idolatry to be
introduced by the false prophets.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
13:3) All that fly to them, therefore, show that they are altogether destitute
of the fear of God; for, if they considered that they must one day give an
account to him, they would not so daringly trample under foot his
commandments.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And hast not
remembered me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. When he complains of having been
forgotten, he shows that it was through obstinate wickedness that they fought
against God, and not through ignorance that they wandered from him; because,
having a sure rule of leading a holy life, they willingly revolted from him, and
broke the promise which they had made to him. We ought to consider diligently
how dreadful is the thunder launched against hypocrites, who mock at all
threatenings, and cover themselves by vain disguises, when he declares that they
are destitute of the fear of God, and that they are liars and have forgotten
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is it not because I held
my peace? </i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F956</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Here I have thought it right to insert the word "because," which needs to be
supplied, in order to bring out more fully the Prophet's meaning; for those who
do not supply some word subject themselves to a vast amount of trouble in
bringing out an exposition; and we know how frequently this mode of expression
is employed by the Hebrew writers. He reproaches the Jews with having abused
God's forbearance and patience, by which their hearts ought rather to have been
softened. But such is the wickedness of men, that it renders them bolder in
transgression, and leads them to think that they may do what they please without
being punished.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Accordingly, in the last clause
of the verse I consider the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>vau</i>) to mean <i>therefore. </i>"And <i>therefore </i>thou dost not fear
me, because I held my peace, whereas thou oughtest rather to have been melted by
my goodness." Hence we infer that the Jews could not complain of God's excessive
severity, since he bore patiently with them for a long time, and they grew worse
and worse in consequence of having been exempted from punishment. It was
therefore necessary that he should assume a totally different character, and
punish them more severely for their
iniquities.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will declare thy
righteousness. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet affirms that the
Lord will no longer endure what he formerly endured, and that henceforth he must
follow a different method. He calls it ironically "their righteousness; " for he
means by it all the wickedness and all the errors by which they were stained and
corrupted; as if he had said, "I will show what is the nature of your
righteousness." So long as God "holds his peace," they who are most unrighteous
and most unholy appear to be "righteous" persons; but when the Lord ascends his
judgment-seat, men are brought out of their lurking-places, and their baseness
is dragged forth to public view. And so the Prophet means that the greatest
wickedness passes in the world for "righteousness," so long as God holds his
peace, but that it shall at length be scattered, when he ascends his
judgment-seat; for men, after having much and long flattered themselves, shall
at length feel that he is their
judge.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall not
profit thee. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This relates to the effect, by
which men almost always judge; for they do not inquire whether a thing be
righteous or unrighteous, but think that whatever is profitable to them ought to
be approved. The Prophet therefore threatens that all the works from which they
hoped to derive some profit shall be destructive to
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When thou shalt cry, let thy
troops deliver thee. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He states more fully what
he had slightly touched in the former verse, that, when they shall come to close
quarters, they shall be ashamed; for the potential mood, "Let them deliver,"
amounts to saying, "They will not do it." He alludes to what he had formerly
said, (verse 9) "Thou wentest to the king with ointments." And accordingly he
gives the name of "troops" to all the means of defense by which the Jews thought
that they would be safe; for, by trusting to them, they abandoned themselves to
every kind of vices, as if they should be certain of escaping punishment,
because they were guarded and fortified on every side. But the Lord shows how
unavailing are all the troops which are assembled without his
authority.</font><br><font face="Palatino">"Cry" denotes here that calamity by
which they were to be afflicted; for, relying on their treaties and on the aid
of allies, they thought that they would enjoy profound peace, as if they had
never at any former period been deceived. But he declares that all the military
defenses which they have collected for themselves shall be of no advantage to
them whatever. Detestable and accursed is that confidence which men, having
forsaken God, place in things of this world or in human defenses.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;241705&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
17:5) Formerly he brought it as a reproach against the people, that they were
not satisfied with the gentle waters of Shiloah, and desired to have the rapid
and impetuous rivers which would at length overflow them.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230806&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
8:6) This actually happened; for the Assyrians and Egyptians, and lastly the
Babylonians, were not only unprofitable, but even ruinous, to the Jews whose
allies they were.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But he who
hopeth in me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Next follows a contrast, in which
he invites them to confidence in God, which is the remedy that ought to be
employed against all evils; as, on the other hand, all evils arise from unbelief
and distrust. As to the promise of an inheritance to those who hope in God, it
amounts to this, &#8212; " What else do you seek than to remain safe and sound,
and to have your inheritance uninjured? It is I who can do this. For who brought
you into this country? Who gave you possession of it? And yet you run after
Egypt, and seek from men assistance which will be of little avail, and disregard
my help."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall have the land
by inheritance. </i></font><font face="Palatino">I have no doubt that by the
word "inheritance" he means Judea, in which the Jews were desirous to remain in
safety; for he afterwards mentions the <i>"mountain</i> of his holiness," that
is, the mountain on which the temple was built. So, then, the Jews did not
ascribe to the Lord that which belonged to him, when they fled, not to him, but
to the Assyrians or Egyptians, for help. Hence we ought to draw a universal
doctrine, namely, that our affairs will succeed admirably, if we hope in the
Lord; and if we throw away confidence in him, we certainly need not wonder if we
waver and are tossed about in various ways.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When
he calls the mountain to which the Jews were to be brought back "the mountain of
<i>holiness,"</i> he means that life and all its comforts are not in themselves
desirable, except that we may worship God; for the end of human life is this,
that God may have a people who shall render to him purity of worship. Let our
eyes, therefore, be always fixed on the worship and service of God, if we desire
life, or deliverance, or any of the comforts of
life.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he shall say, Prepare,
prepare. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Because this promise, that they who
hoped in the Lord should possess the land, might be thought ridiculous, (for
soon afterwards they were to be driven out of it,) for the sake of believers
that still remained, there is added this second promise, by which he pledges
himself that, although they have been driven out of the land of Canaan, and
banished to a distant country, yet they shall be brought back to it. He
therefore meets a doubt which might arise, that good men might not despair
during that painful and long-continued banishment, or imagine that the promise
of God had failed of accomplishment. Some explain it to mean, that the Lord will
send true and faithful prophets, to cleanse from its scandals the Church which
had been corrupted by false prophets and wicked rulers; as he formerly showed
that from them arose the cause of her ruin; and so they think that this is a
promise of a better and happier condition. But such an interpretation is
excessively forced, and therefore I choose rather to adopt the former
interpretation, that, although for a time the Jews shall be deprived of that
land, yet they shall be restored to it by the Lord, who will order the roads to
be levelled, in order to bring them back.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This
passage agrees with that which we formerly examined,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234001&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
40:1-4) in which the Lord commanded to bring comfort to his people, to proclaim
and publish the return to Judea, and to clear the roads; for, in consequence of
their having been shut up in Babylon as in a grave, and of the length and
difficulty of the journey, and of the vast wilderness that lay between, they
could scarcely have any hope of returning to their native country. It was
therefore proper that Isaiah should not pass by this matter lightly, that they
might not dread the mountains or the sea that lay between, or any other
obstructions.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Level the road.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He addresses Cyrus and Darius, whose minds the
Lord inspired to open up the path, and grant protection to the Jews; as if he
had said, that the Lord will send ministers, who are now unknown to them, by
whose agency he will "prepare the way" and bring out the people. The apostrophe,
also, by which he directly addresses them, carries greater force than if he had
spoken in the third person. By ordering them to <i>remove the</i> <i>stumbling
blocks,</i> he shows that there is no reason why they should be terrified by the
difficulties and obstructions of the roads, which the Lord will easily "take
away," whenever he thinks
fit.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Out of the way of my
people. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The hope of return is contained in
this, that the Lord determines to bring back his people, and place them again in
the land of Canaan. Wherefore, though there were no other road, yet there must
be one, and every bar and obstacle must be removed; because the Lord hath
promised their return, and consequently is their leader in the
journey.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thus hath spoken the High
and Lofty One. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He confirms the former statement
about the restoration of the people from captivity. But this verse may be
explained in two ways; either that the Prophet meets the doubt which might
spring up in the hearts of good men, and thus compares things which are
contrasted with each other; or, that he draws an argument from the nature of
God, in order to strengthen weak minds. To explain these things more clearly, we
know, first, that our hearts are often distracted by these thoughts, that God is
actually in heaven, but that there is a great distance between him and us, and
that, he overlooks or despises human affairs, and, in a word, that he takes no
care at all about us. In order to correct this imagination, the Prophet says
that God does indeed dwell in a lofty place, but does not the less on that
account look at this world and govern it by his providence; for he is anxious
about the salvation of men, and dwells with the afflicted, and with them that
are of a broken and humble heart; as it is said, "Jehovah is high, and hath
respect to the lowly,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D806&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
138:6) and in other passages.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The other meaning
is, that the Prophet shows that God is very unlike us; for we tremble in
adversity, because we measure him by our standard, and say, "How shall the Lord
render assistance to us, who are oppressed?" Besides, men who are in distress
are commonly overlooked and despised. Thus we think that God holds us in no
estimation, because we form our ideas of him from our own nature. But we ought
to entertain very different views of him; and therefore he says, that he
"dwelleth in heaven," in order to intimate that he is not liable to human
passions; for he is like himself at all times, and never changes his purpose;
and therefore as he has once promised restoration to his people, so he will
perform it. I do not dislike this interpretation, nor do I reject the former,
which is fuller and more abundant, and agrees with other passages of Scripture,
that commonly join together those two things; that the Lord dwelleth in heaven,
and taketh care of human affairs, and especially of his children, as I stated
briefly a little before.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who
dwelleth in eternity. </i></font><font face="Palatino">We are fickle, and apply
our minds sometimes to one subject, and sometimes to another; and our hearts do
not continue to be fixed on that which we have once embraced. On this account he
distinguishes between God and men, for on him no shadow of change falls; but we
have not such steadfastness as to exercise constant care about those who need
our assistance.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I inhabit the
high and holy.
</i></font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;wdq</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>kadosh</i>) sometimes denotes the temple, but here it denotes heaven itself.
We see the reason why he calls him "the Holy One," and "the inhabitant of the
holy and lofty place." It is in order to inform us how much he differs from us,
and how unlike he is to our nature. Besides, we ought to draw from it a singular
consolation, that the Lord wishes to assist the wretched, and even chooses for
himself a habitation amongst them, that is, provided that they acknowledge their
wretchedness.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And with him who
is lowly in spirit. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Wicked men are oppressed by
various calamities, but do not cease to be fierce and haughty. It will be vain
for them to hope that God will draw near to them; 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F957</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for their hearts must be lowly and utterly cast down, if they expect to obtain
any assistance from God. Accordingly, he descends even to the lifeless, that he
may breathe new life into them and form them anew. Twice he expressly mentions
the "lowly spirit," and the "afflicted heart," that we may know that these
promises belong to those who, in their afflictions, shall not be hardhearted and
rebellious, and who, in short, shall lay aside all haughtiness and be meek and
lowly.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because not for ever will I
strive. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He continues the same doctrine; for it
was difficult to persuade them of this, seeing that during that painful
captivity they perceived that God was their enemy, and could scarcely obtain any
taste of the grace of God, by which their hearts might be encouraged or
relieved. The Prophet therefore meets this doubt, and shows that the punishments
which they shall endure will be for a short time, and that God will not always
be angry with them; that God has indeed very good reason to be angry, but yet
that he will relinquish his right, and will make abatement of that which he
might have demanded. Thus he connects the wrath of God with that moderation by
which he soothes believers, that they may not be discouraged; for, although he
draws an argument from the nature of God, yet this promise is especially
directed to the Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This sentence,
therefore, ought always to be remembered by us amidst our sorest afflictions,
lest we should think that God is our enemy, or that he will always contend with
us. When he says that God is angry, he speaks as if he made an admission, and in
accordance with the feelings of our flesh; for we cannot form any other
conception of God during our afflictions, than that he is angry with us. It is
even profitable to be moved by this feeling, that it may instruct us to
repentance; and therefore this form of expression must be viewed as referring
exclusively to our capacity, and not to
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the spirit shall be
clothed, (or, shall be concealed, or, shall fail.)
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He assigns the reason why he will not always
strive. There are various interpretations of this passage. Among others this
appears to me to be the more appropriate; that "the spirit is clothed" with the
body, as with a garment. Hence also the body is called the tabernacle, and, as
it were, the habitation of the spirit. If we adopt this signification of the
word, there will be two modes of interpreting this clause. Some explain it as
referring to the last resurrection: "the spirit shall be clothed; " that is,
after having gone out of the body, will again return to it as to its habitation.
Thus there will be an argument from the greater to the less: "I will raise up
dead bodies; why then shall I not restore you, though half-dead, to a better
life?" Another meaning, which is also adopted by some, will be simpler and
better; for the interpretation of the clause, as referring to the last
resurrection, is too remote from the context. "I surrounded the spirit with a
body;" as if he had said, "I created men, and therefore will take care of
them."</font><br><font face="Palatino">But for my own part, I think that the
Prophet rises higher; for he shows that the Lord deals so gently and kindly with
us, because he perceives how weak and feeble we are; as is also pointed out in
other passages of Scripture, such as
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A313&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
103:13, 14. "Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them
that fear him. He knoweth our condition, remembering that we are dust. The age
of man is like grass, and flourisheth as a flower in the field." The same thing
is said in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197838&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
78:38, 39. "Yet being inclined to mercy, he was gracious to their iniquity, and
did not destroy them, and often recalled his anger, and did not stir up all his
indignation, remembering that they were flesh, and a wind that passeth away and
returneth not again." Here the Prophet appears to me to mean the same thing; as
if the Lord had said, "I am unwilling to try my strength with breath or wind,
which would be as if with grass or a leaf, that shall suddenly vanish away when
they have felt the heat of the sun."
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&atilde;wf[y</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>yagnatoph</i>) is explained by some to mean "Shall fail; " which agrees very
well with this passage; for our spirit shall fail, when the Lord puts forth his
power against us. Leaving the signification of the words as somewhat doubtful,
we sufficiently understand the Prophet's design. He shows that God deals gently
with us, and acts with little severity in correcting our sins, because he takes
into account our weakness, and wishes to support and relieve
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the iniquity of his lust.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Here he complains of the obstinate wickedness
of the people, and shows that the Lord had very good reason for punishing him in
this manner; so that there can be no complaint of his immoderate cruelty.
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">W[xb</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>betzagno</i>) is translated by some "lust," and by others "covetousness." If
it be "covetousness," it will then be a figurative mode of expression, in which
a part is taken for the whole; for this is the source from which all evils
arise.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;540610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 6:10) But we may take it generally for every kind of sinful desire; for
it was on account of the various and numerous vices by which the Jews were
polluted, that the Lord was angry, and inflicted on them severe punishments. But
he expressly mentions "lust," in order to intimate that they were punished, not
because they were openly wicked, but because they were sinful in the sight of
God; for it is enough to condemn them, that God is Judge of the hearts, and
punishes not only for outward crimes, but likewise for wicked dispositions and
"lusts." At the same time he reminds them that their punishment is just, in
order that, being conscious of guilt, they may humbly pray for
pardon.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I struck him, I hid
myself. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He means that his favor was, in some
respects, withdrawn and "hidden" for a time. Now, he speaks according to the
opinion of men, because, as we have already said, we imagine that God is an
enemy, and is angry with us, when he punishes for our transgressions. And it is
necessary that we should have those views and conceptions of him, that we may
arrive at a true acknowledgment of our sins; for we should never acknowledge
them sincerely, or be distressed on account of them, if we did not reflect with
ourselves, and know that we had provoked God's wrath. But, while it is desirable
that we should be led to repentance in this manner, we must beware, on the other
hand, lest in consequence of imagining that God is hostile and unwilling to be
reconciled to us, we should be swallowed up by sorrow. The Prophet therefore
restrains these immoderate terrors, and forbids us to judge of God according to
our natural disposition; for although he chastises us, he does not cease to
cherish a father's love and affection towards those whom he has once
embraced.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But he went away.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">This is the rebelliousness which the Prophet
blames and rebukes, that the people were in no degree made better, but
persevered in their wickedness. He shows that they were desperate, because the
violent remedies which the Lord had tried could not bring them back into the
right way.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have seen his ways.
</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F958</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Here the Lord, on the contrary, magnifies his mercy, because he is gracious to
that people, though obstinate and rebellious, and anticipates them by his grace
and mercy. As if he had said, "I labored to bring back this people to repentance
by my chastisements, because they violently pursued their lusts; but they were
obstinate and untameable; all that I did was of no avail. I might justly,
indeed, have ruined him, but I choose rather to heal and preserve. This cannot
be done but by distinguished and incomparable mercy. I will therefore cease to
punish them." For these reasons Isaiah gradually magnifies the mercy of God,
whom he represents as a physician considering what remedies are best adapted for
healing this people. Now, our diseases are incurable, if the Lord do not
anticipate us by his
mercy.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And will guide him.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">No chastisements, however severe, will drive us
to repentance, if the Lord do not quicken us by his Spirit; for the consequence
will be, to render us more rebellious and hard-hearted. And so we may behold, in
the example of this people, an image of mankind; that we may clearly see what is
our rebellion and obstinacy against God, and what remedies are necessary for
curing our diseases; and that, when we are diseased and almost beyond hope, we
are healed, are brought back to the right path, and afterwards continue in it.
Hence follows
consolation:</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Restoring
comforts to him. </i></font><font face="Palatino">If piety be wanting, there can
be no faith and no consolation; for they who are not dissatisfied with
themselves on account of their vices can look for nothing but the wrath of God,
terrors and despair. It is proper, therefore, to observe the context, in which
the Prophet, after mentioning "healing," next mentions "consolation; " for they
whose diseases have been cured obtain, at the same time, that joy of heart and
that consolation of which they had been
deprived.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To his
mourners</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he appears especially to denote good
men, 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F959</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
who were few in number; as appears clearly from the complaints of the prophets,
who exclaim loudly against the stupidity which had seized the people on every
side. Thus he describes those who, amidst the universal guilt, were constrained
by sincere grief to mourn, and who not only bewailed the miseries of the people,
but deeply groaned under the burden of God's wrath, while others indulged freely
in their pleasures.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I create the fruit of the
lips. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This is an explanation of the former
statement, or of the manner in which the Lord will give consolation to this
people. It is, because he will promise and offer <i>peace </i>to them; for by
"the fruit of the lips" he means that he will cause them to hear the glad
tidings of peace, by which they shall be filled with
joy.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Peace, peace.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">I think that he speaks of the publication of
"peace," the ministry of which was committed to the prophets, and was afterwards
enjoined on the apostles and the other ministers of the Gospel; as Paul teaches
that they "are ambassadors for Christ, to reconcile men to God."

Corinthians 5:20) The repetition of the word "Peace" is intended to express not
only certainty, but also uninterrupted continuance. As if he had said, "You now
hear nothing but dreadful threatenings. The doctrine of grace and salvation is
silent, because you are incapable of it. Such is your obstinacy that I must deal
with you by threatenings and terrors. But I will one day restore the doctrine of
'peace,' and open the lips of the prophets, that they may proclaim it to
you."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To them that are far
off. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This is added, because the people who had
been carried into captivity did not think that these things belonged to them,
(because they were "far off,") but perhaps to those who were at home; for
captivity was a sort of casting off. But the Prophet foretells that, though they
are at a great distance, yet they shall be partakers of this
grace.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I heal him.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">At length he adds the end or effect, that the
Lord determines to heal the people; that is, to make them safe and sound. Hence
we infer what I remarked a little before, that all that relates to the full and
perfect happiness of the Church is absolutely the gift of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Paul appears to have glanced at this
passage, when he says that Christ</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"brought peace to them
that are near, and to them that are far off."

<div><font face="Palatino">He speaks of Gentiles and Jews; for the Jews were
"near," because God had entered into a covenant with them; but the Gentiles were
"far off," because they were strangers to that covenant. But the Prophet appears
to speak of Jews only.</font><br><font face="Palatino">I reply, Paul adheres to
the true meaning of the Prophet, if the whole be but carefully examined; for the
Jews are said, in this passage, to be "far off," because the Lord appeared to
have driven them out of his house; and in that respect they resembled the
Gentiles. Since, therefore, at the time of that casting off, there was no
difference between them and the Gentiles, Paul, by putting both, as it were, in
the same rank, justly placed them on a level with the Jews, and thus applied to
them what the Prophet had spoken about the Jews; as, in a manner not unlike, he
elsewhere applies to the Gentiles a passage in Hosea.

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the wicked.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Having formerly spoken of the "peace" which
good men shall enjoy, he threatens that the wicked, on the contrary, shall have
continual war and incessant uneasiness and distress of heart; in order that good
men may value more highly the excellent blessing of "peace," and next, that the
reprobate may know that their condition shall in no degree be improved in
consequence of that peace which is promised to the children of God. But because
the reprobate make false pretensions to the name of God, and vainly glory in it,
the Prophet shows that there is no reason why they should flatter themselves, or
advance any claim, on the ground of this promise, since they can have no share
in this peace. Nor will it avail them anything, that God, having compassion upon
his people, receives them into favor, and commands peace to be proclaimed to
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As the troubled sea.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">That metaphor of "the sea" is elegant and very
well fitted to describe the uneasiness of the wicked; for of itself "the sea is
troubled." Though it be not beaten by the wind or agitated by frightful
tempests, its billows carry on mutual war, and dash against each other with
terrible violence. In the same manner wicked men are "troubled" by inward
distress, which is deeply seated in their hearts. They are terrified and alarmed
by conscience, which is the most agonizing of all torments and the most cruel of
all executioners. The furies agitate and pursue the wicked, not with burning
torches, (as the fables run,)but with anguish of conscience and the torment of
wickedness; for every one is distressed by his own wickedness and his own alarm;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F960</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
every one is agonized and driven to madness by his own guilt; they are terrified
by their own evil thoughts and by the pangs of conscience. Most appropriately,
therefore, has the Prophet compared them to a stormy and troubled sea. Whoever
then wishes to avoid these alarms and this frightful agony of heart, let him not
reject that peace which the Lord offers to him. There can be no middle course
between them; for, if you do not lay aside sinful desires and accept of this
peace, you must unavoidably be miserably distressed and
tormented.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There is no peace to the
wicked. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He confirms the preceding statement,
namely, that in vain shall the reprobate endeavor to seek peace, for everywhere
they will meet with war. It is God who threatens war, and therefore there can be
no hope of "peace." Wicked men would indeed wish to enjoy peace, and ardently
long for it; for there is nothing which they more eagerly desire than to be at
ease, and to lull their consciences, that they may freely take their pleasures
and indulge in their vices. They drive away all thoughts about the judgment of
God, and endeavor to stupify themselves and to repose in indolence, and think
that these are the best ways and methods of obtaining peace. But they never
shall enjoy it; for, until men have been reconciled to God, conscience will
never cease to annoy and carry on war with
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Saith my God.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Thus he represents God as the only author of
peace, that he may, by this dreadful threatening, tear from the Jews their
dearest pleasures; and calls him "his God," in opposition to the vain boasting
of those who falsely boasted of his name; for they cannot acknowledge God, so
long as they reject his Prophet and his doctrine. For this reason the Prophet
boldly declares that he has received a command from God to declare perpetual war
against them.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cry with the throat.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">This chapter has been badly divided; for these
words are connected with what goes before; and therefore, if we wish to
understand the Prophet's meaning, we ought to read them as if there had been no
separation. The Prophet has testified that the people shall be punished in such
a manner as to leave some hope of peace, and next has threatened that the
wicked, who by indolent pride endeavor to escape from God, shall have continual
war. He now confirms that doctrine, and informs them that God has given him this
command, to "cry with the throat," that is, to use a common expression, (<i>a
plein gosier</i>) "at the full stretch of the
voice."</font><br><font face="Palatino">Why is this? It is to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>make known to the people their
sins</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He does not speak merely of the
stretch of the voice, but means by it that keenness and severity of language
which hypocrites especially need, as if God were throwing thunderbolts against
them from heaven; for they are delighted with their vices, if they be not
severely reproved and dragged forth to the light, or rather if they be not
violently thrown down.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Spare
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> it is a mode of expression very
frequently employed by Hebrew writers, such as, "I cry, and am not silent."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;192202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
22:2) It is equivalent to a common expression, (<i>Crie sans espargner,</i>)
"Cry without sparing." We have said that the Prophet does not speak of the mere
sound of the voice, but means a severe and harsh reproof, which is very
necessary to be sharply used towards hypocrites. For instance, if the prophets
merely spoke of the Law of the Lord, and showed what is the rule of a good and
holy life, and recommended the worship of God, and likewise reproved vices, but.
without employing any vehemence of language, what impression would they produce
on hypocrites, whose conscience is lulled in such a manner that they cannot be
aroused but by applying spurs? And so a simple manner of teaching would not be
enough, unless they were sharply attacked, and the thunderbolts of words were
launched against them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Paul also, imitating the
prophets, after having condemned all mankind, breaks out with greater vehemence
against those who made some profession of holiness and abused God's patience.
"Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the Law, and boastest in God, and
knowest his will, and approvest what is excellent, being instructed out of the
Law; and trustest that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of those
who are in darkness, an instructor of fools, a teacher of the ignorant, having
the form of knowledge and of truth by the Law. Thou therefore that teachest
another, teachest thou not thyself? Thou who preachest that men ought not to
steal, dost thou steal?
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
2:17-21) Against such persons he threatens the judgment of God and terrible
vengeance, because they have abused his goodness, and vainly boast of his
name.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Thus the Prophet, in this passage,
sharpens his pen expressly against the Jews, who gloried in the name of God, and
yet proudly rose up against him. This is the method, therefore, that ought to be
followed against hypocrites, who hold out an empty show of holiness; at least,
if we wish to discharge our duty in a proper and useful manner. As the Lord
exercised the prophets in this kind of combat, so we must be exercised in it at
the present day; so that we must not hold our peace, or give them a slight
reproof, but must exclaim against them with all our
might.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It might be objected, "If the Lord
commands his servants to reprove the sins of the people, to whom he promises
peace, he undoubtedly intended to leave to them the hope of salvation. And yet
it is certain that those words are addressed to the reprobate, against whom he
had formerly declared war." I reply, believers were at that time reduced to a
small number; for there were few who embraced the peace that was offered to
them. Accordingly, when Isaiah holds out the hope of approaching peace, he has
his eye on that little flock; when he threatens war, his aim is to terrify the
multitude, who were estranged from God and despised his warnings; for the state
of the people was such, as we have formerly seen,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230121&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:21) that scarcely any pure or sound morality
remained.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And to the house of
Jacob their iniquity. </i></font><font face="Palatino">With good reason does he
call them "the house of Jacob," when the greater part of the people were
corrupted. And we ought carefully to observe this distinction: that the prophets
sometimes address the multitude at large, and sometimes limit their discourse to
a few believers. Nor is it without witty and bitter mockery that he gives the
designations of "his people" and "children of Jacob" to those who had
degenerated from their stock and had basely revolted from the faith of the
fathers. The concession made is therefore ironical; as if he had said that there
is no privilege which hinders them from hearing what they
deserve.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yet they seek me daily.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Here he intended to take away every ground of
objection from hypocrites, who had their answers ready. "We fear, serve, and
love God, and seek him with the whole heart. Why do you rebuke us as if we were
irreligious persons; for we wish to regulate our life according to the
injunctions of the Law." To meet this objection, he affirms that they do nothing
in a pure or sincere manner, that everything is pretended and hypocritical, and
consequently is of no value before God, who demands the whole heart.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
17:1)</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is proper to observe this order which
the Prophet has followed. After having threatened war against wicked men and
hypocrites, he now rebukes them severely, and takes away the pretenses and
disguises under which they shrouded themselves. This is the manner in which
hypocrites should be treated, and dragged, as it were, out of their
lurking-places; for otherwise doctrine could produce no good effect upon them.
And not only should godly teachers observe this order, but every person ought to
apply this manner of teaching for his own use, that he may not be satisfied with
himself or flatter his vices; that he may not practice hypocrisy on himself, or
suffer himself to be deceived by the tricks of Satan. Let him therefore bring a
pure and upright heart, if he wish to profit by the doctrine of the word, and to
be acceptable to God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And wish
to know my ways. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Although Isaiah admits that
traitors and liars have some show of holiness, yet, on the other hand, by a
bitter figure of speech, he censures them, as if he had said that in their
shameful boasting there was excessive wickedness. Thus it is not simple irony,
but there is likewise added a complaint, that, while they apparently labor to
serve God, still, if any person examine them more closely, and inquire into
their whole manner of life, he will perceive that their hearts are altogether
estranged from God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They ask
of me the judgments of righteousness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F961</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Those who think that in these words hypocrites blame God, and rise up against
him, as if they would enter into controversy with him, have not understood the
Prophet's meaning. I acknowledge that he does this soon afterwards; but before
coming down to it, he tears off their mask of pretended godliness. After having
said that they "seek God daily," as if there were nothing that occupied their
thoughts more earnestly than religion, he proceeds in the same strain, and says,
that they "ask judgments," that they may serve God, and observe the rule of a
holy life, that is, by pretending to burn with zeal for religion. And indeed the
Prophet here enumerates the most important exercises of believers, which
sometimes are ostentatiously imitated by the wicked. Now, the chief point of
religion is, to inquire into the will of God, that we may regulate our life by
the rule which he has laid down for us, and to depend on his mouth. But the
children of God, in this respect, are falsely copied by hypocrites, so that they
appear to practice all that relates to the true worship of God, and sometimes to
exceed the very best of men.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore have we fasted?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He proceeds farther with the same subject, and
says that feigned and perverse worshippers of God are not only blinded by their
hypocrisy, but likewise swell with pride, so that they venture openly to murmur
at God, and to complain when he presses hard upon them, as if he had done them a
grievous injury. "Dost thou reject our services, fastings, and prayers? Why are
they not acceptable to thee? Do we not vex ourselves in vain?
"</font><br><font face="Palatino">He has admitted, as we have already said, that
hypocrites have some outward show of holiness, by which they deceive men; but
now he declares that inwardly they are also puffed up and intoxicated by pride,
while they have pretended good works, by which they think that they satisfy God,
and, on this pretense, they carry themselves high against the prophets, and
indulge in the worst vices, such as unbelief, rebellion, and obstinacy against
God, distrust, cruelty, fraud, and pillage. These are light matters in
themselves, and are easily washed away by other external exercises; for the
former are their pre-eminent merits, in which they think that the worship of God
consists, and from which they hope to obtain the pardon of all their sins. Thus
they "strain out a gnat, 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F962</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and do not scruple to swallow a whole camel."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402324&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
23:24) If such characters had been found among the Jews only, and if the world
had changed its disposition, we should have needed to seek far for examples; but
since we have experience of the same thing every day, there is no necessity for
giving ourselves much trouble about the exposition of this
passage.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This complaint may be viewed as
referring both to the word and to the hand of God. In both ways God judges
hypocrites; for he rebukes by the word, and punishes for their obstinate malice;
and therefore those words may be viewed as referring both to the chastisements
and to the preceding reproof. For my own part, I interpret it as relating to the
word, and as a rebuke to hypocrites, who boasted of their fastings, and
contrasted them with the censures of the prophets; as if they were the true
worshippers of God, and were unjustly rebuked. I differ from those who think
that the people blame God for treating them harshly during their captivity. On
the contrary, it appears to me that they complain of the prophets for rebuking
them with great sharpness and severity; for the Jews wished to be regarded as
devout and religious persons, and could not patiently endure to be condemned for
impiety and wickedness. For this reason the Prophet exposes their dispositions,
and shows that they make war with God, that they may not suppose that they have
to deal with him as a private
individual.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye find pleasure
and exact all your labors. </i></font><font face="Palatino">In the second part
of the verse he refutes, in the name of God, those virtues which hypocrites
proclaim with the sound of a trumpet. It is, because they do not nevertheless
lay aside the sinful dispositions of the flesh, or begin to deny themselves; for
he condemns them chiefly on the ground of having been devoted to their desires,
and next he enumerates particular kinds of vices. Hence we may easily infer that
their heart is not moved by any anxiety to
repent.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, for strife and
contention ye fast. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This verse ought to be
connected with the end of the preceding verse; for, having in the former clause
introduced hypocrites as complaining of the violence and harshness of the
prophets, he assigns, in the latter clause, the reason why the Lord loathes
their fasts and their other performances. It is because they do not proceed from
pure affection of heart. What the inclination of their heart is, he shows from
its fruits; for he sends them back to the duties of the second table, from which
it is easily seen what we are. Purity of heart is manifested by our living
innocently, and abstaining from all deceit and injustice. These are the marks of
pure affection, in the absence of which the Lord rejects, and even abhors, all
external worship. Wherever, on the other hand, cheating, and plunder, and
extortion prevail, it is very certain that there is no fear of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Thus he reproaches hypocrites with making
their fasts to give greater encouragement to sin, and with giving a looser rein
to their lusts. We have experience of this every day. Not only do many people
fast in order to atone for their cheating and robberies, and to plunder more
freely, but even that, during the time of the fast, they may have greater
leisure for examining their accounts, perusing documents, and calculating usury,
and contriving methods by which they may lay hold on the property of their
debtors. On that account they frequently throw this labor on Lent and on the
stated times of fasts; and, in like manner, other notable hypocrites hear many
Masses every day, that they may more freely, and with less interruption, and
under the pretense of religion, contrive their cheating and
treachery.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fast not, as ye do
this day. </i></font><font face="Palatino">At length he rejects their fasts,
however highly they may value them; because in this manner the wrath of God is
still more provoked. Immediately afterwards he rejects also their
prayers.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That ye may make your
voice to be heard on high.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F963</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Hence it is evident, (as we have explained fully in our exposition of
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230111&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:11,) that God approves of no duties which are not accompanied by sincere
uprightness of heart. Certainly no sacrifice is more excellent than calling upon
God; and yet we see how all prayers are stained and polluted by impurity of
heart. Besides, in consequence of fasting being usually joined to prayer, the
Prophet takes this for granted; for it is an appendage to prayer, he therefore
forbids such men to offer up solemn prayer accompanied by fasting; because they
will gain nothing, except that the Lord will punish them more severely. And
hence we infer (as has been already said) that the Lord pays no regard to
external works, if they be not preceded by sincere fear of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Such fasting as was customary among the
Jews is not here blamed in itself, as if it were a superstitious ceremony, but
abuse of fasting, and false confidence. This ought to be carefully observed; for
we would need to deal very differently with the Papists, if we blamed their
fasts. They contain nothing but superstition, being tied to this or that day, or
to fixed seasons, as if during the rest of the time they were at liberty to
gormandize; while they think that the flesh is unclean, and yet allow every kind
of indulgence to it; provided only that they do not once gormandize on a
fast-day, they think that they have discharged their duty admirably well. Since
therefore there is nothing in them that can be approved, we may absolutely
condemn them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But the dispute on this occasion
was different. That fasting which the Jews observed was laudable in itself,
because God had appointed it; but a false opinion respecting it was censurable.
Among the Papists, on the other hand, we must condemn both the false opinion and
the institution itself; because it is wicked. The Papists have this in common
with the Jews, that they think that they serve God by it, and that it is a
meritorious work. Yet fasting is not the worship of God, and is not in itself
commanded by him, in the same manner as those works which he enjoins in the Law;
but it is an external exercise, which is auxiliary to prayer, or is useful for
subduing the flesh, or testifying our humiliation, when, as guilty persons, we
implore that the wrath of God may be turned away in adversity. But the reader
will find the use and design of fasting more fully discussed in our Institutes.
(Book 4, chapter 12:15-21)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is it such a fast as I have
chosen? </i></font><font face="Palatino">He confirms the preceding statement,
and shows that fasting is neither desired nor approved by God in itself, but so
far as it is directed to its true end. He did not wish that it should be
altogether abolished, but the improper use of it; that is, because they believed
the worship of God to consist in it, and by neglecting or even despising true
godliness, thought that bodily exercise was enough; just as hypocrites always
put forward external ceremonies, as if they were satisfactions to appease
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Again, because men, through their rashness,
define what is the worship of God, he expressly refers us to his own will, that
we may not suppose that he approves of everything which our own judgment
pronounces to be right. Although men are well pleased with themselves, and swell
with astonishing haughtiness, and indulge in insolent boasting, the Lord rejects
and abhors them, because he claims for himself alone the right to "choose." Now,
"to choose" a thing is of the same import as "to take pleasure in
it."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And hanging his head like
a bulrush. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He says that he is not delighted if
a man passes a day in hunger, and then walks with a sad and downcast look. The
Prophet employs all appropriate metaphor; because the bulrush, though it is
straight, is easily bent. So hypocrites bend themselves, and bow down the head,
as if under the influence of oppressive leanness, or display some empty
appearance of humility. The Prophet therefore intended to censure superstitious
attitudes, in which hypocrites imagine that there is some
holiness.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And spread sackcloth
and ashes. </i></font><font face="Palatino">These things also were added to
fasting, especially when they made solemn professions of repentance; for they
clothed themselves with "sackcloth," and threw "ashes" on their head.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;290113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joel
1:13) Now, such an exercise was holy and approved by God; and we see that the
prophets, while they exhort the people to repentance, cry aloud for "sackcloth
and ashes." But as we have said that fasting is not here condemned on its own
account, so Isaiah does not condemn those outward ceremonies, but reproves
hypocrites for separating them from reality.</font><br><font face="Palatino">If
it be asked, Are "sackcloth" and "ashes" suitable to our time? I reply, they are
indifferent matters, which may be used for edification; but in the light of the
Gospel, which has brought liberty to us, we have no need of such figures. At the
same time, we should attend to the difference between Eastern nations, which
make use of a great abundance and variety of ceremonies, and Western nations,
whose habits are far more simple. If we wished to imitate the former, it would
be nothing else than to enact the part of apes, or of stage-players. Yet there
is nothing to hinder those who intend to confess their guilt, from wearing
soiled and faltered garments, after the manner used by suppliants. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F964</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A
day acceptable to Jehovah. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Hence it is evident
that to solemn prayer, when a holy assembly was held, there was added fasting;
for fasting, as we have already said, is an appendage to prayer; as we see that
it was added to prayer by Christ himself.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401721&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
17:21) It is not appointed, therefore, for its own sake, but is directed to a
different end.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is not this the fast which I
have chosen? </i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet shows what are the
real duties of piety, and what God chiefly recommends to us; namely, to relieve
those who are wretched and pressed with a heavy burden. But the Prophet appears
to abolish fasting universally, when, in place of it, he enumerates those works
which are most highly acceptable to God. I reply, fasting is approved when it is
accompanied by that love which we owe to our fellow-men; and therefore the
Prophet directs that we shall be tried by this principle, that our consciences
be entire and pure, that we exercise mutual kindness towards each other; for if
this order prevail, then fasting, which shall be added to it, will be pleasing
and acceptable to God. But here he does not at all mention purity of heart. I
reply, it is described by works, as by its fruits, from which it is easily seen
what kind of heart we have. Next, he enumerates the duties of the Second Table,
under which, as we have elsewhere seen, by a figure of speech in which a part is
taken for the whole, he includes the whole observation of the Law; for it would
not be enough to assist our neighbor by kind offices, if at the same time we
despised God. But we must observe the Prophet's design; because the love which
we owe to our neighbors cannot be sincerely cultivated, unless when we love them
in God. In order to make trial of our fear of God, he demands these as more
immediate signs, if we live justly, inoffensively, and kindly with each other.
Besides, he was not satisfied with outward appearance; and indeed the love of
our neighbor does not thrive where the Spirit of God does not reign; and
therefore Paul includes it in the enumeration of "the works of the Spirit."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480522&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
5:22) Thus when the observation of the Law is spoken of, not only outward works,
but likewise the dispositions of the heart, must be taken into the
account.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To loose wicked
bindings. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Some explain it to mean "sinful
thoughts," by which the hearts of men are entangled. But Isaiah appears to me to
have had another object in view, namely, that hypocrites are exceedingly cruel
in distressing the poor, and lay heavy burdens upon them. He therefore calls
them "bonds," or "bindings," or, as we commonly say, "oppressions." Of the same
import is what he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to undo
the heavy burdens</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> under the weight of
which the poor groan and are overwhelmed. he again adds, "to let the oppressed
go free," and expresses the same thing in a variety of words. Thus the Prophet
does not define what is meant by "fasting," but shows what the Lord requires in
the first place and chiefly, and in what manner our obedience can be approved by
him, and what ought to be the dispositions of those who endeavor to fast in a
right manner.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is it not to break thy bread
to the hungry? </i></font><font face="Palatino">He goes on to describe the
duties of love of our neighbor, which he had described briefly in the preceding
verse; for, having formerly said that we must abstain from every act of
injustice, he now shows that we ought to exercise kindness towards the wretched,
and those who need our assistance. Uprightness and righteousness are divided
into two parts; first, that we should injure nobody; and secondly, that we
should bestow our wealth and abundance on the poor and needy. And these two
ought to be joined together; for it is not enough to abstain from acts of
injustice, if thou refuse thy assistance to the needy; nor will it be of much
avail to render thine aid to the needy, if at the same time thou rob some of
that which thou bestowest on others. Thou must not relieve thy neighbors by
plunder or theft.; and if thou hast committed any act of injustice, or cruelty,
or extortion, thou must not, by a pretended compensation, call on God to receive
a share of the plunder. These two parts, therefore, must be held together,
provided only that we have our love of our neighbor approved and accepted by
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By commanding them to "break bread to the
hungry, 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F965</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he intended to take away every excuse from covetous and greedy men, who allege
that they have a right to keep possession of that which is their own. "This is
mine, and therefore I may keep it for myself. Why should I make common property
of that which God has given me? " He replies, "It is indeed thine, but on this
condition, that thou share it with the hungry and thirsty, not that thou eat it
thyself alone." And indeed this is the dictate of common sense, that the hungry
are deprived of their just right, if their hunger is not relieved. That sad
spectacle extorts compassion even from the cruel and barbarous. He next
enumerates various kinds, which commonly bend hearts of iron to
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sumpa&gt;qeian</font><font face="Palatino">
fellow-feeling or compassion; that the savage disposition of those who are not
moved by feeling for a brother's poverty and necessity may be the less
excusable. At length he concludes
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And that thou hide not
thyself from thine own flesh. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Here we ought to
observe the term flesh, by which he means all men universally, not one of whom
we can behold, without seeing, as in a mirror, "our own flesh." It is therefore
a proof of the greatest inhumanity, to despise those in whom we are constrained
to recognize our own likeness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then shall break forth as the
dawn </i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F966</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thy light.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet shows that God is not too rigorous,
and does not demand from us more than what is proper; and that hypocrites
complain of him without cause, when they accuse him of excessive severity. When
their works are condemned, they murmur, and reply that God can never be
satisfied, that they do not know what they should do, or what course they should
follow. He replies that he demands nothing else than a pure and honest heart,
that is, an upright conscience; that if they have this, God will graciously
receive them, and will bear testimony to their holiness, and will bestow every
kind of blessing on those whose faults he justly chastises; and lastly, that
there is no reason why they should murmur at him as excessively stern and harsh,
because they will find him to be kind and bountiful when they shall lay down all
hypocrisy, and devote themselves sincerely to his
service.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We should observe the particle <i>then;
</i>for it means that hypocrites, on the contrary, are very far from the true
worship of God, though they wish to be reckoned very holy persons. But he holds
them to be fully convicted, when he shows from their works that they neither
worship nor fear God. By the word light he means prosperity, as by the word
"darkness" is meant a wretched and afflicted life; and this mode of expression
occurs frequently in
Scripture.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thy health.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">By "health" he means prosperity and safety, as
we shall afterwards see in another passage, because the wounds inflicted by the
hand of God on account of their sins had brought the people so low that they
wasted away like a sick man under terrible disease. No kind of disease is more
severe than to be pursued by God's righteous vengeance, or consumed under his
curse.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Righteousness shall go
before thy face. </i></font><font face="Palatino">"Righteousness" may be taken
in two senses, either for the testimony of "righteousness," or for good order;
because God will put an end to the confusion, and will restore everything to its
proper place. Thus the former meaning amounts to this, "When God shall be
pacified towards thee, the testimony of thy righteousness shall be visible
before God and men, as if some herald went before thee." There are some who
prefer to expound the word "righteousness" as meaning just government, which is
the gift of God, and a token of his kindness as a Father; and we have seen that
this word is sometimes used in that sense by Hebrew writers. But the latter
clause which follows, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the
glory of Jehovah will gather thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> leads
me to prefer the former exposition, "Thy righteousness shall go forth; " that
is, "All shall acknowledge thee to be holy and righteous, though formerly thou
wast guilty and convicted. So shalt thou also be adorned with the glory of the
Lord, though formerly thou wast loaded with reproaches." For we are reproached
and disgraced, while we suffer the punishment of our
sins.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then shalt thou call.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Isaiah follows out what he had formerly begun,
that everything shall prosper well with the Jews, if they shall be just and
inoffensive and free from doing wrong to any one, so that it shall manifest
their piety and religion. He pronounces what is said by Hosea,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;270606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
6:6) and repeated by Christ, that "mercy shall be preferred to sacrifice."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400913&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
9:13; 12:7) Thus after having spoken of the duties which men owe to one another,
and testified that it shall be well with those who shall perform those duties,
he adds, "Then shalt thou call, and the Lord will listen to thee." The chief
part of our happiness is, if God listen to us; and, on the other hand, nothing
could be more miserable than to have him for an enemy. In order to try our
faith, he attributes to our prayers what he bestows willingly and by free grace;
for if he always bestowed his blessings while we were asleep, the desire to pray
would become utterly cold, and indeed would cease altogether; and so the
kindness of God would be an encouragement to slothfulness. Although he
anticipates us by his free grace, yet he wishes that our prayers for his
blessings should be offered, and therefore he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt cry, and he shall say,
Behold, here I am</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This promise likewise
contains an exhortation, that we may not lie idle. When he says that he is
present, this indeed is not visible to our eyes; but he gives a practical
declaration that he is near and reconciled to
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If thou shalt take away
from the midst of thee the yoke. </i></font><font face="Palatino">In the latter
part of the verse he again repeats that God will be reconciled to the Jews if
they repent. Under the word "yoke" he includes all the annoyances that are
offered to the poor; as if he had said, "If thou shalt cease to annoy thy
brethren, and shalt abstain from all violence and deceit, the Lord will bestow
upon thee every kind of
blessing."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the pointing of
the finger. </i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F967</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This includes every kind of attack; for we are said to "point the finger," when
we threaten our neighbors, or treat them cruelly, or offer any
violence.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And speech of
vanity, or unprofitable speech. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This is the
third class of acts of injustice, by which we injure our neighbor when we impose
upon him by cunning and deceitful words or flatteries; for every iniquity
consists either of concealed malice and deceit, or of open
violence.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If thou shalt pour out thy
soul to the hungry. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He goes on to recommend the
duties of that love which we owe to one another. The sum of the whole discourse
is this, that in vain do men serve God, if they only offer to him trivial and
bare ceremonies; and that this is not the right and proper worship of God, who
rigidly commands and enjoins us to lead an upright and innocent life with our
neighbors, willingly to give ourselves and our labors to them, and to be ready
to assist, them readily and cheerfully, whenever it is necessary. We should
observe the two parts of this duty which the Prophet has expressly described;
for in the first place, he recommends to us the feeling of mercy and kindness;
and, in the second place, he exhorts us to the work itself and the effect. It
would not be enough to perform acts of kindness towards men, if our disposition
towards them were not warm and affectionate. "If I give all my goods to the
poor," says Paul, "and have not love, I am nothing."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 13:3) To "pour out the soul," therefore, is nothing else than to
bewail their distresses, and to be as much affected by their own poverty as if
we ourselves endured it; as, on the other hand, all who are limited and devoted
to themselves are said to have a hard and seared heart, to "shut up their
bowels,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;620317&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 3:17) and to restrain their feelings. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F968</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Another translation given by some commentators, "If thou shalt offer thy soul,"
is unworthy of notice.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy
light shall arise in darkness. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Again, there
follows the same promise, and under the same figure or metaphor. By "darkness"
he denotes adversity, and by "light" prosperity; as if he had said to the
people, "The Lord will cause all the miseries by which thou art now oppressed to
cease, and sudden prosperity shall spring up." He shows, therefore, that there
is no reason why they should blame God for punishing them so severely; for they
would immediately be delivered and enjoy prosperity if they sincerely worshipped
and obeyed God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jehovah will always
conduct thee. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He now describes more clearly
what he had spoken briefly and figuratively, that God will be their guide, so
that they shall be in want of nothing for a full abundance of blessings. God is
said to "conduct" us, when we actually feel that he goes before us, as if he
were placed before our
eyes.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And will satisfy thy
soul in drought. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet adds that the aid
promised shall not be of short duration, because God never forsakes his people
in the middle of the journey, but continues his kindness towards them with
unwearied regularity, and for this reason promises that they shall be satisfied
amidst the deepest poverty; because God never is in want of any benefits for
relieving their poverty, and his act of blessing is of more value than the most
abundant rains of the whole year. And yet he does not promise to believers a
rich and abundant produce of fruits, or a plentiful harvest, but that God will
nourish them, though the earth yield no food. In this way he bids them depend on
God's assistance and be satisfied with it, though they be not altogether free
from the distresses of famine. In this sense he adds,
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And will make fat thy
bones. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He does not say that they shall be fully
and highly fattened, but that they shall be so lean that the "bones" shall
protrude even through the skin. Thus he gives the appellation of" bones" to
those who have been worn bare by hunger or famine, men who have hardly anything
remaining but dry skin and "bones;" and he means that the Jews will have to
contend with want of all things and with leanness, till God shall restore
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Of the same import are the metaphors which
he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a watered
garden</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a spring of
waters</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Isaiah cannot satisfy himself in
describing the kindness of God, which he displays towards his sincere
worshippers, that men may not seek anywhere else than in themselves the causes
of barrenness. It amounts to this, that this fountain of God's kindness never
dries up, but always flows, if we do not stop its course by our own
fault.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And from thee shall be those
who shall restore the deserts of the age. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By
"deserts" Isaiah means frightful desolation, which befell the Jews, when they
were carried into captivity; for the country was reduced to a wilderness, the
city was sacked, the temple was razed, and the people were brought into bondage
and scattered. He calls them "deserts of the age," (or of perpetuity,) because
the temple could not be immediately repaired, and there was no hope of
rebuilding it or of delivering the people. If any city has been ruined or
destroyed, while its inhabitants remain, it may be speedily restored; but if
none of the inhabitants survive, and if they have been carried away into a
distant country, and are very far off, there can be no hope of rebuilding that
city; and it will be reckoned monstrous if, after it has lain for a long time in
ruins, some person shall say that the people who appear to have perished shall
restore and rebuild it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Since therefore the
promise appeared to be incredible, the Prophet intended to meet the doubt; for
they might have objected, "If God wishes to restore us, why does he suffer us to
languish so long?" He replies that no continuance of delay prevents God from
raising again to a lofty situation those who had been sunk low for a long
period. Nor must this be limited to the rebuilding of the temple, which was
begun by Zerubbabel,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;260308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
3:8) and continued by Nehemiah; but it includes the restoration of the Church,
which followed after the lapse of several
centuries.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The phrase "From thee," means that
from that people, though seemingly half dead, there shall arise those who shall
repair the melancholy ruins, and shall be architects or workmen to rebuild
Jerusalem. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wnb</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>banu</i>) "shall build," is translated by some in a passive sense; but as
that way renders the meaning doubtful, the active signification ought to be
retained. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F969</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
A little afterwards, he appears to ascribe to the whole people what he had said
of a few individuals; but the meaning is the same; for, if the question be put,
"Who rebuilt Jerusalem? " undoubtedly it was that people; but out of that vast
multitude the Lord selected a small number and cut off the rest. Some suppose
the meaning to be, that the cities will be insufficient for the number of
inhabitants, so that they shall be constrained to rebuild other cities which had
been formerly destroyed; but this appears to be too
unnatural.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou wilt raise up
the foundations of generation and generation.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Some think that this clause conveys what the
Prophet had formerly said, and that by "the foundations of generation and
generation" are meant those which lay long in a ruinous state; because out of
them must the building be immediately raised and set up; for various hinderances
had arisen, by which that work was interrupted. But we may view it as referring
to the time to come: "Thou wilt raise up buildings, which shall last for a very
long period;" for he seems to promise that the condition of the Church shall be
of long duration; as if he had said, "Other buildings do not last long, but this
shall last for many ages." Yet if any one prefer to view it as referring to the
past, I am not much disposed to dispute with
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt be called.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet includes both statements;
namely, that the people would resemble a ruined building, and next, that they
would be perfectly restored. He ascribes this to the Jews, that they shall be
repairers and directors of the ways; that is, that the Lord will make use of
their labors; for we ought to ascribe everything to the power of God, who is
pleased to bestow upon us so high an honor as to permit our hands to be applied
to his work. We have here a remarkable promise about gathering and raising up
the ruins of the Church; and since the Lord is pleased to make use of our labor,
let us not hesitate to be entirely devoted to it; and although the world oppose
and mock at us, and account us fools, let us take courage and conquer every
difficulty. Our hearts ought to cherish assured confidence, when we know that it
is the work of the Lord, and that he has commanded us to execute
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If thou shalt turn away thy
foot from the sabbath.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some think that the
Prophet alludes to the external observation of the Sabbath, because it was not
lawful to perform a journey on that day.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;022008&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
20:8) Though I do not reject that opinion, yet I think that the meaning is far
more extensive; for by a figure of speech, ill which a part is taken for the
whole, he denotes the whole course of human life; as it is very customary to
employ the word "going" or "walking" to denote our life. He says, therefore, "If
thou cease to advance in thy course, if thou shut up thy path, walk not
according to thine own will,"' etc. For this is to "turn away the foot from the
Sabbath," when we lay ourselves under the necessity of wandering freely and
without restraint in our own sinful desires. As he formerly included under the
class of fasting all ceremonies and outward masks, in which they made their
holiness to consist, and showed that they were vain and unprofitable; so in this
passage he points out the true observation of the Sabbath, that they may not
think that it consists in external idleness but in true self-denial, so as to
abstain from every act of injustice and wickedness, and from all lusts and
wicked thoughts. First, by the word "foot" he denotes actions; because the Jews,
though they did not venture to perform a journey, or to cook flesh on a
Sabbath-day, yet did not scruple to harass their neighbors and to mock at the
afflicted. Yet he immediately passes on to the will and to speeches, so as to
include every part of the obedience which we owe to
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And shalt call the
Sabbath a delight</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This word, "delight,"
must be viewed as referring to God, and not to men; because nothing can be more
pleasing or acceptable to God, titan the observation of the Sabbath, and sincere
worship. He carefully inculcates this, that men do wrong, if, laying aside the
commandments of God, they esteem highly those things which are of no value; and
he warns them that they ought to form their judgment from his will alone.
Certain classes of duties are again enumerated by him, by which he shows clearly
that the true observation of the Sabbath consists in self-denial and thorough
conversion. And thus he pronounces the foundation to be the will, from which
proceed speeches, and next actions; for we speak what we have conceived in our
heart, and by speech we make known our will, and afterwards carry it into
effect. Whoever then wishes to serve God in a proper manner, must altogether
renounce his flesh and his will. And hence we see the reason why God so highly
recommends, in the whole Scripture, the observation of the Sabbath; for he
contemplated something higher than the outward ceremony, that is, indolence and
repose, in which the Jews thought that the greatest holiness consisted. On the
contrary, he commanded the Jews to renounce the desires of the flesh, to give up
their sinful inclinations, and to yield obedience to him; as no man can meditate
on the heavenly life, unless he be dead to the world and to himself. Now,
although that ceremony has been abolished, nevertheless the truth remains;
because Christ died and rose again, so that we have a continual sabbath; that
is, we are released from our works, that the Spirit of God may work mightily in
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then wilt thou delight in
Jehovah. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He appears to allude to the word
<i>delight </i>in the preceding verse; for the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">gg[tt</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>tithgnanneg</i>) which the Prophet employs, is derived from the same root as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">gg[</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>gnoneg</i>) which he formerly used, when he said that the Lord takes the
highest delight in the true observation of the Sabbath. In a word, he means that
the people take no delight in God, because they provoke him, and do not obey his
will; for if we framed our life in obedience to God, we should be his delight,
and, on the other hand, he would be our delight. Thus he affirms that it is
owing entirely to the Jews themselves that they do not, by relying on a
reconciled God, lead a cheerful and joyful life. By these words he indirectly
reproaches them with bringing upon themselves, by their own fault, many
calamities.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will cause
thee to ride on the high places of the earth.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">By these words he promises a return to their
native country, and a safe habitation in it. We know that Judea was situated on
a lofty place above the neighboring countries; while the situation of Babylon
was much lower, so that the people trembled as if they had been shut up in a
cave. He next tells more plainly what he meant by the word <i>ride </i> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F970</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for he promises the possession of that country which had been promised and given
to the fathers, 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F971</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and which they at that time enjoyed, and of which they were afterwards deprived
for a time.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the mouth of
Jehovah hath spoken it. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He added this, that
they might know, beyond all controversy, that all these things were true; and
this must be viewed as referring not only to those promises, but likewise to the
beginning of the chapter. For he rebuked hypocrites, who thought that they were
defending themselves in a just cause, and showed that they were suffering the
just punishment of their sins; and that it was in vain to contend with God, and
to bring forward in opposition to him their own works, which were altogether
empty and worthless. On that account he brings them back to the true observation
of the Sabbath, and shows that it will be well with them, if they shall worship
God in a right manner. At length he concludes that they have not to deal with a
mortal man, but that he who pronounces these things is God the
Judge.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, the hand of Jehovah
is not shortened.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This discourse closely
resembles the preceding one; for, after having torn off the mask from
hypocrites, who vainly boasted of themselves, and after having shown that the
punishment inflicted on them was just, he now replies to other objections.
Hypocrites are wont to accuse God either of weakness or of excessive severity.
He shows, therefore, that he does not want either power or will to save his
people, but that he is prevented by their wickedness from exercising his
kindness towards them; and therefore that. they do wrong in blaming God, and in
uttering those slanders against him, when they ought, on the contrary, to accuse
themselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;h</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>hen</i>) "behold," is emphatic, as if the Prophet spoke of something
actually present, and pointed it out with the finger, for the sake of expressing
certainty, in order to cut off a handle from hypocrites, that they might no
longer practice evasion. We must also supply the contrasts to the words
"shortened" and "benumbed; " as if he had said, that formerly there were
abundant resources in the hand of God to render assistance to his people, and
that he always was ready to be reconciled and lent a willing car to prayers, and
that now he is not unlike himself, 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F972</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as if either his hand were broken or his ears grown dull, so that he did not
hear distinctly.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But your iniquities have made
a separation. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The amount of what is said is,
that they cannot say that God has changed, as if he had swerved from his natural
disposition, but that the whole blame lies with themselves; because by their own
sins they, in some measure, prevent his kindness, and refuse to receive his
assistance. Hence we infer that our sins alone deprive us of the grace of God,
and cause separation between us and him; for what the Prophet testifies as to
the men of his time is applicable to all ages; since he pleads the cause of God,
against the slanders of wicked men. Thus God is always like himself, and is not
wearied in doing good; and his power is not diminished, but we hinder the
entrance of his grace.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It will be objected, that
men cannot anticipate God by deserving well of him, and that consequently he
must do good to those who are unworthy. I reply, this is undoubtedly true; but
sometimes the frowardness of men grows to such an extent as to shut the door
against God's benefits, as if they purposely intended to drive him far away from
them. And although he listens to no man without pardoning him, as we always
bring before him supplication for the removal of guilt, yet he does not listen
to the prayers of the wicked. We need not wonder, therefore, if the Prophet
accuse the people of rejecting God's benefits by their iniquities, and rendering
him irreconcilable by their obstinacy, and, in a word, of making a divorce,
which drives away or turns aside the ordinary course of
grace.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For your hands.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He now brings forward their actions, that they
may not practice evasion, or call in question what are those sins which have
"caused the separation." He therefore takes away from them every excuse, by
bringing forward particular instances, as if their shameful life were exhibited
on an open stage. Now, he speaks in the second person, because, like an
advocate, he argues and pleads the cause of God, and therefore speaks of himself
as not belonging to the rank of the wicked, with whom he did not wish to be
classed, though he was not entirely free from sin, but feared and served God,
and enjoyed liberty of conscience. No man could be at liberty to condemn others,
who was involved in the guilt of the same vices; and no man could be qualified
for pleading the cause of God, who deprived himself of his right by living
wickedly. We must be unlike those whom we reprove, if we do not wish to expose
our doctrine to ridicule, and to be reckoned impudent; and, on the other band,
when we serve God with a pure conscience, our doctrine obtains weight and
authority, and holds even adversaries to be more fully
convicted.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Are polluted with
blood. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The picture which he gives of the wicked
life of the people is not superfluous; for men seek various subterfuges, and
cannot be reduced to a state of obedience, unless they have previously
acknowledged their sins. By mentioning <i>blood, </i>he does not mean that
murders have been everywhere committed; but by this word he describes the
cruelty, extortions, violence, and enormities, which were perpetrated by
hypocrites against the poor and defenseless; for they had not to deal with
robbers and assassins, but with the king and the nobles, who were highly
respected and honored. He calls them manslayers, because they cruelly harassed
the innocent, and seized by force and violence the property of others; and so,
immediately afterwards he uses the word "iniquity" instead of
"blood."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And your fingers with
iniquity. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Though he appears to extend the
discourse farther, yet it is a repetition, or rather, a reduplication, such as
is frequently employed by Hebrew writers, accompanied by amplification; for he
expresses more by "fingers" than by "hands; " as if he had said that not even
the smallest part was free from unjust violence. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F973</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Your
lips have uttered falsehood. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Next, he takes
notice of one kind of wickedness, that is, when men deceive each other by
tricks, or falsehood, or perjury; for that iniquity by which we wound our
neighbors is most frequently defended either by cruelty as a body-guard, or by
cheating and falsehood. Here the Prophet takes a rapid view of the second table,
and, from the crimes which they commit against it, he shows that they are wicked
and destitute of all fear of God; for cruelty and treachery, by which human
society is infringed, proceed from contempt of God. Thus from "the hands," that
is, from extortion and violence, he descends to falsehoods and deceitful
practices, to perjuries and crafty devices, by which we take advantage of our
neighbors.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There is none that crieth for
justice. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He means that there is not among them
any study of what is right or proper, that no man opposes the acts of injustice
which are committed by the strong on the weak; and that this leads to growing
licentiousness, because all wink at it, and there is none who cares about
undertaking the defense of justice. It is not enough that we abstain from
violence, if we do not, as far as lies in our power, hinder it from being
committed by others. And, indeed, whoever permits what he is able to hinder does
in some sense command it; so that silence is a sort of
consent.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>None that contendeth
for truth. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This clause is of the same import as
the preceding one. Some take
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">fp&ccedil;n</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>nishpat</i>) in a passive sense, and suppose the Prophet's meaning to be,
"None is rightly judged; for everything is full of corruptions, and yet nobody
makes opposition." But the active signification is more appropriate; for these
two statements are closely connected with each other, that "None crieth for
justice" and "None defendeth truth or uprightness." The rendering given by some,
"No man judgeth himself truly," is rather too harsh. But because this verb in
Niphal is taken, in many passages, for "to contend,"  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F974</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the whole passage appeared to run more freely thus: that "none comes forward to
protect what is right, openly and loudly to defend justice, and to plead against
the wicked." Yet it will perhaps be thought preferable to view the words "cry
for justice" as referring to wretched persons who are unjustly harassed; as if
he had said that they are dumb, because they would gain nothing by crying. But
this would also be harsh.</font><br><font face="Palatino">If God condemns so
severely those who pay no attention to the righteous causes of men, and do not
aid such as are in difficulties, what shall become of us, if no zeal for
defending the glory of God prompt us to rebuke iniquities? If we wink at the
mockeries by which wicked men jeer at God's sacred doctrine and profane his
name; if we pay no attention to the efforts which they make to destroy the
Church of God, shall not our silence be justly condemned for treachery?  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F975</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In a word, Isaiah says that good order falls into decay through our fault, if we
do not, as far as we can, resist the
wicked.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They trust in vain
things. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He next points out that this is extreme
confusion, when no one rises up in defense of justice. When he says that they
"trust in vain things," he means that they heap up perverse reliances, by means
of which they bring upon themselves insensibility. This is the utmost verge of
iniquity, when, by seeking flatteries on every hand, they willingly harden
themselves to despise God; and by such allurements Satan caresses the reprobate,
till he altogether enchants them, so that, shaking off all fear of God, they not
only despise sound counsels, but become haughty and fearless mockers. Since
therefore foolhardiness drives us headlong, when we place false hopes in
opposition to the judgment of God, the Prophet has good reason for representing,
as a mark of desperate malice, this confidence under which cunning men shelter
themselves; because the disease is manifestly incurable, when men who are openly
wicked do not hesitate to flatter themselves, and, relying on their obstinate
wickedness, think that they are at liberty to do whatever they
please.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They talk idly.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He adds that their conversation tells plainly
what is the nature of their dispositions and morals; as the proverb says, that
"the tongue is the image of the mind." Yet this clause may be explained in two
ways; either that they speak nothing sincerely, but, by constant practice, their
tongues are formed to deceive, or, that their wickedness breaks out into open
boasting. For my own part, I prefer the latter of these
expositions.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They conceive
mischief, and bring forth iniquity. </i></font><font face="Palatino">These are
elegant metaphors, by which he compares wicked men to women, who support the
child in the womb, and afterwards give birth to it. Thus he says that the
wicked, while they inwardly contrive their crimes, may be said to be pregnant
till they bring forth in due time; that is, when they have found occasions and
opportunities. "They conceive," he says, "purposes of mischief, that afterwards
they may unjustly harass simple persons;" as if he had said, that they make
preparation for their crimes by long meditation, and are always ready for any
mischief; because they do not cease to search in every quarter for indirect
methods of annoying those who are giving them no
disturbance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They hatch the eggs of the
basilisk. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet proceeds farther,
comparing the Jews not only to women, but to venomous beasts; so as to make it
more evident that everything that proceeds from them is destructive and deadly.
First, then, he says, that "they hatch the eggs of the basilisk; " because, as a
viper cannot lay an egg that is not venomous, so they are so inured to
wickedness, and so full of it, that they can throw out nothing but poison. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F976</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
weave the webs of spiders. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By "the webs of
spiders" he means that they are so barren and destitute of anything good, that
even by the appearance of virtues they deceive. By two marks he describes wicked
men; first, that the works which they perform manifest their corrupt nature;
secondly, that they are of no value whatever, and. contribute nothing towards
making them kind, amiable, charitable, and faithful to those with whom they have
intercourse. I am aware that it is explained ill a different manner by other
commentators; namely, that the wicked, while they are contriving the destruction
of others, ruin themselves, and, while they think that they are industrious,
labor fruitlessly and to no purpose; that "they are snared in their own nets,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;190915&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
9:15) and "fall into the pit which they had digged."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;190715&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
7:15) But I am of opinion that the Prophet meant what I have now said; namely,
that the wicked do mischief in all places, at all times, and in all
transactions, and that they never do anything good; and that every person who
has anything to do with them will find them to be venomous and destructive. Such
is the import of what he says, that in their eggs there lurks a deadly venom,
and that, if they are broken, a serpent will come out of
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their webs shall not be for
clothing. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He repeats and confirms the same
statement, that everything that they attempt or undertake is always useless to
mankind; because they purposely shrink from all acts of kindness. Now, it is an
indication of a mind utterly abandoned, to devote themselves to evil deeds in
such a manner, that no advantage of any kind can be expected from the life of
him who desires to be barren and destitute of all justice. Others explain it,
that they will toil unsuccessfully to acquire wealth and to rise to honor. But I
consider the meaning to be more simple, that no man will "cover himself with
their works," because in their texture there is nothing solid or durable.  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F977</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">By
various modes of expression he inculcates the same thing, in order to
demonstrate that their works yield no advantage whatever. But we were born for
this end, that we should yield assistance to our neighbors, and, in our turn,
contribute something to the general good. Thus they are savage beasts, and ought
not to be called men, who are only skillful to do mischief, and labor with all
their might to avoid doing good. he immediately adds, without a figure, that
they are given up, and, as it were, devoted to
iniquity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their feet run to evil.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">In various ways he paints to us the picture of
what may be called extreme wickedness; that is, when men, having shaken off and
cast away from them the fear of God, throw themselves into every kind of
wickedness, and break out into all cruelty, extortion, and outrage. He says that
they <i>run, </i>because they are eager and hasten with excessive keenness to
evil actions. Having formerly spoken of the "hands" and the "tongues," he
likewise adds the feet, in order to show that they are proficients  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F978</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in every kind of villainy, and that there is no part of their body that is
entirely free from crime. Some are violent, but restrain their tongues. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F979</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Others resemble harpies, but are satisfied with the first prey that they meet
with. But the Prophet says that his countrymen are swift of foot for committing
robberies. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F980</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wasting
and destruction are in their paths. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He means
that, wherever they go, they will resemble wild beasts, which seize and devour
whatever they meet with, and leave nothing behind, so that, by their terrific
onset, they drive away every kind of animals from venturing to approach to them.
Pliny makes use of the same comparison, when speaking of Domitian, whose arrival
was like that of a savage beast. The same thing happens with other violent men,
whom all avoid as wild beasts. And in this manner their ways are rendered
desolate and solitary, when none have any intercourse with
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The way of peace they know
not. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Some give an ingenious interpretation of
the word "peace" as meaning a "peaceful" conscience; because the wicked must
endure continual agony. But the Prophet summons wicked men to judgment, in order
to show, by the transgression of the Second Table, that they have no sincerity
and no kindness, and, in a word, that they are
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajsto&gt;rgouv</font><font face="Palatino">
without natural affection. He says that "they know not the way of peace; "
because their cruelty deprives them of justice and equity, by which human
society is maintained, the very food of which is mutual peace and kindness; for
justice and integrity are nourished by peace. And if every person, with
unbridled rage, rush on his neighbors and attack them, there is then open war;
for harmony cannot be preserved among us, unless equity be observed by every
individual.  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F981</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
judgment is not in their steps. </i></font><font face="Palatino">What he had
just before said is expressed more clearly by the word "Judgment;" as if he had
said, that they excite terror wherever they go, because they lay aside all
integrity.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whosoever walketh
by them. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The last clause may be taken in
various senses; either, "Whosoever walketh in them shall also be a stranger to
peace," or, "He who falleth into the hands of the wicked shall find them to be
savage and barbarous." Either of those meanings is admissible, and I do not
think it worth while to dispute much about them. Thus, after having spoken in
general terms, and after having shown that it is not God who prevents the Jews
from being prosperous, the Prophet descends to particulars, by which he explains
more fully the manner in which they have become estranged from God, and have
rendered themselves unworthy of his favor.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here
arises a difficulty; for Paul
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450317&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:17) quotes this passage for the purpose of condemning all mankind as being
sinful and corrupted, and as having nothing good; while the Prophet appears to
apply it especially to the men of his own time. But the answer is easy; for,
while he expressly addresses the Jews, who thought that they were holier than
other men, the Gentiles must also be included along with them. If it be objected
that the Gentiles, while they live uprightly, "are a law to themselves,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
2:14) and that "uncircumcision is counted as circumcision,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450226&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
2:26) I reply that the Prophet represents God as complaining of all who have not
been renewed by the Spirit of God. In this manner no man can be excepted, if he
be viewed in his own nature; but the Prophet speaks of himself as not belonging
to their number, because he had been regenerated and was guided by the Spirit of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Paul's quotation of this passage was
therefore appropriate; because he intended to show what sort of men they are
whom God hath forsaken, and who are under the influence of their own nature.
Although the depravity of men does not always break out into gross vice, and the
Prophet's design is to rebuke a very corrupt age; yet whenever crimes become so
prevalent, we may behold, as in a mirror, what a pool and how deep a pool of
every evil thing is the nature of man. And yet this discourse was undoubtedly
very distasteful to the Jews, who were puffed up with vain glorying of the
family from which they were descended; but since even they were not spared by
the Spirit of God, there is no reason why other nations, who are not less sinful
by nature, should wallow in their
pleasures.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore is judgment far
from us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> After having described how corrupt and
depraved was the condition of that people, he likewise shows that the severe
chastisements inflicted on them are richly deserved, that they may not complain
of being treated with greater harshness and severity than was proper. Thus he
has painted, as in a picture, those vices which were publicly known, that they
might more fully perceive in how many and how various ways they were guilty
before God; and now he again repeats that we need not wonder if God treat such
obstinate dispositions with greater severity, and render to them a just reward.
He says that "Judgment is far off, because they were the most wretched of all
men, and had not God for their protector as
formerly."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And justice doth
not overtake us. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He employs the words
"judgment" and "justice" as denoting God's guardianship, when he defends us, and
shows that he takes care of us. He calls it "justice" when he defends us, and
"judgment" when he revenges the injuries done to us. Here he declares that God
had cast away the care of his people, and had deprived them of his countenance
and aid, because they were unworthy of it; and hence we ought to observe the
particle </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;k
l[</font><font face="Palatino"> (<i>gnal ken</i>) "therefore;" for he draws the
conclusion that we ought not to blame God, as if he acted unjustly towards his
people, since in so many ways they had insulted his
majesty.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Of the same import is what he adds,
that while </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they look for
light</i></font><font face="Palatino">, continual darkness sits down upon them;
for the metaphor shows that they were almost consumed by their calamities, and
that, when they promised to themselves any alleviation, they were disappointed
of their hope.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Light</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is a word very frequently employed to denote prosperity, and <i>darkness
</i>to denote adversity. He means, therefore, that it will be vain to expect
that their condition shall be changed for the better; and his object is, that
the people may learn to ascribe their calamities to themselves, and may not
imagine that those calamities happen by chance, or that the Lord is excessively
severe; for he always endeavors to bring his people to the doctrine of
repentance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We grope for the wall like
the blind. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He explains the same thing by
different forms of expression; for, in consequence of the grievous complaints
which were heard among the people, he determined to omit nothing that was fitted
to describe their calamities. It is perhaps by way of concession  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F982</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that he mentions those things; as if he had said, "Our affairs are reduced to
the deepest misery, but we ought chiefly to consider the cause, for we have
deserved all this and far worse." But it is not a probable interpretation, that
stupid persons are aroused to think of their evil actions; for, although they
are abundantly disposed to complain, yet the devil stupifies them, so that the
tokens of God's anger do not awaken them to repentance, he alludes to that
metaphor which he employed in the preceding verse, when he said that the people
were in darkness and obscurity, and found no escape; and. his meaning is, that
they are destitute of counsel, and overwhelmed by so deep anguish that they have
no solace or refuge. When a lighter evil presses upon us, we look around and
hope to find some means of escape; but when we are overpowered by heavier
distresses, despair takes from us all ability to see or to judge. For this
reason the Prophet says that they have been thrown into a labyrinth, and are
"groping."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We stumble.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">The same thing is expressed, and even in a
still more aggravated form, by this mode of expression, that, if they stir a
foot, various stumbling blocks meet them on every hand, and, indeed, that there
is no alleviation to their distresses, as if day had been changed into
night.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In solitary places as
dead men. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By "solitary places" I understand
either gulfs or ruinous and barren regions; for in this passage I willingly
follow the version of Jerome, who derives the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ynm&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>ashmannim</i>) from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>asham,</i>)"to be desolate." The Jews, who choose to derive it from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;m&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>shaman,</i>) to be fat, appear to me to argue idly, and to have no solid
ground for their opinion. They think that it denotes men, because
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;m&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>shemen</i>) denotes "ointment," and say that this word is used for
describing the Gentiles. But the true meaning of the Prophet is, that the Jews
have been reduced to a wilderness, so that, shut out from the society of men,
they resemble the dead, and have no hope of
escape.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>l1.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We all roar like bears.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He describes two classes of those who cannot
silently endure their afflictions without making them known by external signs;
for some howl fiercely, and others <i>moan like doves</i>. This latter metaphor
was employed by him in describing the groans of Hezekiah,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233814&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
38:14; ) and this happens when we endeavor to restrain our grief, and yet cannot
prevent the outward signs of grief from breaking out in spite of us. The meaning
is, that sometimes the violence of their grief constrained them to utter loud
cries, and sometimes they complained in low and murmuring sounds, but in both
cases without avail, because their condition was not changed for the
better.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We looked for
judgment. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He again repeats that in vain they
"looked for judgment and salvation," meaning that the people were deprived of
the assistance of God, which he desired above all things; and he makes use of
the word <i>salvation, </i>in order to describe more fully and completely what
he formerly denoted by the word "justice," and now again by the word "judgment."
Thence infer that it is by our own fault that we are wretched, and grow old and
waste away in our wretchedness, till we are converted to God. We may indeed moan
and howl, but can obtain no alleviation of our grief without repentance. There
can be no end of our afflictions, so long as we provoke the Lord's wrath, and do
not desire with the whole heart to be reconciled to
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For our iniquities are
multiplied before thee. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He confirms what he
formerly said, namely, that the people act unjustly in accusing God of cruelty,
and in not understanding that they are justly punished for their iniquities, the
huge mass of which towers up to heaven; and in this sense the Prophet says that
they "are multiplied." There is also much weight in the phrase "before thee;"
for the Prophet descends into himself, and acknowledges the righteous judgment
of God, which was hidden from men. Thus he intended to point out an implied
contrast between the judgment of God and the judgment of men, who flatter
themselves, and do not consider their sins; but God, who is a just judge, does
not the less on that account reprove them, or pay any attention to the frivolous
excuses under which they endeavor to shelter themselves. For this reason he does
not reckon it enough simply to condemn the people, but says that they have
"multiplied" their sins, that is, in many respects they are guilty before God.
He acknowledges, therefore, that the Lord is righteous, and performs the part of
an excellent judge; since nothing good or right is found among men; and
therefore he adds, &#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino">Our sins have
testified against us, (<i>or, answer </i> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F983</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
<i>to us</i>.) Witnesses are not summoned, or brought from heaven; but the Jews
are rebuked and condemned by the testimony of conscience. That mode of
expression ought to be carefully observed; for it shows that God does not need
many proofs, since our sins hold us to be sufficiently convicted. We must not,
therefore, strive with God, as if he punished us unjustly, or chastised us too
severely; for our sins openly proclaim what we are, and God does not need
additional proofs.</font><br><font face="Palatino">For our iniquities are with
us. Instead of "with us," some render
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wnta</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>ittanu</i>)"upon us;" but I choose rather to adhere to the strict meaning of
the word. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F984</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Men practice evasions, and assume various shapes, in order to appear righteous;
but in vain, for they carry with them their iniquities, from which they cannot
extricate themselves; as God, in condemning Cain,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
4:7) declares that "sin keepeth watch before the door; " so that any one who
despises the judgment of God shall in vain attempt to escape by his
rebellion.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And we know our
sins. </i></font><font face="Palatino">When he says that the Jews "know their
sins," he does not mean that their hearts are truly affected by them, for in
that case repentance follows; but he declares that, although they desire to
escape the judgment of God, the testimony of their own conscience binds and
holds them fast, so that it is vain for them to cavil or seek an excuse. He
speaks in the first person, as if he were one of the great body of the people.
This is very customary; but at the same time he shows that this evil prevails
through the whole body to such an extent that not one member is whole or sound;
and, although he may plead his own cause before God, yet, because iniquity is
diffused through every part of the body, he acknowledges that he is one of the
diseased members and is infected by the general contagion. Nor is there any
contradiction in having formerly spoken of himself as not sharing the general
guilt, and now laying aside all distinction, and including himself along with
others.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have done wickedly.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Here he enumerates certain classes of sins, in
order to arouse the people more keenly to an acknowledgment of their sin. It
must be regarded as monstrous, that men, who have been chastised and almost
crushed by the hand of God, are still proud, and so obstinate that they cannot
bend or be humbled by a conviction of their sin. The Lord endeavors to soften
our obduracy by stripes and wounds; but when chastisements do us no good, our
case must be given up as hopeless. Isaiah therefore labors to show how wretched
is the condition of the people, who, while they endured severe hardships, yet
murmured against God, and did not suffer themselves to be brought into a state
of obedience. And therefore he frequently repeats this warning, and reproves
sharply, in order to subdue this obstinacy of the
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And we have lied to
Jehovah. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By a variety of terms he rebukes their
vices, and enumerates classes of them, after having pointed out in a general
manner that corruption which everywhere prevailed.: Nor does he mention only
slight faults, or those of a small number of persons, but a universal revolt. By
these words he pronounces them to have been so deeply corrupted, that no
sincerity, uprightness, fear, or conscience remained in them. For what is meant
by "lying to God," but to revolt treacherously from him, as if all obedience
were refused? Thus he does not reproach them with one or a few transgressions of
the Law, but says that, like fugitives, they have forsaken God, so that they do
not follow him when he
calls.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Conceiving and uttering
from the heart. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He now adds that they were
devoted to the invention of mischief, and thoroughly imbued with falsehood; for
"to utter a lie from the heart," is far worse than to tell lies thoughtlessly,
or even to deceive when an occasion presents itself. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F985</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Nor is there any room to doubt that those reproofs grievously offended the Jews,
who, puffed up with pride, imagined that they were exceedingly holy. But it was
proper to treat their hypocrisy in this manner, because mere doctrine produced
little effect upon them. Taught by this example, pastors, when they see the
Church of God corrupt, and men pleasing themselves and flattering their vices,
ought to make strenuous opposition, accompanied by loud and sharp
reproof.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And judgment is driven back.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">It is a mistake to suppose that the Prophet
returns to his earliest subject,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:5) and speaks of the punishments which the people had suffered at the hand of
God; for he still proceeds with the preceding narrative, and explains the
diseases under which the people labored, that they may see clearly that they are
justly punished. But we must distinguish this verse from the ninth, in which he
said that "judgment had gone back;" for there he declared that they were
deprived of God's assistance, because they did not deserve to have him as the
defender of their cause; but here he says that "judgment is driven back" in a
different sense, that is, because they have overthrown all justice and equity
among themselves. They have therefore received a just reward, because no justice
of God has shone forth to render assistance, when they have banished far from
them justice and equity; for in vain do we expect from God what we have refused
to others and cast away from
ourselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the street.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">That is, in a public place. He describes those
places in which judicial sentences were pronounced. When he says that "truth is
fallen in the street," he means that not only some private individuals have been
corrupted, but the whole condition of the people is so thoroughly depraved as to
leave no part sound; for, if some vices reign among the common people, some
remedy may be obtained, so long as there is room for judgment; but if judgments
are overthrown or corrupted, it follows that all things are infected by a
universal contagion. He describes also their unbridled licentiousness, in not
being ashamed of conduct openly wicked, and in not shrinking from the light and
from the eyes of men.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Truth faileth.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Hence it clearly appears that Isaiah, in the
preceding verse, did not speak of punishments; for, without interrupting the
stream of his discourse, he proceeds to show that the people ought not to
complain of the severity of chastisements, since they have so grievously
offended and provoked God. He therefore confirms what he formerly said, that
"truth hath fallen, that there is no place for equity;" and he enlarges this
statement the more, by adding that <i>he who hath withdrawn from evil hath
become a prey.</i> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F986</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Almost all the Jewish expositors, reading the two clauses consecutively, explain
them thus: &#8212; "Truth hath failed, and, by departing from evil, hath been
made a prey." Why they adopt that meaning, I do not
see.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Jerome's exposition, which I follow, is
much more correct; and appropriate; and a similar mode of expression is
frequently employed in the Scriptures. Job is said to have been</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"an upright and perfect
man, fearing</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">God, and departing
from evil."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;180101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Job
1:1)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Solomon also says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"The fool is confident,
but the righteous man looketh well to himself, and departeth from evil."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;201416&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Proverbs
14:16)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet means that all uprightness was so greatly
abhorred, that the true worshippers of God, if any remained, were not permitted
to be safe. As if he had said, "Whoever wishes to live among men must vie with
them in wickedness," 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F987</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
according to the common proverb, "Among wolves we must howl; but he who wishes
to live innocently shall be torn in pieces, as a sheep is torn by wolves."
Finally, he describes the utmost pitch of wickedness; for he shows that "truth
hath failed," so that no good man is allowed to remain among them; because every
one that abstains front acts of injustice "lays himself open to be a
prey."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jehovah saw.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">This relates to the consolation of the people;
for he declares that, although they have grievously offended, so that it may
appear as if there were no room for pardon, still the Lord will have regard to
his people, and, although he has inflicted very severe chastisements, will at
length remember his covenant, so as to bring incredible relief by healing their
wounds. He speaks here of a future period, and promises that one day, after
calamities so numerous and diversified, the Lord will aid the people that are
left; for the Jews would have lost heart, and would have been altogether
discouraged, if the Lord had not brought that
consolation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Thus men commonly rush forward, and
throw themselves headlong into opposite vices; for, when they are reproved, they
either grow obstinate and harden themselves, or are terrified and fall into
despair. We must therefore observe carefully this order which the Prophet
followed. First, it was necessary to reprove the Jews, that, being affected and
laid low by repentance, they might cease to find fault with God; and, secondly,
a mitigation of punishments, accompanied by salvation, is promised, that they
might not be discouraged, but expect assistance from the Lord, who is unwilling
that his Church should perish, and punishes his people for a time, in order that
he may not suffer them to be ruined and
destroyed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet if any one prefer to limit this
dislike or displeasure of God to the "judgment," because he had good reason for
abhorring a wicked people, I have no objection; as if he had said that God saw
nothing in that people but what was ground of hatred. Hence it follows, that
there was no other motive that prompted him to yield assistance, than because
their affairs were utterly desperate.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He saw that there was no man.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Isaiah continues the same subject, but
expresses more, and relates more fully what he had briefly noticed; for what he
said in the preceding verse, that "it displeased the Lord that there was no
judgment," might have been obscure. In this passage he repeats that the Lord saw
that "there was no man"  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F988</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to render assistance to the Church, and that he <i>wondered. </i>He makes use of
the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;mwt&ccedil;y</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>yishtomem</i>) in the Hithpahel conjugation,  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F989</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for the purpose of denoting that the Lord was the cause of his own astonishment;
as if he had said, "He made himself
astonished."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He wondered that
none came forward. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Some think that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[ygpm</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>maphgiang</i>) means an intercessor; but I think that the meaning is this,
that there was none who endeavored to relieve their affliction, that there was
no physician who applied his hand to this wound, and that for this reason God
"wondered." The reason why he attributes to God this astonishment may be easily
understood. By this rebuke he intended to put the Jews to shame, that they might
not, according to their custom, resort to hypocritical pretenses for concealing
their sins; and, because it was incredible and monstrous that there was not
found in a holy and elect people any one that opposed injustice, he represents
God as astonished at such a novelty, that the Jews may at length be ashamed and
repent. Was it possible that there could be greater obstinacy of which they
ought to be ashamed, since by their wickedness they moved God to
astonishment?</font><br><font face="Palatino">At the same time he rebukes their
hypocrisy, if they pretend to have eminent piety and holiness, when God, after a
diligent search, did not find even one upright man. He likewise praises and
magnifies the unspeakable mercy of God, in condescending to rescue, as if from
the depths of hell, a people whose condition was so desperate; for the Jews were
undoubtedly reminded by these words in what manner they ought to hope for
redemption; namely, because God is pleased to rise up miraculously to save what
was lost. Besides, by the word "wonder" he describes also God's fatherly care.
It is certain that God is not liable to those passions, so as to wonder at
anything as new or uncommon; but he accommodates himself to us, in order that,
being deeply moved by a conviction of our evils, we may view our condition with
horror. Thus, when he says that "the Lord saw," he means that there is no help
in our own industry; when he says that the Lord "wonders," he means that we are
excessively dull and stupid, because we neither perceive nor care for the evils
of our condition; and yet that our indifference does not prevent the Lord from
rendering assistance to his
Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore his arm

<i>made)</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> salvation to him.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">By these words he means that we ought not to
despair, although we receive no assistance from men. Yet, reducing to nothing
every other assistance, he pronounces the salvation of his own nation, and
consequently of all mankind, to be owing, from first to last, to God's
undeserved goodness and absolute power. Thus, in like manner as, by asserting
that God is abundantly sufficient for himself, and has power and strength
sufficient to redeem the Jews, he stretches out his hand to the feeble; so, by
saying that men can do nothing to promote their salvation, he abases all pride,
that, being stripped of confidence in their works, they may approach to God. And
we must observe this design of the Prophet; for, in reading the Prophets and
Apostles, we must not merely consider what they say, but for what purpose, and
with what design. Here, therefore, we ought chiefly to observe the design of the
Prophet, that in God alone is there sufficient power for accomplishing our
salvation, that we may not look hither and thither; for we are too much disposed
to lean on external aids; but that we ought to place the hope of salvation
nowhere else than on the arm of God, and that the true foundation of the Church
is in his righteousness, and that they do wrong who depend on anything else;
since God has borrowed nothing from any but
himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The usefulness of this doctrine is
still more extensive; for, although all remedies often fail us, yet the Lord
will find sufficient assistance in his own arm. Whenever, therefore, we are
destitute of men's assistance, and are overwhelmed by calamities of every kind,
and see nothing before us but ruin, let us betake ourselves to this doctrine,
and let us rest assured that God is sufficiently powerful to defend us; and,
since he has no need of the assistance of others, let us learn to rely firmly
and confidently on his aid.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet we must keep in
remembrance the universal doctrine, namely, that the redemption of the Church is
a wonderful blessing bestowed by God alone, that we may not ascribe anything to
the strength or industry of men. With abhorrence we ought to regard the pride of
those who claim for themselves any part of that praise which belongs to God,
since in him alone is found both the cause and the effect of our
salvation.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And his
righteousness, it upheld him. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Here <i>arm
</i>denotes power and strength, and righteousness denotes the integrity which he
displays in procuring the salvation of his people, when he is their protector,
and delivers them from destruction.  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F990</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
When he says that "the arm of God brought to him salvation," this must not be
limited to God, and ought not to be taken passively, as if God saved himself,
but, actively; so that this salvation refers to the Church, which he has
delivered from the bands of enemies.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he put on righteousness
as a coat of mail. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Here he equips God with his
armor, for the purpose both of confirming more and more the confidence of
believers, and of stripping all men of all confidence in their own strength. The
meaning of the verse amounts to this, that God is in want of nothing for
discomfiting his enemies and gaining the victory; because from his
righteousness, power, and grace, and from his ardent love of his people, he will
make for himself
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">panopli&gt;an</font><font face="Palatino">
complete armor. And this is again worthy of remark; for, although we acknowledge
that God is sufficiently powerful, yet we are not satisfied with it, but at. the
same time seek other help. Thus our minds are always inclined to unbelief, so
that they fasten on inferior means, and are greatly entangled by
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In order to correct this vice, Isaiah
presents this lively description; as if he had said, "Know ye that God has in
his hand all the safeguards of your salvation, and will be in want of nothing to
deliver you in spite of enemies and bring you back to your native country; and
therefore there is no reason why you should tremble." Besides, there is nothing
to which we are more prone than to imagine that we bestow something on God, and
thus to claim for ourselves some part of the praise which ought to remain
undivided with him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">When he clothes God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with vengeance, and with
indignation as a cloak</i></font><font face="Palatino">, this relates to
enemies, against whom God is said to be enraged for the sake of his people; and
thus, the more that Satan labors and makes every effort against us, so much the
more does God kindle with zeal, and so much the more powerfully does he rise up,
to render assistance to us. Although, therefore, Satan and all the reprobate do
not rest, but raise up obstacles of every kind to prevent our salvation, and
even exert themselves furiously to destroy us, yet, by his power alone, God will
defeat all their efforts.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As if on account of
recompenses. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He confirms the statement of the
preceding verse; for he shows what will be the nature of that vengeance with
which he had clothed the Lord; namely, that he is prepared to render recompense
to his enemies. We must attend to the reason why the Prophet describes the Lord
as thus armed, indignant, and ready for vengeance. It is, because the salvation
of the Church is connected with the destruction of the wicked; and therefore God
must be armed against the enemies who wish to destroy
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we see God's infinite love toward us,
who loves us so ardently that he bears hostility to our enemies, and declares
that he will render recompense to them. So strong is his affection to his little
flock, that he sets a higher value on them than on the whole world. This is the
reason why he says that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he will
render recompense to the islands</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, to
countries beyond the sea and far off; for, in order to deliver his people, he
overthrew monarchies that were powerful, and that appeared to be invincible.
But, although here he mentions none but mortal men, still we must begin with
Satan, who is their head.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore they shall fear the
name of Jehovah. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He now testifies that this
work of redemption shall be so splendid and illustrious, that the whole world
shall wonder, behold, praise, and celebrate, and, struck with fear, shall render
glory to God. It is uncertain whether he means the conversion of the Gentiles,
or the terror with which God dismays his enemies. For my own part, I am more
inclined to the former opinion, that, even to the utmost boundaries of the
earth, the name of God shall be revered and honored, so that the Gentiles shall
not only tremble, but shall serve and adore him with true
repentance.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For
</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F991</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the enemy shall come as a river.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">As to the reason now assigned, commentators
differ. But the true meaning, in my opinion, is, that the attack of the enemy
shall be so furious that, like a rapid and impetuous torrent, it shall appear to
sweep away and destroy everything, but that the Lord shall cause it instantly to
subside and disappear. It is therefore intended to heighten the description of
the divine power, by which the vast strength and dreadful fury of the enemies
are repelled, receive a different direction, and fall to
pieces.</font><br><font face="Palatino">A question now arises, "What redemption
does the Prophet mean?" I reply, as I have already suggested on another passage,
that these promises ought not to be limited, as is commonly done, to a single
redemption; for the Jews refer it, exclusively to the deliverance from Babylon,
while Christians refer it to Christ alone. For my part, I join both, so as to
include the whole period after the return of the people along with that which
followed down to the coming of Christ; for this prophecy was not fulfilled but
in Christ, and what is said here cannot apply to any other. Never was the glory
of God revealed to the whole world, nor were his enemies put to flight so as not
to recover their strength, till Christ achieved a conquest and illustrious
triumph over Satan, sin, and death.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And a Redeemer shall come to
Zion. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He again confirms what he formerly said,
that the people shall be delivered, and that God will be the author of this
blessing. He bids the people, therefore, be of good cheer in their captivity,
which shall not be perpetual; and next, he exhorts them to place the hope of
redemption in God alone, that they may fix their minds solely on his promises.
By the name Zion he denotes here, as in other passages, captives and exiles; for
however far they had been banished from their country, still they must have
carried the temple in their
hearts.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And to them who have
turned away from iniquity. </i></font><font face="Palatino">That the bastard
children of Abraham may not apply indiscriminately to themselves what he has
just now said, he proceeds to show to whom the redemption shall come, namely, to
those only who have been truly consecrated to the Lord. It is certain that many
returned from Babylon, who were not moved by any feeling of repentance, and yet
who became partakers of the same blessing. But the Prophet speaks of the
complete redemption which the elect alone enjoy; for, although the fruit of
external redemption extends also to hypocrites, yet they have not embraced the
blessing of God for salvation. The design of the Prophet is, to show that the
punishment; of banishment will be advantageous, that God may gather his Church,
after having purified it from filth and pollution; for we must always bear in
remembrance what we saw elsewhere as to the diminution of the
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In this way the Prophet exhorts the
elect to the fear of God, that they may profit by his chastisements. Hence
infer, that we cannot be reconciled to God through the blood of Christ, unless
we first repent of our sins; not that salvation, which is founded on the pardon
of sins, depends on our repentance; but repentance is joined to it in such a
manner that it cannot be separated. They whom the Lord receives into favor are
renewed by his Spirit in such a manner as to abhor their vices and change their
manner of life.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Papists overturn the whole
doctrine of salvation, by mingling and confounding pardon of sin with
repentance; and not only they, but others also who wish to be thought more
acute.  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F992</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
They acknowledge that a man is justified by free grace through Christ, but add,
that it is because we are renewed by him. Thus they make our justification to
depend partly on the pardon of sins and partly on repentance. But in this way
our consciences will never be pacified; for we are very far from being perfectly
renewed. These things must, therefore, be distinguished, so as to be neither
separated nor confounded; and thus our salvation will rest; on a solid
foundation.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Paul quotes this passage,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451126&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:26) in order to show that there is still some remaining hope among the Jews;
although from their unconquerable obstinacy it might be inferred that they were
altogether cast off and doomed to eternal death. But because God is continually
mindful of his covenant, and "his gifts and calling are without repentance,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451129&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:29) Paul justly concludes that it is impossible that there shall not at
length be some remnant that come to Christ, and obtain that salvation which he
has procured. Thus the Jews must at length be collected along with the Gentiles,
that out of both "there may be one fold" under Christ.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431016&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
10:16) It is of the deliverance from Babylon, however, that the Prophet treats.
This is undoubtedly true; but we have said that he likewise includes the kingdom
of Christ, and spiritual redemption, to which this prediction relates. Hence we
have said that Paul infers that he could not be the redeemer of the world,
without belonging to some Jews, whose fathers he had chosen, and to whom this
promise was directly
addressed.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Saith Jehovah.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">By these words, in the conclusion of the verse,
he sets a seal to the excellent sentiment which he has
expressed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I make this my covenant
with them. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Because it was difficult to believe
what the Prophet has hitherto declared, therefore he endeavors, in various ways,
to confirm the Jews, that they may rely with unshaken confidence on this promise
of salvation, and may ascribe to God so much honor as to trust in his word. And
we ought carefully to observe the word <i>covenant, </i>by which the Prophet
points out the greatness and excellence of this promise; for the promises are
more extensive, and may be regarded as the stones of the building, while the
foundation of it is the covenant, which upholds the whole mass. He makes use of
this word, therefore, that they might not think that it contained some matter of
ordinary occurrence, and adds these confirmations, that, although the Lord did
not immediately perform this, they might nevertheless expect it with firm and
unshaken hope; and there appears to be an implied contrast, that believers may
cheerfully look forward to the new covenant, which was to be established in the
hand of Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My Spirit that
is upon thee, and my words. </i></font><font face="Palatino">What is now added
may be thought to be feeble and trivial, when he enjoins the Church to be
satisfied with the "word" and "Spirit; " as if this were a great happiness, to
hang in suspense on nothing but God's promises. Yet although the Prophet
commends the value and excellence of doctrine, I have no doubt that still it is
not separated from its effect. But because God regulates and dispenses his grace
in such a manner, that, as long as believers remain in this world, he always
trains them to patience, and does not in every instance answer their prayers,
therefore he brings them back to doctrine; as if he had said, "Thou wilt indeed
find that I am kind to thee in various ways; but. there is no happiness which
will be of greater importance to thee, or which thou oughtest to desire more
earnestly, than to feel that I am present by ' the word' and 'the Spirit.'"
Hence we infer that this is a most valuable treasure of the Church, that he has
chosen for himself a habitation in it, to dwell in the hearts of believers by
his Spirit, and next to preserve among them the doctrine of his
gospel.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall not depart out
of thy mouth. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Finally, he foretells that the
Lord will never forsake his people, but will always be present with them by "his
Spirit" and by "the word." The "Spirit" is joined with the word, because,
without the efficacy of the Spirit, the preaching of the gospel would avail
nothing, but would remain unfruitful. In like manner, "the word" must not be
separated from "the Spirit," as fanatics imagine, who, despising the word, glory
in the name of the Spirit, and swell with vain confidence in their own
imaginations. It is the spirit of Satan that is separated from the word, to
which the Spirit of God is continually joined. Now, when he quickens outward
doctrine, so that it strikes root in our hearts, our condition is happy even
amidst many afflictions; and I have no doubt that the Prophet expressly declares
that, although God deals kindly with his Church, still its life and salvation
shall be laid up in faith. Thus the new people is distinguished from the ancient
people; for, as the kingdom of Christ is spiritual, so, since he has risen from
the dead, believing souls must be raised up along with him. But now he promises
that the Church will never be deprived of this invaluable blessing, but will be
guided by the Holy Spirit and sustained by heavenly doctrine; for it would be of
little avail that the gospel should once be offered to us, and that the Spirit
should be given to us, if he did not dwell with
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which I have put in thy
mouth. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet shows that God addresses us
in such a manner that he chooses to employ the ministry and agency of men. He
might indeed speak from heaven or send angels; but he has consulted our
advantage the more by addressing and exhorting us through men like ourselves,
that, by their voice and word, he may more gently draw us to himself. This order
has therefore been established by him in the Church, that it is vain for those
who reject his ministers to boast that they are willing to obey God; and
therefore he commands us to seek the word and doctrine from the mouth of
prophets and teachers, who teach in his name and by his authority, that we may
not foolishly hunt after new
revelations.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My words shall
not depart. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The phrase, "shall not depart," is
rendered by some in the imperative mood, for which it is well known that the
future tense is sometimes used. But here a command or exhortation is not
appropriate; for the Prophet promises that which God intends to fulfill. An
exhortation may indeed be drawn from it, but the priority is due to the promise,
which is to this effect, that the Lord will assist his Church, and will take
care of it, so as never to allow it to be deprived of doctrine. To this,
therefore, we ought always to look, when we are tempted by adversity, and when
everything does not succeed according to our wish; for we must be supported and
upheld by the word and the Spirit, of which the Lord declares that we shall
never be left destitute.</font><br></div>

52:1) Thus, by what may be called the stretching out of his hand, he lifts up
the Church again, that she who had formerly been prostrated, and covered all
over with filth and pollution, may regain her seat of
honor.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thy brightness is
come. </i></font><font face="Palatino">That the darkness of afflictions may not
overwhelm the Jews with despair, he says that the light which had been hidden
would soon afterwards arise, alluding to the alternation of day and night. As if
he had said, "The Lord, having compassion upon thee, will rescue thee out of
this darkness in which thou liest; thou hast been sufficiently punished; it is
time that thy condition should begin to be improved." By the word <i>brightness,
</i>therefore, he metaphorically denotes salvation and prosperity, as by
"darkness" he formerly denoted a calamitous state of the
Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The glory of Jehovah.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He mentions at the same that this light will
arise from no other quarter than from God's smiling countenance, when he shall
be pleased to display his grace; for everything goes well when the Lord shines
upon us by his light; and, when he turns away from us, nothing that can befall
us is more wretched and unhappy.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For, behold, darkness shall
cover the earth. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He now exhibits in a stronger
light, by means of comparison, that grace which he formerly mentioned; that we
may form some idea how much God loves his elect, and how extraordinary is the
privilege which he bestows upon them. The amount of what he says is, that, while
we are weighed down by innumerable afflictions, and while the whole world, as it
were, sinks under them, God will take care of his people., in order to enrich
them with various benefits. He shows, therefore, that the light of grace and
favor, which he mentioned, will not be indiscriminately enjoyed by all, but will
be peculiar to the people of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We have said
that the word "brightness" denotes a prosperous condition of the Church; but let
us not judge of this condition from outward appearance; for the Prophet rises
higher, and I have no doubt that his discourse relates to spiritual light and
brightness. Otherwise that mode of expression which he afterwards employs, "The
Gentiles shall walk to thy brightness," (verse 3) would not be appropriate.
Besides, this is clearly demonstrated by the connection between this chapter and
the preceding; for he says that this covenant is continued in the word and
Spirit. Finally, from the contrast it may easily be inferred that the happiness
promised to the Church is different from that which consists in meat and drink,
or tranquillity and peace, and other conveniences; and indeed never afterwards
was there any period in which the darkness of afflictions overwhelmed all the
Gentiles, while the Jews enjoyed peace and prosperity. Since, therefore, the
condition of the Church is separated from the whole world, that benefit which
Isaiah puts into the possession of the Church is spiritual, and the brightness
which he promises is spiritual; and consequently, these things relate to the
spiritual kingdom of Christ, when the light of the Gospel shone in every part of
the world, and foreign nations were enlightened by it. To this also relates what
follows, &#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord will
arise upon thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for although he shows that the
favor of God will be visible by manifest tokens and effects, yet he does not
leave out that which is of the greatest importance, that believers will truly
feel that he is their Father, so as to expect salvation from him. Hence infer
that we are overwhelmed by darkness till God shine upon us with the testimony of
adoption by free grace. I speak of all mankind; for Isaiah informs us that this
life-giving light proceeds from God alone, in order to declare that it is a
special gift of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Secondly, it ought to be
observed that the Church alone, that is, the elect of God, are partakers of this
brightness. Hence it follows, that it is not a common or natural gift, but a
gift by which the Lord relieves us from an ordinary defect of human nature. Thus
also we perceive that there is no light or brightness but in the Church; for the
rest of men, though they think that they enjoy light and brightness, are
overwhelmed by darkness, from which they cannot be extricated in any other way
than by the light of the
Gospel.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And his glory shall be
seen upon thee. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He adds the word "glory,"
because, after having embraced us by his favor, the Lord continues more and more
to increase his acts of kindness toward
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Gentiles shall walk.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He confirms what we have already said, that
there is no other light of men but when the Lord shines on them by his word. All
indeed acknowledge this; but they do not set so high a value as they ought on
this benefit, and imagine it to be something of an ordinary kind, which
naturally belongs to all men. But he shows that this grace is supernatural, and
therefore it ought to be distinguished from nature; which is clearly shown by
the repetition of the words upon thee, in the preceding
verse.</font><br><font face="Palatino">First, then, we ought to believe that
this benefit comes from God alone; and secondly, that all are not
indiscriminately partakers of it, but only the elect, on whom the Lord shines by
undeserved favor, so as to take them out of the ordinary rank of men. This is
done by Christ, who is called "the Sun of Righteousness," because we are
enlightened as if by his rays.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;390402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
4:2) Besides, the Prophet declares that this favor shall be spread far and wide
by the Jews; which is also intimated by the words of the
covenant,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To thy brightness.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">If one nation only had enjoyed the light, it
would have been of no advantage to the rest; but, so far as the doctrine of the
Gospel has been spread throughout the whole world, Judea has held out the light
to the Gentiles formerly blinded, in order to point out the way. By making the
brightness peculiar to a single nation, he shows that in no other way could the
world be enlightened, or come to share in this benefit, than by seeking light
from that word which proceeded from the Jews, and was heard at Jerusalem, where
the lamp of the Lord was kindled, and where the Sun of Righteousness arose, that
from it he might diffuse his light to all the ends of the earth, as we have
formerly seen, "Out of Zion shall go forth the Law."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
2:3) There is, therefore, no light but from the doctrine of the prophets; so
that they who withdraw from it falsely boast of walking in the
light.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And kings to the
brightness of thy rising. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He alludes to the
dawn; for, as the morning-star begins the day in one quarter only of heaven, and
immediately the sun enlightens the whole world, so the daybreak was first in
Judea, from which the light arose and was afterwards diffused throughout the
whole world; for there is no corner of the earth which the Lord has not
enlightened by this light. He mentions "kings," that they might not imagine that
none but the common people would come to this light, but princes and nobles, who
in other respects are greatly delighted with their high rank. But now he confers
on the Church the very highest honor, that she shines with such brightness as to
attract to herself nations and princes. He calls it "the light" of the Church;
not that she has any light from herself, but borrows it from Christ, as the moon
borrows from the sun.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lift up thine eyes round
about. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By a variety of expressions he confirms
that promise of the restoration of the Church which appeared to be altogether
incredible. Nor was it easy to convince the Jews of this, while the state of
their affairs was so wretched and confused. At that time the kingdom of Judah
alone remained, and grew less every day, till it was utterly ruined; but when
the people were led into captivity amidst that frightful dispersion and
melancholy ruin, everything was so desperate that it appeared as if the Church
were entirely ruined. It was therefore proper to confirm this doctrine by a
variety of expressions, that hearts naturally prone to distrust might no longer
doubt. For this reason he leads the Jews to look at the event as actually at
hand, though it was at a great distance; that they might not hesitate any more
than if it were already placed before their
eyes.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He bids believers lift, up their eyes on
high, that is, above human thought; for, so long as we fix them on the outward
condition, we cannot obtain the fruit of these promises. He adds, "round about,"
that they may fully believe that the nations will come, not from one quarter
only, but from every direction, that they may be united in one body. And not
only does he promise a remedy and an end of the dispersion which was yet to take
place, as it is said elsewhere, "He will gather the dispersed of Israel,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19E702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
147:2;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235608&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
56:8) but this gathering is more extensive; for it means that there will be a
wonderful revolution in the world, so that they who formerly were strangers and
dispersed shall be united in one body. Finally, it denotes the extension of the
Church to the farthest boundaries of the earth. There is also an implied
contrast, by which he points out the wretched and afflicted condition in which
the world was, before it was gathered together under the direction of
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy sons shall come
from far. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Some think that by "sons" are meant
those who are stronger and more steadfast in faith, and by daughters those who
are weaker. But I do not think that the Prophet intended to convey such
ingenious distinctions;  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F994</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and therefore I consider the plain meaning to be, that both sons and daughters
shall run together to the Church; that is, that the Church shall have sons and
daughters, not only at home but abroad, and in the most distant parts of the
world; that the womb of the Church shall not be limited to any corner of the
world, but shall be extended as far and wide as there shall be space throughout
the whole world.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then shalt thou see.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">These things appear, at first sight, to be
somewhat inconsistent with each other, that formerly he spoke of the fact as
present, and now foretells it as future. But formerly he spoke of the eyes of
faith, which beholds those things which do not fall under the senses of men, and
now he speaks of the actual event; or, at least, he intended by the present
tense to point out the certainty; but now, in order that believers may continue
to exercise patience, he limits the same statement. Besides, although those
things which the Lord promises are concealed, for a time, from the eyes of men,
yet believers perceive them by faith; so that they have a firm belief and
expectation of the accomplishment of them, however incredible they may appear to
others.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt shine,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">or, <i>thou shalt overflow. </i>As the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rhn</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>nahar</i>) signifies both "to shine" and "to overflow," so it may be
rendered either way.  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F995</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
We may refer it to that joy with which the Church is filled and overflows, when
it is enlarged in this manner, or to the ornament with which it shines and
dazzles.  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F996</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou
shalt tremble. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He now mentions "trembling," and
connects it with splendor or joy; and this may appear to be inconsistent with
the meaning assigned to the former clause. But I have no doubt that he intended,
by this word, to express the astonishment and even amazement with which the
Church shall be seized, when she shall perceive that this strange and unexpected
honor has been obtained by her, and that she has been elevated to so high a rank
of honor. As if he had said, "The extent of the work will be so great as to
exceed thy expectation." It is not, therefore, the "trembling"' which is
produced by some danger or some melancholy event, but such as commonly arises in
matters of great importance, which exceed the capacity of our understanding,
when we are struck with amazement, and almost think that we dream, and this
"trembling" agrees very well with joy.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A multitude of camels shall
cover thee. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet describes figuratively
the glory of the Church, and accommodates his discourse to the time, and to the
persons with whom he had to do. We must keep in remembrance what we have often
said, that the prophets took into account the people whom they taught, and
therefore mentioned customary transactions and well-known ceremonies, that,
under the figures of them, they might describe the spiritual worship of God. The
Jews must be first instructed, and afterwards the Gentiles, to whom the truth of
those things has come; as if he had said, that nations far distant shall come,
with their wealth, into the power of God; for, when he foretells that the Church
shall be enriched, this must not be understood as referring to the persons of
men; but, on account of the unity of the Head and the members, what belongs to
God and to Christ is transferred to the Church. Foolishly, therefore, do the
Jews, under the pretense of this prophecy, devour with their insatiable avarice
all the riches of the earth; and not less absurdly do the Papists torture these
words to support their luxuries, wealth, and
magnificence.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He mentions "camels, frankincense,
gold., and sheep," because he has in his eye what each country produces, in
order to show that all will consecrate to God whatever they shall have in their
power, and will offer themselves and all that they have as a sacrifice. Hence it
ought to be inferred, that we cannot be truly converted to the Lord, without
offering to him all our faculties; for these are "spiritual sacrifices,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600205&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 2:5) which he demands, and which cannot be refused to him, if our hearts
be dedicated and consecrated to him in sincerity.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
12:1) Wicked men abuse the gifts of God for luxury and intemperance, and corrupt
them, as far as lies in their power, by unworthy profanation; but good men, by
using them with a pure conscience, dedicate them to the Lord. No one, therefore,
can belong to God without dedicating and devoting to him all that he
has.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Kedar, Nebaioth.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">So far as relates to the countries which the
Prophet here enumerates, it is unnecessary to explain in what place each of them
is situated; but it ought to be observed, in passing, that he mentions here
those countries which lay toward the East, and chiefly Arabia and neighboring
places, which he describes under the names of "Kedar" and "Nebaioth." The
Papists have also abused this passage, in order to prove that kings came from
the East to offer gifts to Christ; and, in so doing, they make themselves
exceedingly ridiculous, seeing that the Prophet speaks of all ranks of men. But
they heap up, without judgment, all passages of this kind, in which mention is
made of "gold" or "frankincense," as if the prophets meant those gifts which the
magi offered.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
2:11) But in this passage there is no obscurity; for it means that everywhere
men shall call upon God, and all foreigners shall assemble to worship
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall ascend to the
good pleasure of my altar. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Others render the
words, "They shall ascend with good pleasure on my altar," and think (not
altogether without reason, in my opinion) that it is a figure of speech by which
words interchange their cases with each other, and that. the Prophet means that
those sacrifices which shall be offered by the Gentiles will be acceptable to
God. Others interpret
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wxr</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>ratzon</i>) as if it were an adjective, which does not agree with the
correct use of the language; for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wxr</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>ratzon</i>) signifies benevolence or favor. For this reason I consider the
rendering which I have given to be preferable; namely, that "sacrifices shall
ascend to the good pleasure of the altar;" and the meaning may be brought out in
this manner, "They shall ascend to appease God; as it is for this purpose that
an altar has been appointed, and sacrifices are offered, that God may be
reconciled and favorable to men; and God also, according to his promise, accepts
the sacrifices that have been offered on his altar;" for at that time the
"altar" was the approach to obtain God's
favor.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here the Prophet plainly expresses three
things. First, when he says that "the sacrifices ascend," he alludes to the
ancient ceremony, which was formerly observed by them in sacrifices; for they
lifted up the slain beasts; by which they meant that all men ought to raise
their hearts on high, that they might not keep their eyes fixed on the earth or
look only at the sacrifice which was offered. Secondly, the Prophet says that
those sacrifices are acceptable to God, that they may be distinguished from the
profane offerings of the Gentiles, which were unaccompanied by faith. Thirdly,
he says, "On the altar," which alone can "sanctify the offerings,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402319&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
23:19; ) for all that was offered anywhere else was unholy and detestable.
Besides, this figure ought to lead us to the truth; for Christ is the altar of
God, and on him we must offer, if we wish that God should accept our
sacrifices.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will glorify
the house of my glory. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Under the glorification
of the temple he declares the true restoration of the people; for the chief part
of their happiness was, that the temple should stand, in which men called on God
in a right manner; and we must begin with this, that God reigns amongst us, by
which we are made truly happy. For this reason, when the Lord declares that the
Church shall be restored, he mentions the temple, the glory of which he will
restore; as if he had said, "My house is now exposed to the mockery of the
Gentiles, but I will at length restore to it that glory of which it has now been
deprived." It is evident from Zechariah, Haggai, and Malachi, that this was not
completed immediately after the return of the people. We must not imagine that
its true dignity consisted in that splendid building by which Herod cunningly
endeavored to gain favor; and therefore the dignity or honor, which is here
mentioned, was not manifested till God opened the gate of heaven to Jerusalem,
and then openly called all the Gentiles to the hope of eternal
salvation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who are those?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">As the Prophet cannot satisfy himself in
describing this gift of God, he breaks out into admiration, and exclaims, "Who
are those? " This is far more forcible than if he had simply said that an
inconceivable multitude was flying, and had even made use of the same metaphors.
He intended, therefore, to describe how splendid this multiplication would be,
when he could not find words sufficient to express
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That fly as a cloud.
</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F997</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It is generally thought that this denotes the Apostles, who, with incredible
swiftness, made their way to the farthest boundaries of the world; and there is
some plausibility in that interpretation.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;411615&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
16:15) But the Prophet speaks of a universal assemblage of the Church; for from
every quarter men shall run to it readily and
cheerfully.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And as doves to
their windows</i></font><font face="Palatino">.  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F998</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The metaphor of "doves," which he employs, is highly appropriate to this
subject; for, when they are dispersed through the fields, they appear not to
differ at all from untamed birds; and yet they are domesticated, and have their
pigeon-house, to which they betake themselves, and in which they build their
nests. Thus believers, enlightened by faith, begin to perceive their assembly,
to which they fly from frightful dispersion. How necessary this warning was,
will be readily perceived by all who shall take into account their wretched and
alarming condition at that time; for, if the prophets, after having carefully
instructed the Jews for many years, could gain very little or hardly any
success, what was to be expected from the Gentiles, who were altogether
alienated from God? Was it not
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">para&gt;doxon</font><font face="Palatino">
beyond all reasonable expectation, that the Gentiles would one day come into the
Church? Yet the Prophet does not speak extravagantly, but is filled with such
amazement that he leads us to admire it in the same
manner.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Surely the islands shall wait
for me. </i></font><font face="Palatino">After having employed every eulogium
that he could find for extolling that wonderful benefit of restoration, Isaiah
introduces God himself as speaking, that the discourse may carry greater weight.
This "waiting" is supposed by some to denote desire; as if he had said that this
is done, because nations beyond the seas shall, as it were, hunger after him;
because they shall feel that they are destitute of life and salvation. Others
view it as simply denoting hope. But sometimes it likewise means "to observe,"
in which sense David employs it. "Wicked men wait for my soul;" that is, "they
lay snares for my life."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;195606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
56:6) In that sense it may be understood in this passage. "They shall wait for,"
that is, they shall observe my will; as servants are wont to comply with the
will of their masters. Do not wonder, therefore, that so many shall flow into
the Church; for "the islands," which at present sometimes despise and sometimes
fight against me, shall be so attentive to me as to execute whatever I shall
command. And indeed from the remainder of the verse it is manifest that he now
speaks of that kind of
obedience.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the ships of
Tarshish. </i></font><font face="Palatino">If it be thought preferable, the
particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">k</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>caph</i>,) <i>as, </i>may be here supplied in this manner: "As the ships of
Tarshish formerly traded with Judea, and brought what was necessary for building
the temple and for the use of men, so they shall again renew their traffic, and
that navigation which had been broken off shall bring them back to their former
course. By "Tarshish," that is, Cilicia, he means,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sunekdocikw~v</font><font face="Palatino">
by a figure of speech in which a part is taken for the whole, all the naval
intercourse and all the traffic which they carried on with foreign nations. It
may also be supposed simply to mean, "The ships of Tarshish, which now proudly
despise my Church, shall be subjected to my authority, and shall bring sons to
her from distant
countries."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their silver and
gold with them. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He again repeats what he had
formerly said, that the Gentiles shall yield obedience to God in such a manner
as to offer themselves and all that they have. The Popish doctors, as I remarked
a little before, display consummate impudence in abusing these proofs for
defending that tyrannical and theatrical  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F999</font></sup><font face="Palatino">display
by which Roman antichrist, and his attendants, wish to attain fame and
distinction. Abounding in luxury, adorning themselves with gold and jewels, and
indeed with the attire of a harlot, they are not ashamed of representing the
Holy Spirit as the author of this wickedness; so that, whenever gold and silver
are mentioned in Scripture, they apply it to their luxury. In. this respect they
certainly are very like the Jews, who rise to ecstatic delight at the mention of
gold and silver, and hope to wallow in them, when Messiah comes. Thus the
Papists think of nothing else than gold and silver, and their understandings are
so much dazzled by that empty display that they cannot raise them to heaven. But
such stupidity does not need a lengthened
refutation.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the name of
Jehovah thy God. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The general meaning is, that
God intends to elevate his Church to the highest honor, and to adorn her with
necessary ornaments. And that believers may not have their minds disturbed by
any doubt of so illustrious a promise, or ascribe anything to their own merits,
God himself promises that he will be the author of this event,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for he will glorify
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Besides, the Prophet declares that the
riches of the Gentiles, which he appeared to represent, a little before, as the
prey of the Church or the prize of victory, shall be a sacred offering to God;
and thus he states more clearly what I have said, that there is nothing which we
ought to desire more earnestly than that the whole world should bow to the
authority of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the sons of the stranger
shall build thy walls. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He continues the same
subject. As he formerly said that foreigners shall submit to his authority, in
order to build the temple; so he now says that "the sons of the stranger" shall
bestow their labor in building the walls. Various are the comparisons by which
he promises the restoration of the Church. It is customary in Scripture, when
the Church is spoken of, to exhibit sometimes the temple, and sometimes
Jerusalem. He promises that foreigners and strangers shall assist in rearing
this building, that the Jews may not be terrified by their poverty or their
small number, and consequently lose heart; for they might be tempted to distrust
during the captivity, so that, though they hoped to return to their native
country, still they might think that this could not be accomplished by
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, Cyrus accomplished it, when he
supplied them with a large amount of gold and silver. But in him these things
were merely shadowed out. They were actually fulfilled in Christ, to whose reign
they must entirely relate; for, first, Christ employed a few apostles,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;401001&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
10:1) who could not be sufficient for so great a work; but afterwards he raised
up strangers, from among whom he chose pastors, and wished that their foreign
princes should be nursing-fathers of the
Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino">With aggravated wickedness do the
Papists pervert and corrupt this passage, by torturing it to uphold the tyranny
of the Pope, whom they wish to possess supreme power over kings and princes.
They speak impudent falsehood when they say that he is Christ's deputy; for
Christ's "kingdom" is not of this world.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431836&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
18:36) The Pope rules barbarously and tyrannically, and claims the power of
changing and disposing of kingdoms. But kings submit to Christ in such a manner
that they do not cease to be kings, but exercise all their power for preserving
the worship of God and administering righteous
government.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we see how much those persons
are opposed to the kingdom of Christ who wish to snatch authority and power from
kings, that they themselves may possess it. Hence also the Anabaptists may be
refuted, who overturn political order so far as to imagine that kings cannot be
Christians in any other way than by renouncing their own authority, since even
in the royal rank God shows that he wishes to hold the highest
place.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For in my wrath I smote
thee. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Lest any one should object that it would
have been easier to preserve the Church uninjured than to raise her from hell,
God anticipates the objection, and shows that the Jews were justly afflicted in
this manner, because he had been exceedingly provoked by their offenses; but he
gives them good ground of hope, because he does not choose to demand the
punishment which they had deserved, but will be satisfied, provided that a
temporary chastisement shall humble
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In my kindness have I
had compassion on thee. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He reminds the Jews
what is the cause of this change, that they may not judge of it according to
their own apprehension. When kingdoms are changed, and frequently rise and fall,
men think that these events happen by chance, and that it is the common lot of
the world. The Jews might think the same thing, when, in consequence of the
kingdom of the Babylonians having been overturned, they were restored to
liberty. For this reason the Lord testifies that all these things are governed
by his providence; that is, that they may not shut their eyes after the manner
of heathens. It is as if he had said, "If thou inquire why thou hast endured so
many afflictions, the reason is this, that I was angry with thee and punished
thy transgressions. But if thou ask the cause of thy deliverance, my undeserved
kindness, and not thy worthiness, or an accidental occurrence, was the cause."
Accordingly, calamities do not happen by chance, nor is God angry without cause;
and he is not angry to such a degree as not to leave room for his compassion.

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thy gates shall be open
continually. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The ordinary exposition of this
verse is incorrect. The Prophet is generally supposed to mean that the Church
will be perfectly safe under the Lord's protection and guardianship; for "open
gates" indicate that danger is far off. But I think that the Prophet himself
explains it; namely, that the gates shall be open, that riches may be brought
into the city from every quarter. And as burdens are usually carried in the
daytime, "The day," he says, "will not be enough, so vast shall be the crowd of
those who bring into it precious treasures, and therefore the carrying will be
so constant that it will be necessary to keep the gates open night and day."  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1000</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">When
he says that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the riches of the
Gentiles</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>shall belong to the Church, let
us not view this as referring to carnal luxury, but to obedience, which the
whole world shall render to God in the Church; for he says that what is offered
to God belongs to the Church, because here God has nothing separate from
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That their kings may be
led. </i></font><font face="Palatino">I prefer retaining the participial form
which the Prophet employs, instead of following those who change it into a verb.
Such commentators corrupt the Prophet's meaning, who expressly added this,
because so great is the haughtiness of kings that they can scarcely endure to be
led, but. rather, relying on their power, give free scope to their inclinations,
and not only are driven along so as to be the sport of their passions, but.,
like violent torrents, drag others along with them. He shows, therefore, that
these kings, though naturally haughty and ungovernable, shall submit to the
authority of God and of the Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the nation and kingdom.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet dwells largely on confirming the
hearts of believers, that they may not doubt that the restoration shall be such
as he has described. Those events were altogether incredible; and we ourselves,
though we have obtained abundant confirmation of them from the actual event,
(for they have been made manifest to the eyes of all,) yet, unless we are guided
by the Spirit of the Lord, could hardly conceive of them in our mind. He shows,
therefore, that there is no reason why the Jews should doubt as to the
restoration of the temple, because the Gentiles will aid them to the utmost of
their power But here Isaiah looks at something higher than the building of the
visible temple; for he intends to speak of that obedience which kings and nobles
and the common people render to the Church when they promote, as far as they are
able, pure doctrine.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall
perish. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He goes still farther, and confirms his
statement the more by declaring that "the kingdoms and nations which will not
serve the Church shall be destroyed." And if so dreadful a punishment was
pronounced against those who did not aid the Church, what shall we say of the
tyrants who rush upon her with furious attack, and labor with all their might to
destroy her? If careless and slothful men do not pass unpunished, does not a
fearful vengeance await the ungodly, who disturb and overturn the work of the
Lord?</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The nations, I say,
shall be utterly destroyed. </i></font><font face="Palatino">What he had said in
the singular number he immediately repeats in the plural, in order to show that
even the whole world, if it be involved in the same guilt, shall likewise
perish; for their multitude will not be able to prevent all who are estranged
from God from perishing, and ungodly men will have no excuse for throwing
obstacles in each other's way, or for encouraging each other to impiety and
wickedness. Kings and nations are said, as we have already seen, to "serve the
Church;" not that she exercises any dominion over them, but because God has
committed to her the scepter of his word by which he
rules.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The glory of Lebanon.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Isaiah again employs the metaphor which he
formerly used, when he compared the Church of God to a building or a city. He
enumerates those things which were necessary for building, such as "the
fir-tree, the pine, and the box-tree," which grew in Lebanon, a forest
abounding, as we know, in excellent
trees.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the beauty of the
place of my holiness. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He means that all that is
excellent and beautiful in Lebanon shall be carried into the Church. But it must
be believed that these figures contain an emblematical reference to the
spiritual worship of God; for the Lord adorns his Church with the title of a
sanctuary, because he dwells in the midst of it. Yet he always alludes to the
temple, so as to accommodate himself to the time and to ordinary custom. Thus he
holds out to us the pattern of the temple which stood at Jerusalem, that under
the image of it we may contemplate the "spiritual temple,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490221&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:21) of which we are the "living stones" and the living substance.

Peter 2:5)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I will glorify
the place of my feet. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By "the place of his
feet," he means that he dwells in the temple in such a manner that his majesty
is not confined within it, (for he is not limited to so narrow a place; ) and
therefore his feet only, what may be called the smallest part, is there, that we
may ascend to heaven, and not fix our whole attention on those outward signs by
which we are instructed according to our capacity. Thus also in the
Psalm,</font><br></div>

the head.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the sons of them that
afflict thee shall come. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He continues the same
subject, for he shows how splendid will be this work of redemption; that is,
that they who persecuted or despised the Church "shall come," so as to bow down
humbly before her, and submit to her with their whole heart. By "the sons of
them that afflict her," he means the persecutors and enemies who oppressed her.
This was indeed partly fulfilled, when the Jews returned to their native
country; but that return was nothing more than a dark shadow of the deliverance
which we have obtained through Christ. These things were actually accomplished
under the reign of Christ, yet so that the full accomplishment of them may be
expected at; his second coming, as we have already said under a different
passage.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Some one will ask, "Is not this honor,
of which the Prophet speaks, excessive and greater than ought to be given to the
Church? for to bow down and prostrate ourselves are tokens of honor which no
human being ought to receive." I reply, this honor is rendered, not to the
members, but to the Head; that is, to Christ, who is worshipped in the Church;
and this worship is rendered by those who formerly hated and persecuted him. Now
we say that Christ is worshipped in the Church, not as the Papists do, who think
that the honor which they bestow on that Roman idol is rendered to Christ.  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1002</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
They for whose sake these things are said reject and despise doctrine; for
Christ is honored by those who obey his doctrine. And this is what the Prophet
means, that they who were formerly alienated from it shall heartily submit, so
as to obey Christ; for if Christ; has any majesty, it shines forth in the
doctrine which he administers by the agency of
men.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall call thee the
city of Jehovah. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The Church had formerly been
adorned with that title; but it was nearly obliterated when the city was
destroyed, the temple thrown down, and the people carried into captivity.
Jerusalem was no more, and nothing was to be seen in it but frightful
desolation; and therefore he means that it shall be restored in such a manner
that all shall acknowledge it to be the city of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Zion of the Holy One
of Israel. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He next speaks of the temple, that
all may know that this high rank is ascribed to Jerusalem on account of the
temple; that is, on account of the worship of God which the Lord established
there.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1003</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
thy having been forsaken and hated. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet
has in his eye that intermediate period which was already at hand; for, soon
after his death, the people were deprived of their heritage and led into
captivity, so that all thought that there was no remaining hope of their safety.
Lest this thought should come into the minds of believers, by which they might
be reduced to despair, "We are undone, there can be no remedy for affairs so
desperate, and we ought not to hope for a better condition," he shows that those
grievous calamities cannot prevent God from restoring them; for, although for a
time, when the Lord chastised them, they appeared to be forsaken, yet it was
easy for him to raise them again to prosperity and to a better condition than
before.</font><br><font face="Palatino">If any one object that this splendor of
the Church was not of long duration, the reply is short. Although the people
were afflicted in various ways after their return, and although even the
Christian Church did not long retain its glory, yet those things which the
Prophet foretold were fulfilled; for under the cross the glory of Christ shines
forth, so that the name of God remains, and there is a people that calls upon
him by faith. It ought also to be observed, that in consequence of our
ingratitude, we do not obtain the fruit of those promises; for we interrupt the
course of God's works, and deprive ourselves of the fruit of them by our malice.
Besides, we ought always to keep in remembrance what I have so often said, that
the Prophet does not speak of a few years or a short period, but embraces the
whole course of redemption, from the end of the captivity to the preaching of
the Gospel, and, finally, down to the end of the reign of
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt suck the milk
of the Gentiles. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He speaks of the extension of
the Church which he had formerly mentioned; but it was of great importance that
the same things should be frequently repeated, because it appeared to be
incredible that the Church, which had been reduced to calamities so great and so
numerous, would be restored and spread throughout the whole world. Her condition
was desperate; but at length, out of that slender remnant which had been, as it
were, snatched from the burning, to the great astonishment of all she was
restored, and her seed was spread far and wide through every part of the world.
And therefore it is as if he had said, "Although thou art confined within narrow
limits, and thou hast had no intercourse with the Gentiles, yet thou wilt obtain
very abundant fruit from
them."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt suck the
breast of kings. </i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1004</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
By "milk" and "breasts" he means nothing else than service and obedience, which
the Gentiles shall render to the Church for supporting her offspring; for,
having formerly said that at one birth she would bring forth innumerable
children, he now gives them milk for nourishment till they grow up. And he
speaks expressly of "kings," because it was more difficult to be believed. Here,
too, in passing, "kings" are reminded of their duty; and if they wish to
discharge it in a proper manner, they must be the servants of the Church;
otherwise the Lord will call them to account. We see also what David says of
them,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"And now, O ye kings, be
wise; and ye judges of the earth, be instructed. Serve Jehovah with fear, and
rejoice with trembling."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;190210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
2:10,11)</font><br><font face="Palatino">But we ought carefully to observe in
what manner the Church sucks "the milk" and "the breasts" of the Gentiles; for
she is not at liberty to exhaust the wealth of the whole world, but to preserve
her own condition safe and sound. What is more inconsistent with the nature of a
Church than to be an insatiable gulf, and to draw the wealth of all to herself?
Those things, therefore, must relate to her spiritual condition, that God may be
purely worshipped in her, that the ministry of the word may prosper and
flourish, and that some discipline may be maintained, which shall serve as a
bridle to restrain all. Yet let believers remember that
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;442035&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
20:35) "it is more blessed to give than to receive," and that they ought to bear
poverty so patiently as to enrich others abundantly with spiritual
benefits.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt know
that I Jehovah am thy Redeemer. </i></font><font face="Palatino">At length he
adds that what had been concealed for a time shall be made manifest, that the
Jews were not elected in vain, because they shall know by undoubted experience
that God takes care of their salvation. It may be asked, Did they not know this
even before they were led into captivity? I answer, that captivity was like the
thick darkness to which also the Prophet compared it in the beginning of this
chapter. Since, therefore, during that harsh tyranny, they could not behold
God's majesty and power, the Lord led them out into open day, not that faith
gives way amidst afflictions, but that the feeling of faith is different from
that of experience. When we appear to be ruined, faith raises itself above the
present condition and the thick darkness in which we are involved; and if God
restore us perfectly, then we see it, not by the eyes of faith, but by actual
experience. And this is the clear knowledge of which he speaks; as if he had
said, "When I shall have acted so kindly towards you, then you shall actually
know that I am your
Redeemer."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The mighty one of
Jacob. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He expressly claims the title of "the
mighty one of Jacob," because he had often shown that he was so; and not only
had Jacob experience in various ways of the power of God, but Jacob's posterity
had also known that in the power of God there was abundant protection. He
therefore calls himself the "mighty one," that they may know that God will
henceforth be to them what he formerly was to their
fathers.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">For brass I will bring
gold</font><font face="Palatino">. He alludes to the building of the ancient
temple, and compares it with the heavenly and spiritual temple; as if he had
said, "When you shall be led into captivity, you will deplore the ruin of the
temple, but I will cause you to build one far more excellent." Thus, "for brass
I will bring gold, for iron silver, for wood brass, for stones iron;" that is,
everything shall be full of magnificence and splendor in that temple which shall
come in place of the former.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We know that this
prediction was never accomplished ill that external restoration of the people,
or during the commencement of it, and even that the temple which was afterwards
erected was far inferior to the former. It follows, therefore, that the Prophet,
to whom a full redemption was exhibited in spirit, not only relates what shall
happen immediately after the return of the people, but discourses concerning the
excellence of the spiritual temple; that is, of the Church of Christ. We must,
therefore, come down in uninterrupted succession to Christ, if we wish to
understand this prophecy. In his reign these things were abundantly fulfilled,
and the glory of the former temple was greatly surpassed; for the Lord poured
out gifts of the Holy Spirit, which are more excellent than gold, silver, and
jewels. We may therefore see the temple now built with precious stones, as was
formerly said.

magistracy peace. </i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1005</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Instead of "magistracy" some render the word "tribute." I have no doubt that the
Prophet intended indirectly to compare the wretched bondage of the people under
which they were to be kept, with that pre-eminently high rank which they
afterwards obtained. With "peace" and "righteousness" he contrasts the
"magistrates" who exercised unjust rule, while they were harassed by the avarice
and cruelty of the
Babylonians.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thy exactors
righteousness. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He now shows that when their
"exactors" shall have been exterminated, there will be no "magistracy" but that
of "peace" and "righteousness." "They who shall have power over thee will
observe righteousness and peace." This was more fully accomplished when, through
Christ, we were delivered from the tyranny of the devil; for by the Gospel he
set up a kingdom of righteousness which he has not yet completed; but we must
look for his last coming so as to have our eyes eagerly fixed on it, and, in the
meantime, must; be satisfied with those
first-fruits.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Oppression shall no longer be
heard in thy land. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Here he states more clearly
what we have already said, namely, that, while the Prophet discourses concerning
the prosperous condition of the Church, he indirectly contrasts the miseries and
calamities by which they had been afflicted in various ways. He promises,
therefore, that they shall never afterwards be subjected to such afflictions.
Yet nevertheless various afflictions afterwards befell them. This is undoubtedly
true; but the people were never scattered in such a manner as not to have some
remaining form of the Church, and thus to enjoy peace, and to feel that they
were protected and kept by the hand of God. These words did not contain a
promise of exemption from every annoyance and distress; but by comparison they
held out this solace for future evils, that God spares his Church, and
consequently the Church shall be safe under his protection; and during the very
course of the deliverance there was exhibited a striking proof of this peace,
which the Prophet extols. Finally, we must always keep in remembrance what we
have so often said, that; it is only in part that all these things are
experienced by us; for the kingdom of Christ has not yet been
completed.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thy gates
Praise. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He alludes, as we have often said
already, to the building of the temple or the city, and shows that the Church
shall be safe, not by means of walls, or towers, or any enclosures, but that,
although there are no earthly defenses, there shall be abundance of safety and
peaceful joy in God alone. Now he connects the safety of the Church with "peace"
or "joy; " because she rejoices at being safe and sound, whereas formerly she
lay silently in affliction and despair.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b>and <b>20. </b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt
no longer have the sun for the light of days.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He teaches that the prosperity of the Church
shall not be temporary, but permanent; for he distinguishes it from the ordinary
condition of men, among whom there is nothing steadfast or permanent; because
there is nothing under the sun, however well regulated, that is not subject to
various changes. But we ought not to judge of the Church from the dangers of the
present life; for she is preserved in the midst of the billows; as if he had
said, "Do not judge of thy safety from the present appearance of things, but
know that it is laid up in God. God will be thy sun, so that thou hast no need
of borrowing light from the sun or the moon. Do not, therefore, dread any change
or revolution of affairs; for thou shalt have a perpetual and unchangeable
light."</font><br><font face="Palatino">By these words the Prophet does not mean
that the children of God shall be deprived of the ordinary advantages of life;
for, since the Lord. bestows them indiscriminately on all men, he certainly has
appointed them also for his children, for whose sake, indeed, God created all
things, since he exercises a peculiar care over them. But the Prophet intended
to express a still greater blessing, which the children of God alone enjoy,
namely, the heavenly Light, which ungodly men hate, and therefore cannot
receive; for, although they enjoy the sun and other blessings, yet their
happiness cannot be firm and enduring; because, being void of taste, they do not
relish that which was of the greatest importance, that they have God for their
Father.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Thus he distinguishes the condition of
the Church and of believers from the ordinary lot of men, that we may not judge
of it from the revolution and change of events, and next that we may know that,
amidst the thickest darkness, the fatherly kindness of God shines on believers,
in order to cheer them. And, indeed, although all the elements either cease to
discharge their duty, or threaten us with a melancholy aspect, yet it ought to
be enough that God is reconciled to us. By a figure of speech, in which a part
is taken for the whole, he includes, under the terms "Sun" and "Moon," the whole
condition of man, which is continually undergoing
change.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy people also are all
righteous.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he shows what is the true
establishment of the Church; namely, when she is purged of the ungodly, and none
but righteous men have a place in her. Yet we know that, in the Church,
hypocrites have always been mingled with the true children of God. We have said
that this is a description of the whole reign of Christ, not such as it shall be
at any one moment, but in its perfection. Christ began to do this at his coming,
when he purged the Church. Hence also he calls the Church "a sieve,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
3:12) because by means of it the chaff is separated from the wheat; but he goes
on from day to day in purifying it, and will go on till the day of harvest. Yet
there must be much rubbish mixed with the wheat, which shall at length be
removed on that day. Besides, there is an implied contrast between this people
and that irreligious and unholy multitude which, by its defilement, had polluted
the sanctuary of God. The use of the plural number appears to denote an
assemblage of nations, when he says that all the peoples shall be
righteous.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall inherit
the land for ever. </i></font><font face="Palatino">I have no doubt that, in
these words, the Prophet had his eye on Judea, and indirectly contrasted the
time of restoration with the time of the captivity which was immediately at
hand; as if he had said, "Though I drive out my people from their inheritance,
yet after seventy years I will restore them, that they may possess it for ever."
Besides, it ought to be observed that, when he limits to the "righteous" that
promise which related to the people of Zion, there is implied a sort of
correction, in order to exclude hypocrites, who falsely and unwarrantably are
wont to appropriate to themselves what is said about the true children of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This sentiment, therefore, agrees with
these words, "How good is God to Israel, to those who are of an upright heart!"
in which the Psalmist claims the name of "Israel," which all without exception
had in their mouth, as belonging to none but God's sincere worshippers.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;197301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
73:1) Such is the import, in this passage, of the phrase, "Thy people," that is,
the remaining portion which shall have been purged from its defilement. This was
not, in every respect, fulfilled in the Jews; but a beginning was made with
them, when they were restored to their native country, that, by their agency,
the possession of the whole earth might afterwards be given to them, that is, to
the children of God. For as he formerly spoke of the restoration of the temple,
which was not complete at Jerusalem, but must be extended throughout the whole
world, so the possession of this land must not be limited to Judea, since it is
more extensive, and all men are called to it, that by faith they may be children
of Abraham, and may thus become heirs of it.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480428&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
4:28)</font><br><font face="Palatino">We must therefore observe carefully those
modes of expression which are customary among the prophets, that we, nay
understand their meaning, and not break off sentences, or torture them to
meanings different from what was intended. Exceedingly unnatural and
inconsistent with the style of the prophets is the interpretation of those who
explain "the land" to mean heaven and the blessed life; for the land of Canaan
was given to the children of God with this intention, that, being separated from
the whole world, and having become God's heritage, they might worship him there
in a right manner; and consequently, to dwell in the land by right of
inheritance means nothing else than to remain in the family of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The branch of his

"branch," which shall come forth, shall be the work of his hands, this tends to

for it was impossible, to human view, that the Church should spring up again,
which all perceived to be dead, especially while the root was hidden. Thus, in
order that it may spring up, he says that God will be like a husbandman, who
plants anew that which had been torn up and was withered. In a word, he declares
that it will be a wonderful work of God, and not of men, that the Church shall
be rescued from a wretched and harsh captivity; for she shall be raised up as
from the dead. And indeed all that relates to the heavenly life was neither
produced in us by nature nor obtained by our own strength, but flows and
proceeds from God alone. What is here said universally concerning the whole body
every person ought to apply to himself in particular; for we are God's
"planting" before the world was made,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
1:4,) and were afterwards ingrafted into Christ, and called, that we might have
the testimony of our election and planting. Wicked men are not God's planting;
and therefore Christ declares that "they whom his heavenly Father hath not
planted shall be rooted up."

said, that, although they were few in number, yet the Church of God would be
populous. When the Prophet foretold these things, there was still a vast
multitude of people; but afterwards it was so greatly diminished that not more
than a feeble remnant was left, as we have formerly seen.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:9; 10:22) he declares that the small number shall be so much enlarged, that it
shall afterwards be a vast body of people, and shall possess great strength. Let
us consider that what was said to the Jews is now said also to us; that is,
though we are few in number and inconsiderable, and appear to be very near
destruction, still the Church cannot perish, but will be enlarged and multiplied
till it become very numerous; for it is God's planting, and therefore we must
not judge of it from the multitude or strength of
men.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I Jehovah.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He now shows the reason why he said all those
things which we have formerly seen; namely, that we may not suppose him to be
like men, whose labors and efforts quickly pass away. Although they wish to
change the condition of any kingdom or of the world, they will accomplish
nothing; but the Lord changes everything in an instant. He does not speak,
therefore, of an ordinary government, but of a wonderful work by which the Lord
delivers and multiplies his
Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Will hasten it in her
time. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He says that "he will hasten this," so as
to complete it. But he employs a little word which deserves notice as to the
time of the Church; for the relative is in the feminine gender, and is
improperly interpreted by some as relating to God.  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1007</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The Prophet means that there is a fixed time when the Church shall be delivered;
and in this way he exhorts believers to patience, that they may not plunge
headlong, but depend on God's eternal purpose, who knows how to arrange every
moment in an appropriate manner.</font><br><font face="Palatino">First, then, he
describes the seasonableness and the time when it is advantageous that. the
Church shall be delivered. We do not indeed perceive this, for we would wish to
obtain instantly God's promises, and are impatient of delay; but the Lord delays
for our benefit, and because the time is not yet come. Next, he speaks of haste;
for the Lord appears to us to be idle and inactive, when he prolongs the time;
although he hastens to accomplish everything at the proper season, which he
knows.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Spirit of the Lord
Jehovah. </i></font><font face="Palatino">As Christ explains this passage with
reference to himself,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;420418&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
4:18) so commentators limit it to him without hesitation, and lay down this
principle, that Christ is introduced as speaking, as if the whole passage
related to him alone. The Jews laugh at this, as an ill-advised application to
Christ of that which is equally applicable to other prophets. My opinion is,
that this chapter is added as a seal to the former, to confirm what had hitherto
been said about restoring the Church of Christ; and that for this purpose Christ
testifies that he has been anointed by God, in consequence of which he justly
applies this prophecy to himself; for he has exhibited clearly and openly what
others have laid down ill an obscure manner.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But
this is not inconsistent with the application of this statement to other
prophets, whom the Lord has anointed; for they did not speak in their own name
as individuals, or claim this authority for themselves, but were chiefly
employed in pointing out the office of Christ, to whom belongs not only the
publication of these things, but likewise the accomplishment of them. This
chapter ought, therefore, to be understood in such a sense, that Christ, who is
the Head of the prophets, holds the chief place, and alone makes all those
revelations; but that Isaiah, and the other prophets, and the apostles,
contribute their services to Christ, and each performs his part in making known
Christ's benefits. And thus we see that those things which Isaiah said would be
accomplished by Christ, have now been actually
accomplished.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On that account
Jehovah hath anointed me. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This second clause is
added in the room of exposition; for the first would have been somewhat obscure,
if he had said nothing as to the purpose for which he was endued with the Spirit
of God; but now it is made far more clear by pointing out the use, when he
declares that. he discharges a public office, that he may not be regarded as a
private individual. Whenever Scripture mentions the Spirit, and says that he
"dwelleth in us,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450811&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:11;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 3:16) let us not look upon it as something empty or unmeaning, but
let us contemplate his power and efficacy. Thus, after having spoken of the
Spirit of God, the Prophet next mentions the "anointing," by which he means the
faculties which flow from him, as Paul teaches that the gifts are indeed
various, but the Spirit is one.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 12:4)</font><br><font face="Palatino">This passage ought to be
carefully observed, for no man can claim right or authority to teach unless he
show that he has been prompted to it by the Spirit of God, as Paul also affirms
that "no man can call Jesus Lord, but by the Holy Ghost."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 12:3) But, it will be said, we see that almost all men boast of
having the Spirit of God; for the Pope, and the Anabaptists, and other heretics
and fanatics, have his name continually in their mouth, as if they were governed
by him. How, then, shall we judge that any man has been sent by God, and is
guided by his Spirit? By "anointing; " that is, if he is endued with the gifts
which are necessary for that orate. If therefore, having been appointed by the
Lord, he abound in the graces of the Spirit and the ability which the calling
demands, he actually has the Spirit. And if he wish to make profession of
enjoying that teacher, and if he have no doctrine,  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1008</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
let him be held as an
impostor.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He hath sent me to
preach. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The Prophet does not claim for himself
right and authority to teach, before he has shown that the Lord "hath sent him"
The authority is founded on his having been "anointed," that is, furnished by
God with necessary gifts. We ought not to hear him, therefore, as a private
individual, but as a public minister who has come from
heaven.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the afflicted.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Some render it, "To the meek; " and both ideas
are conveyed by the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ywn[</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>gnanavim</i>). But I preferred to adhere to the former signification,
because the Prophet is speaking of captives and prisoners. Yet I think that he
includes both; for he means those who, while they are altogether forsaken and
abandoned, are also wretched in themselves. Christ is promised to none but those
who have been humbled and overwhelmed by a conviction of their distresses, who
have no lofty pretensions, but keep themselves in humility and modesty. And
hence we infer that Isaiah speaks literally of the Gospel; for the Law was given
for the purpose of abasing proud hearts which swelled with vain confidence, but
the Gospel is intended for "the afflicted," that is, for those who know that
they are destitute of everything good, that they may gather courage and support.
For what purpose were prophets, and apostles, and other ministers, anointed and
sent, but to cheer and comfort the afflicted by the doctrine of
grace?</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To bind up the broken
in heart. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Numerous are the metaphors which the
Prophet employs for explaining more clearly the same thing. By "binding up," he
means nothing else than "healing," but now he expresses something more than in
the preceding clause; for he shows that. the preaching of the word is not an
empty sound, but a powerful medicine, the effect of which is felt, not by
obdurate and hard-hearted men, but by wounded
consciences.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To proclaim
liberty to the captives. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This also is the end
of the Gospel, that they who are captives may be set at liberty. We are
prisoners and captives, therefore, till we are set free

chains, let us not refuse the grace that is offered to us. It ought to be
observed in general, that the blessings which are here enumerated are bestowed
upon us by heavenly doctrine, and that none are fit for the enjoyment of them
but those who, conscious of their poverty, eagerly desire the assistance of
Christ, as he himself says,</font><br></div>

mentions the time of bestowing such distinguished grace, in order to remove the
doubts which might arise. We know by daily experience how numerous and
diversified are the anxious cares which distract the heart,. He affirms that he
is the herald of future grace, the time of which he fixes from the
"good-pleasure" of God; for, as he was to be the Redeemer of the Church by free
grace, so it was in his power, and justly, to select the
time.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Perhaps he alludes to the Jubilee,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;032510&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
25:10) but undoubtedly he affirms that we must wait calmly and gently till it
please God to stretch out his hand. Paul calls this year "the time of fullness."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians

time; behold, now is the day of salvation."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234908&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
49:8) Paul applies this to his own preaching; for, while the Lord addresses us
by the Gospel, the door of heaven is thrown open to us, that we may now, as it
were, enter into the possession of God's benefits.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2

of the time and the occasion when such distinguished blessings are offered to
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the day of vengeance
to our God. </i></font><font face="Palatino">But those expressions appear to be
inconsistent with each other, namely, "The day of good-pleasure," and "The day
of vengeance." Why did Isaiah join together things so opposite? Because God
cannot deliver his Church without showing that he is a just judge, and without
taking vengeance on the wicked. He therefore employs the term "good-pleasure,"
with reference to the elect, and the term "day of vengeance," with reference to
the wicked, who cease not to persecute the Church, and consequently must be
punished when the Church is delivered. In like manner Paul also says, that "It
is righteous with God to grant relief to the afflicted,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;530106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Thessalonians 1:6) and to reward the enemies of believers who unjustly afflict
them;" and the Jews could not expect a termination of their distresses till
their enemies had been destroyed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet we ought
to observe the cause of our deliverance; for to his mercy alone, and not to our
merits, or excellence, or industry, must it be ascribed, he appears, indeed, as
I briefly remarked a little before, to allude to the Jubilee; but above all
things we should attend to this, that our salvation lies entirely in the
gracious will of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To
comfort all that mourn. </i></font><font face="Palatino">We ought to keep in
remembrance what we formerly remarked, that the end of the Gospel is, that we
may be rescued from all evils, and that, having been restored to our former
freedom, and all tears having been wiped from our eyes, we may partake of
spiritual joy. And if we are not partakers of so great a benefit, it must be
ascribed to our unbelief and ingratitude, by which we refuse and drive away God,
who freely offers himself to us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To appoint to the mourners in
Zion. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He proceeds with the same subject; for he
means that the punishment which was to be inflicted on the people shall be such
as still to leave room for forgiveness. And, in order more fully to convince
them of it, he says that the Lord has charged him with this office, that he may
proclaim this deliverance; and not to himself only, but also to others, till the
chief messenger arrive, namely, Christ, who actually bestows and exhibits what
God at that time commanded to be made known for a future period. Yet he means
that the "mourning" shall not hinder God from giving ground of joy, when he
shall think proper; for "to appoint" has the same meaning as "to fix the time,"
that the tediousness of delay may not discourage
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That I may give to them
beauty for ashes. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By the word, <i>give </i>he
speaks with commendation of the efficacy of the prediction, that they may be
fully convinced of the event. The allusion is to the ancient customs of the
Jews, who, when any calamity pressed hard upon them, sprinkled ashes on their
heads, and wore sackcloth.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;170403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Esther
4:3) By these he denotes the filth and mourning which necessarily attend the
wretched condition of the people, and contrasts them with the joy and gladness
which they shall have when they are restored to liberty. I think that we ought
not to pass by the allusion contained in the words
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rap</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>peer</i>) and
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rpa</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>epher;</i>) for, by the mere transposition of letters, he intended to denote
very different things, and, by an elegant inversion, a change of
condition.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Trees of
righteousness. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By these words he points out the
restoration of the people; as if he had said, "Whereas they had formerly been
rooted out and resembled a dry stock, they shall be planted and settled." Thus
he reminds them that they ought to contemplate the divine power, so that, though
they are slain and dead, still they may confidently hope that they shall be
restored so as to take root and to receive strength and increase. From this
ought to be drawn a universal doctrine, namely, that there is no other way in
which we are restored to life than when we are planted by the Lord. We are
indeed called his "planting," because he elected us from the beginning.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
1:4) But there is also another kind of "planting" which follows the former,
namely, the Calling, by which we are ingrafted through faith into Christ's body.
The Lord does this by the agency and ministry of the Gospel; but it must be
wholly ascribed to him, for "it is he alone that giveth the increase."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460307&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 3:7) We must always bear in mind the emblematical meaning of the
first deliverance as illustrating the spiritual kingdom of
Christ,.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He gives the appellation of "trees of
righteousness" to those in whom the justice of God or good order shines forth.
Yet let us know that the Lord adopts us on this condition, that we shall become
new creatures, and that true righteousness shall reign in us. And hence it
follows that we are by nature depraved and corrupted, and cannot yield fruit in
any other way than by being changed and planted by the Lord. This sets aside the
vain and haughty opinion of the Papists, who, by contriving either preparations
or the aids of free will, claim what belongs to God alone; for if we are planted
by the Lord, it follows that we are by nature dry and
unfruitful.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To glorify him.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">This is the design of our "planting; " but we
have already spoken of these things in expounding the twenty-first verse of the
preceding chapter.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall build the
deserts of the age. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He goes on to describe more
largely that restoration of the Church; and chiefly with this view, that the
Jews may entertain confident hope of deliverance, because those promises
appeared to be altogether incredible. And this is the reason why he adorns with
extensive and magnificent terms that benefit of redemption. It is a mistake to
suppose that these words, "the age" and "many ages, relate to a future period;
as if he had said that the building of which he speaks shall be firm and
permanent. The Prophet's meaning was widely different; for he shows (as I have
explained at another passage) that the long-continued ruins of the city shall
not prevent it from rising anew. When the inhabitants of any city, scattered in
all directions, have been absent for a very long time, there can be no hope of
rebuilding it; just as no person in the present day takes any concern about
rebuilding Athens. Thus, when the Jews had been banished into a distant country,
and Jerusalem had been forsaken for seventy years, who would have hoped that it
would be built by the citizens themselves?</font><br><font face="Palatino">For
this reason Isaiah employs the designations of "deserts of the age, ancient
wildernesses, cities of desolation, wildernesses of many ages," in order to show
that all this cannot prevent the Lord from restoring the city to be inhabited by
his elect at the proper time. Yet these statements ought also to be accommodated
to our time, so that, although the Lord permits his Church, when it has fallen
down, to lie long in ruins, and though there is no remaining hope of rebuilding
it, yet we may strengthen our heart by these promises; for it is God's peculiar
office to raise up and renew what had formerly been destroyed, and devoted as it
were to eternal rottenness. But we have formerly treated of these matters at the
fifty-eighth chapter.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.

</i></font><font face="Palatino">He means that foreigners and strangers shall be
ready to yield obedience to them; for, in consequence of their being at that
time separated from the rest of the nations, none was willing to assist them,
and therefore he says that "strangers stand; " that is, are ready to meet and
assist them. As to what follows, about "feeding sheep" and "cultivating fields
and vines," these are metaphorical expressions; for the Prophet treats of the
kingdom of Christ, which is spiritual, but by means of these figures describes
its perfect happiness, that we may understand it better from examples drawn from
those things which are known to us. Let us therefore understand that we shall be
truly happy when Christ shall exercise his dominion over us; for in this way
shall we likewise obtain, beyond expectation, many advantages of which the
children of Adam are justly deprived.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But ye shall be called the
priests of Jehovah. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This verse sheds somewhat
more light on the preceding; for in the second part of it the Prophet foretells
that believers shall enjoy the riches of the Gentiles, and shall be raised to
glory as their successors. The Jews, indeed, seize eagerly on such declarations,
and already devour by covetousness the wealth of all the nations, as if they
would one day possess it, and vaunt as if the glory of the whole world would
become their own.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But there are chiefly two
things that ought to be observed in these words, that we may more fully
understand them. First, the prophets, when they wish to describe the glory and
happiness of the Kingdom of Christ, borrow comparisons from human affairs.
Secondly, when they speak of the Church, they connect the Head with the members
in such a manner that sometimes they look more at the Head than at the members.
We must not understand the enjoyment of the wealth of others to mean that they
who are converted to Christ shall seize on the wealth, or glory, or rank of
others, which is most inconsistent with true religion; but because all things
shall be brought under the dominion of Christ, so that he alone shall hold
authority and rule. And that is what I have already said, that he looks both at
the members and the Head. But when they come into the power of Christ, they are
called ours, because Christ possesses nothing separate from his
Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the same manner it is said elsewhere,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234514&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
45:14) that the enemies of Christ "shall kiss his feet and supplicate pardon,"
although this is done in the Church, in which they acknowledge Christ and yield
to his doctrine. Thus Isaiah shows what the Father will give to the Son, who has
lawful authority over the whole world,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402818&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
28:18) and to whom</font><br></div>

2:8)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet we must not omit what I mentioned a little
before, that God gives large and kind support to his elect in the world, in
order that they may feel that their condition is far better than that of
unbelievers; for, though they are in want of many things, yet, being content
with a little, they cheerfully give thanks to God, so that their hunger is
better than all the abundance of
unbelievers.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Priests of
Jehovah. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By this term he shows that the
condition of the people shall be far more excellent than formerly; as if he had
said, "Hitherto the Lord had chosen you to be his heritage; but he will adorn
you with gifts much more excellent, for he will elevate you to the honor of the
priesthood." Although the whole people was "a kingdom of priests,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021906&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
19:6;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;053310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
33:10) yet we know that the tribe of Levi only discharged this office; but the
Prophet declares that in future it shall be common to all. This was not
manifested but under the reign of Christ. The restoration of the Church, indeed,
began at the time when the people returned from Babylon; but at the coming of
Christ believers were at length adorned and honored by this dignity; for all the
saints have been consecrated to Christ, and discharge that office. To this
belong the words of Peter,</font><br></div>

to be carefully observed; for we must no longer offer to God earthly sacrifices,

the Papists, who abuse this passage to prove their priesthood; for the Pope and
his lackeys ordain priests to sacrifice Christ, not to teach the people. But
Christ offered himself "by eternal redemption,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580912&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
9:12) and he alone has once exercised this priesthood, and commands that the
priest of the sacrifice shall be offered to us by the doctrine of the Gospel.
Those persons, therefore, who usurp this office, and wish to repeat what he has
completed, are guilty of sacrilege.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But every
person ought to offer himself,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
12:1) and all that he has, in sacrifice to God, that he may exercise this lawful
priesthood; and next, ministers, who have been specially called to this office
of teaching, ought to make use of the sword of the word to slay men and
consecrate them to God. Lastly, those are lawful ministers who do not of
themselves attempt or undertake anything, but faithfully and diligently execute
the commands which they have received from
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Instead of your
shame.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He confirms the former statement, in
which he said that believers who, clothed with sackcloth and covered with ashes,
mourned, shall be sprinkled with the oil of gladness. This change of mourning
into joy is again
promised.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall be a
double reward.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some interpret the word double
as meaning that they who have been redeemed by God shall be happy both before
God and before men. But I do not know that there are solid grounds for that
interpretation. I choose rather to adopt a more simple view; as if the Prophet
had said, "The prosperity of the Church shall be so great as togo far beyond all
the calamities and afflictions by which she is now oppressed." If, therefore,
she is now weary of her condition, she ought to look to that day when she shall
be most happy, as Paul contrasts "an eternal weight of glory" with "the
momentary lightness of afflictions."

Corinthians 4:17)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And instead
of disgrace they shall rejoice in their
portion.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Wicked men vaunt over us and indulge
in wantonness, because they think that they have the superiority; but the Lord
promises that ere long he will cause good men, rescued from their tyranny, to
obtain their portion. This began to be done, indeed, when the people returned
from captivity; but a clearer proof has been exhibited in Christ, and is
exhibited every day, and will at length be completed at his last coming, when
all things shall be fully renewed, and the wicked shall be thrown down, that we
may obtain the inheritance of the world. This is the reason why he says, by way
of acknowledgment, that the earth is the portion of those wicked men; for they
now boast that they are the lords of the world, but they shall at length feel
that it belongs peculiarly and specially to the children of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall have
everlasting joy.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This may relate to the outward
condition of the Church; ibr he daily supplies his people with ground of
thanksgiving; but as they must also devour many griefs, and are surrounded by
manifold sorrow, this prediction is not fulfilled but when joy of spirit reigns
and holds the pre-eminence in our hearts, accompanied by that "peace which (as
Paul says) surpasses all understanding,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;500407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
4:7,) which the children of God alone enjoy when they have the testimony of
adoption, He calls it everlasting, in order to shew how greatly it differs from
the joy of wicked men, which is momentary and quickly passes away, and is even
changed into "gnashing of teeth."

8:12.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I Jehovah love
judgment.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He not only confirms what he promised
in the name of the Lord, but likewise exhorts the Jews to repent, and shews
whence they ought to expect salvation, and what and how great is the Judge with
whom we have to do; for lie reasons from the nature of God in what manner they
ought to regulate their life, that they may not by their wickedness reject the
grace that is offered to them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Under the word<i>
judgment</i> he includes all that is just and equitable; for he contrasts this
word with the useless inventions of the Jews, by which they thought that they
satisfied God, and at the same time concealed their malice. The Lord cares not,
as we have often seen, for such masks and vain pretences, but demands true
cleanness of heart and hands pure from all unrighteousness. He who wishes to
obtain the approbation of God for himself and for all that he does must have an
upright heart and an unblemished
life.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And hate robbery in the
burnt-offering.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By a single part he
figuratively denotes all hypocritical worship of God; and under "burnt-offering"
is included every kind of sacrifice. Nothing is more abominable than when men,
from cheating and robbery, sacrifice to God, or when they mingle their lies,
hypocrisy, and impurity of heart, with their sacrifices, or corrupt the worship
of God by basely defrauding him. This vice abounds not only in a single age, but
at all times; for all men pretend to worship God, and even the wicked are
ashamed of not having an appearance of religion, the impression of a Divine
Ruler being so deeply engraven on the hearts of all that it cannot be erased.
Yet the greater park of men sport with God, and endeavor to satisfy him by
childish trifles.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Isaiah therefore condemns and
abhors this hypocrisy, and teaches that the Lord demands from us "mercy rather
than sacrifice."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;280606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
6:6;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400913&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
9:13; 12:7.) We cannot worship God in a right manner, if we do not observe the
Second Table, and abstain from all dishonesty and violence; for he who defrauds
or injures his neighbors does violence also to God. In a word, the design of the
Prophet is to teach what is the true character of repentance; namely, when,
laying aside hypocrisy, and dismissing all inventions, the worshippers of God
cherish natural kindness to one
another.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will establish
their work in truth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some explain it to mean
the "reward." of work. But I rather think that it denotes all the undertakings
of life, to which the Lord promises a prosperous issue. The undertakings of men
succeed very ill; because they do not choose to ask counsel of God, or attempt
anything under his guidance. Thus they are justly punished for their rashness;
because they trust in their own counsels, or depend on a blind stroke of
fortune, in which there is no reality whatever, but only a deceitful shadow. But
that they who are guided by the Spirit of God, and who commit themselves wholly
to his protection, should succeed prosperously and to their wish, is not at all
wonderful; for all prosperity flows from his blessing
alone.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By the word <i>truth</i> is meant a
uniform course; for even unbelievers are often puffed up with transitory joy,
but it speedily vanishes
away.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And will make an
everlasting covenant with them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In the
conclusion of the verse he assigns the cause of the stability. It is because God
is pleased not once only to stretch out his hand to them, but to be the
continual guide of the journey. And the true support of our perseverance is,
that he deigns to enter into an everlasting covenant with us, in which he
voluntarily makes himself our debtor, and freely bestows upon us all things,
though he owes us nothing whatever.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And their seed shall be known
among the Gentiles.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here the Prophet treats
more clearly of the extension of the Church, which at that time might be said to
be confined within a narrow corner of the earth, and afterwards, as we have
already seen, was exceedingly diminished and impaired.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:9; 10:22.) Isaiah therefore discourses concerning the Church, which, after
having suffered so great a diminution, would be spread throughout the whole
world, so as to be visible to all the nations. And yet this did not happen even
in the reign of Solomon, when the Jews flourished most in wealth and splendor.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;111021&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 10:21, 27.) Now this appeared to be altogether incredible; and that is the
reason why the prophets take such pains to convince men of it, and repeat it
very frequently, that the Jews may not measure this restoration by their own
understanding or by the present appearance of
things.</font><br><font face="Palatino">A question now arises, When did these
things happen? I reply (as I have often done before) that they began when the
people returned to their native country; for at that time, and in uninterrupted
succession, they experienced the manifold kindness of God towards them. But as
nothing more than feeble sparks appeared, the full brightness shone forth in
Christ, in whose reign those things are entirely accomplished; for where there
was the utmost barrenness of godliness, the offspring of Abraham sprouted,
because foreigners were ingrafted by faith into the elect people. Thus foreign
and barbarous nations acknowledged that the Jews were the blessed seed of God,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
22:18,) when they united with them in the same confession of faith; nor was this
fulfilled but once only, but is in course of being fulfilled every
day.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As to the Jews going before, and holding
the first rank in God's covenant, this ought to be ascribed to the mercy of God,
and not to their own excellence, as Paul
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:2) teaches; for, after having shown that by nature they differ nothing at all
from the Gentiles, and after having subjected them to the same condemnation, he
likewise teaches that they hold this privilege of pre-eminence, because they
were the very first that received the word of God and the promises. But this
proceeded from God's undeserved kindness, and not from their merits or
excellence.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rejoicing I shall rejoice in
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He represents the Church as giving
thanks to God, in order to convince them more fully of the truth of what he
formerly said. It may be regarded as
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">uJpotu&gt;twsiv</font><font face="Palatino">)
a lively description, by which the thing is, as it were, painted and laid before
the eyes of men, so as to remove all doubt; for by nature we are prone to
distrust, and so fickle, that we place confidence rather in the inventions of
men than in the word of God. As to this form of confirmation, we have spoken at
chapter 12:1; 26:1, and at other
passages.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For he hath clothed
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> These things were still, indeed, at a great
distance, but must have been seen and understood by the eyes of faith; as the
eyes should undoubtedly be raised to heaven, when the Prophet discourses
concerning salvation and righteousness. Nothing is visible here, and much less
could so great happiness have been perceived by the senses, while everything
tended to destruction. But because even now we do not see any such beauty of the
Church, which is even contemptible in the eyes of the world under the revolting
dress of the cross, we need faith, which comprehends heavenly and invisible
things.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With the garments of
salvation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He connects "righteousness" with
"salvation," because the one cannot be separated from the other. "Garments" and
"mantles" are well-known metaphors. It is as if he had said, that righteousness
and salvation had been bestowed upon them. Since the Lord bestows these
benefits, it follows that from him alone we should seek and expect
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He hath adorned
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The metaphor is supposed to be drawn from
priestly ornament; and accordingly there are some who speculate here about the
priesthood of Christ. But I do not think that the Prophet spoke so ingeniously;
for he brings forward the comparison of the bridegroom and the bride 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1011</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Formerly the Church lay in filth and rags, and was universally despised, as a
forsaken woman; but now, having been received into favor with her husband, she
shines with amazing lustre. A parallel passage occurs in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;280220&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
2:20. This was accomplished at the coming of Christ; but it is also bestowed
upon us daily, when the Lord adorns his people with righteousness and salvation.
But all these things, as we have often said already, shall be accomplished at
Christ's last coming.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For as the earth putteth
forth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By a beautiful comparison the Prophet
confirms the former promises; for he reminds the Jews of the ordinary power of
God, which shines brightly in the creatures themselves. The earth every year
puts forth her bud, the gardens grow green after the sowing time, and, in short,
herbs and plants, which appear to be dead during the winter, revive in the
spring and resume their vigor. Now these are proofs and very clear illustrations
of the divine power and kindness toward us; and since it is so, ought men to
doubt of it? Will not he who gave this power and strength to the earth display
it still more in delivering his people? And will he not cause to bud the elect
seed, of which he promised that it should remain in the world for
ever?</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Before all the
nations.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He again shews that the boundaries of
the Church shall no longer be as narrow as they formerly were, for the Lord will
cause her to fill the whole
world.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Will cause
righteousness and praise to spring forth,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He
mentions "righteousness," which was fully displayed when the Lord redeemed his
people; but the righteousness of God was chiefly seen, when Christ was
manifested to the world; not that God kept his righteousness concealed till that
time, but that men did not know it. It is, as if he had said, "God will deliver
and restore his people in such a manner that all shall acknowledge him to be
righteous." For redemption is a striking proof of the justice of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He next mentions praise; because such a
benefit ought to be accompanied by thanksgiving. The end of "righteousness" is,
that glory may be given to God; and therefore he exhorts us to gratitude; for it
is exceedingly base to be dumb after having received God's
benefits.</font><br></div>

which was almost to blot out the name of the whole nation, it was necessary to
confirm and encourage believers by many words, that with strong and assured
confidence they might rely on these promises under the burden of the cross.
Here, therefore, the Prophet, discharging that office which had been entrusted
to him, openly declares that he will not be slack in the performance of his
duty, and will not cease to speak, till he encourage the hearts of believers by
the hope of future salvation, that they may know and be fully convinced that God
will be the deliverer of his Church. He too might have been dismayed by the
unbelief of that people, and might have lost courage when he saw that matters
were every day growing worse, and when he foresaw that terrible vengeance. But,
notwithstanding so great difficulties, he will still persist in his duty, that
all may know that neither the massacre of the people nor their unbelief can
prevent God from executing his promises at the proper
time.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And on account of
Jerusalem I will not rest.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It was necessary
that these things should be frequently repeated, because such is the depravity
of our mind that we speedily forget God's promises. When he says that he will
not cease to speak, he likewise reminds others of their duty, that they may take
courage, and expect with assured confidence their restoration, though it be long
delayed, and even that their unwearied attention may answer to the voice of God
which constantly addresses them. We know by experience every day how necessary
this is, while Satan endeavors by every method to turn us aside from the right
course.</font><br><font face="Palatino">At the same time he shews what ought to
be the aim of godly teachers, namely, to spend and devote themselves entirely
for the advantage of the Church; for when he says "on account of Zion," he means
that our chief care ought to be that the Church may be preserved, and that none
are good and faithful teachers but they who hold the salvation of the Church so
dear as to spare no labors. Some explain this as relating to prayer, but I
choose rather to refer it to doctrine; and it is more natural to view it as
meaning' that no inconvenience or annoyance shall wear out his patience, and no
opposition shall retard him from proceeding in the office of teaching which God
has enjoined on him concerning the redemption of the Church. For if he had
survived that very sad calamity, the unbelieving multitude would undoubtedly
have persecuted him, as well as the other Prophets, by many reproaches; but
whatever may happen, he says that he is fortified by unshaken firmness, never to
be dumb through shame, but to proceed with unremitting eagerness in his course.
Besides, by this form of expression he procures credit to his predictions, and
maintains their authority, so that, even when he is dead, they do not cease to
resound in the ears of
believers.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Till her
righteousness go forth as brightness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By
"righteousness" he means the rights of the Church; for during the period of
calamity, she appeared to be condemned. Her "righteousness," therefore, "goes
forth" when she is perfectly restored, and regains her former condition; for
that righteousness lay concealed during the
captivity.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And her
salvation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To "righteousness" he adds
"salvation," because they whom God justifies, or to whom he re-restores their
rights, do likewise regain their "salvation." Hence we infer that we are
wretched and without assistance, so long as God withholds his grace from us on
account of our sins; and therefore in other passages he frequently gave the
appellation of "the righteousness of God" to that which he here affirms to be
the righteousness of the Church. Thus we are undone while we are destitute of
the righteousness of God; that is, while we slumber in our sins, and God shews
himself to be a severe judge by punishing us for
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The phrase "go forth" means that the
righteousness of the Church was hidden and, as it were, buried for a time: she
deserved in the sight of God no favor; but, on the contrary, her unspeakable
iniquities prevailed to such an extent that there remained nothing but God's
righteous vengeance. But here the Prophet has his eye on men who already looked
upon the afflicted Church as lost, and by their pride and reproaches almost cast
her down to hell.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>May burn
like a lamp.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Finally, he compares her to the
world, and says, that with respect to the world she shall be righteous, when God
shall have purged away her sins and undertaken her cause. By these words the
Prophet teaches that we ought always to entertain favorable hopes of the
restoration of the Church, though she be plunged under thick darkness and in the
grave; for although for a time she is overwhelmed and hidden, yet she has God
for her avenger in heaven, who, after having chastised her moderately, will at
length shew that she was the object of his care. And indeed his righteousness
must be illustrious and manifest, and that for the salvation of those whom he
hath chosen to be his people and heritage.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Gentiles shall
see.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now states more plainly the reason why
he formerly said that he would not be silent, namely, that believers may be
fully convinced that salvation is not promised to them in
vain.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And all the kings of the
earth thy glory.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he employs the word
"glory" as meaning "salvation." We see here the argument by which prophets must
fortify themselves for perseverance, namely, that the Lord is faithful, and will
at length fulfill what he has once promised, though he delay for a time. The
word kings serves for amplification; as if he had said that not only mean
persons and those of the lowest rank shall behold and admire the glory of God,
but even "kings" themselves, who commonly look down with contempt on all that
was worthy in other respects of being esteemed and honored; for they are blinded
by their splendor, and maddened by their high rank, so that they do not
willingly behold any rank but their
own.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt be called
by a new name.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By a "new name" he means "a
crowded assemblage;" for the people were so completely scattered, that there was
no visible body, and they appeared to be altogether ruined. Although a vast
multitude of persons were led into captivity, yet, having been scattered among
the Babylonians, they were driven about like the members of a body broken in
pieces, and scarcely retained the name of a people; which had also been foretold
to them. After having been brought back from captivity, they began again to be
united in one body, and thus regained the "name" of which they had been
deprived. Yet "new" denotes what is uncommon; as if the Prophet had said that
the glory of the people shall be extraordinary and such as was never before
heard of. We know that this took place in the progress of time; for that small
band of people, while they dwelt by sufferance in their native country, could
not by any extraordinary distinction arrive at so great renown; but at length,
when the doctrine of the Gospel had been preached, the Jewish name became known
and renowned.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which the mouth
of Jehovah shall name.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He confirms what would
otherwise have been hard to be believed, by promising that God will be the
author of this glory; for it was not in the power of men thus to raise a Church
which had sunk low and was covered with dishonor, but to God, who "lifteth up
the poor from the dunghill,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B307&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
113:7,) it was not difficult to adorn his Church by new celebrity. As there was
no face of a Church for forty years, and, although the Lord had some seed, yet
it was in a state so disordered and so ruinous that there was no visible people
of God, he now restores to the Church its name, when he has assembled it by the
word of the Gospel. This majestic work of God, therefore, ought to confirm us on
this point, that we may know that he will never forsake his Church; and although
wicked men tear us by their slanders, and beat and spit upon us, and in every
way endeavor to make us universally loathed, let us remember that God is not
deprived of his right to vindicate us in the world, whose names he has deigned
to write in heaven.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Others expound the passage
in a more ingenious manner, namely, that instead of Israelites they shall be
called Christians. But I think that the former meaning is more agreeable to the
context and to the Prophet's ordinary language; and we ought carefully to
observe those forms of expression which are peculiar to the prophets, that we
may become familiar with their style. In a word, the people shall be restored,
though it appears to be exterminated, and shall obtain, not from men but from
God, a new name.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thou shalt be a crown of
glory.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Isaiah proceeds with the same subject,
and we need not wonder at this; for no man, by judging from the flesh, could
have formed such vast conceptions and expectations. Besides, he intended to fix
the hearts of believers on the kingdom of Christ, which it was the more
necessary to adorn and magnify by these illustrious titles, because hitherto it
was not only obscure but at a great distance. It was needful to provide against
a twofold danger, that the Jews, when they saw that they were still at a very
great distance from their former honor, might not, on the one hand, despise the
grace of God, or, on the other hand, rest satisfied with the mere beginnings,
and thus, by disregarding Christ, devote their whole attention to earthly
advantages. The Prophet therefore reminds them, that the return to their native
country was but the forerunner of that exalted rank which was to be expected at
the manifestation of Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino">So far as relates
to the former clause, exiles and slaves could perceive nothing but ground for
despair, when they beheld the outward condition of things, since, after having
returned and been restored to their country, they made very little progress in
building the temple. Accordingly, he bids them look to God, that they may expect
from him the glory which is concealed from the eyes of flesh, and, knowing that
they are dear and precious in his sight, may be fully satisfied with this, till
he adorn them more bountifully by the hand of
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the diadem of the
kingdom.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He calls the Church God's crown,
because God wishes that his glory should shine in us; and in this it is proper
that we should behold and admire the inconceivable goodness of God, since,
notwithstanding that we are by nature filthy and corrupted, and more abominable
than the mire of the streets, yet he adorns us in such a manner that he wishes
us to be "the diadem of his kingdom." Let us therefore be aroused by this
goodness of God to the desire of leading a holy life, that his image may more
and more be formed anew in us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt no more be called
forsaken.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He meets a difficulty which might
occur to the minds of believers, seeing that they were forsaken and abandoned,
while at the same time they were called a "diadem" and a "crown." Seeing that
they were hated and abhorred by all nations, and sometimes even lay prostrate at
the feet of their enemies, and no assistance of any kind was seen, it might
appear ridiculous that they should receive these names, and thus be elevated to
heaven and placed in the hand of God. He therefore means that the people, though
for a time they resemble a divorced and forsaken woman, shall yet be restored so
as to change their condition and name; as if he had said, "This divorce shall
not be perpetual; God will at length receive thee to himself." Thus, although
the Church seems to be "forsaken," and has the appearance of a divorced woman,
yet the Lord will put an end to her afflictions and
miseries.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For they shall call
thee,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My good-pleasure in
her</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He teaches that this proceeds from the
"good-pleasure of God;" that is, from his undeserved favor, that nothing may be
ascribed to the merits or excellence of men; as he says in
Hosea,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"I will espouse thee to
me in mercy and
compassions."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;280219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Hosea
2:19.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And thus he shews that they shall be prosperous for
no other reason than because God, out of his infinite goodness, will graciously
condescend to receive into favor those whom he had abandoned. Although this
relates strictly to the Church, yet let us learn in general that it is by the
favor and bounty of God that cities and kingdoms are restored to their former
condition, which, while he was angry and offended, appeared to be ruined. The
Prophet, therefore, holds out to the consideration of the Jews the source of all
the calamities which they had suffered, when he testifies that when God is
reconciled to them, they will be happy; for we may gather from it that formerly
God was angry with them, when their condition was wretched and
miserable.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thy land shall
be married.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This metaphor, by which he denotes
the restoration of the people, is highly beautiful, and conveys twofold
instruction. He shews that the state of variance between God and the Church
shall be terminated; first, because she shall be received as a wife by her
appeased husband; and secondly, because the multitude of people will take away
the reproach of widowhood. The earth is, in some sense, married to its
inhabitants, as trees to vines; and, on the other hand, when it is stripped of
its inhabitants, it is said to be a
widow.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the good-pleasure
of Jehovah is in thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He again repeats and
confirms what has been already said, that it is owing to the undeserved kindness
of God that the Church is restored, that she remains in her condition, that the
earth receives its inhabitants; for when God turns away his face and is angry
with us, nothing can be looked for but destruction, and nothing can be expected
from the aid or strength of men.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For as a young man marrieth a
virgin.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This verse contains nothing more than
an explanation and confirmation of the preceding verse. Now there appears to be
a sort of contradiction in this respect, that in the latter clause he makes God
the only Husband of the Church, while in the former clause he assigns to her
many husbands. But the solution is easy; for, when this marriage of the Church
is spoken of, there is but one Husband, that is, God, who always claims for
himself that title; and that is fulfilled in Christ, to whom, as Paul says, the
pastors "espouse the Church as a chaste virgin."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;471102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 11:2.) Yet this does not prevent the metaphor of marriage from being
employed to describe that unity of faith which all the children of God have with
their mother, the Church. Nay more, it is consistent with God being the Husband
of his Church, that he marries to his Church all the nations that are assembled
to her; for, when she is without children, she may be said to be widowed and
solitary. This is said, therefore, even with respect to God, who, by ratifying
with his guidance the sacred amity between the members of his Church, extends
the effect of marriage to the whole body.</font><br><font face="Palatino">And
hence it ought to be inferred, that the Church of God shall be truly populous,
that is, shall have many children, when she is united to God her Husband; for we
must begin with God, that he may preside over his Church, and that under his
guidance we may be gathered into her bosom; for then shall the marriage be truly
sacred. But for this a vast multitude of people will not constitute a church,
but rather an abominable brothel; as we see that in Popery there is boasting of
the name of God, and yet the majesty of God is dishonored in it by frightful
sacrilege.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On thy
walls.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As the Prophet intended to describe the
perfect happiness of the kingdom of Christ, so he makes an assemblage of all
that belongs to the prosperous condition of any country or city. To other
advantages he adds guards and a garrison; because the greatest abundance of all
good things would be of little avail, if we were not safe from enemies; and
therefore he declares that the Lord will not only supply the Church with all
that is necessary, but will also appoint faithful guards to ward off enemies and
robbers, that he may thus be recognised, both within and without, as the author
of a happy life.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who shall not
be, silent.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By "being silent," he means "being
at rest;" as if he had said, "They will be continually on the watch, so as to
foresee at a great distance the dangers that threaten
them."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye who are mindful of
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He next explains who these guards are,
namely, those who "shall be mindful of the Lord," that is, shall celebrate the
memory of his name. Although among the guards we might, without impropriety,
reckon the angels,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;199111&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
91:11;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580114&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
1:14,) to whom we know that this office is assigned, yet because they willingly
and cheerfully watch over the safety of the Church, and do not need to be
spurred on by exhortations, the Prophet addresses his discourse to other
watchmen.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The word which he employs is of
doubtful meaning. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1012</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Sometimes it signifies "to remember," and sometimes "to bring to remembrance;"
and neither of those significations will be inappropriate. But I think that he
simply means that these guards will be God's ministers to celebrate his name.
Some render it "Making known the Lord;" but that is unnatural, and suddenly
breaks off the Prophet's meaning; and such commentators do not attend to the
comparison of the guards of a city, which the Prophet
employs.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Although the Prophet intends simply to
teach that the Church will be safe from all dangers, because she has God to
watch over her safety, yet we ought always to consider what is the nature of
Christ's kingdom; for it is not defended by the weapons of war or by arms, but,
being spiritual, is protected by spiritual arms and guards. The Lord will
therefore have his ministers, whose agency he will employ for defending the
Church by the sword of the word, that she may be kept safe; not by earthly
guards, but by God's secret and spiritual power; and the Prophet explains
himself by saying, "Ye who are mindful of the Lord." Although this statement
relates to all the godly, who are commanded to celebrate the name of God in all
places, as far as lies in their power, yet it is chiefly addressed to the
priests, who, discharging a public office, should hold out an example to others,
and devote themselves with all their heart to the praises of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>During the whole day and
the whole night.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here pastors are reminded of
their duty; for it is not enough to feed the Lord's flock, if they do not
likewise defend it from the attacks of robbers and wolves. "Night and day,"
therefore, they must guard and keep watch, if they wish to perform their duty in
a proper manner.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Keep not
silence.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Lord forbids them to be silent;
for he wishes them to be diligent and attentive; and in this he shews how great
is the care which he takes about the safety of the Church. This passage
testifies that it is a remarkable kindness of God, when we have faithful pastors
who take care of us; for we are exposed to dangers of every kind, and lie open
to the snares of Satan, if the Lord do not protect us by his guards; and
therefore we ought always to pray that he would surround us with those guards
which he sees that we need.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And do not give him
silence.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Hitherto the Prophet has spoken of the
office and duty of teaching; but as this would not be enough if prayer were not
likewise added, he exhorts the ministers of the word to prayer; for I think that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wl</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>lo</i>,) "to him," refers to God. We ought, therefore, to plead with God,
and to entreat by earnest prayer, that he will give some success to our labors,
which would otherwise be unprofitable. And since we devote ourselves entirely to
preaching doctrine, and vigorously oppose all the machinations of Satan, let us
learn, at the same time, to turn our minds to God, that he may not permit our
labors to be unsuccessful. In the same manner as he applied the word "silence"
to doctrine in the beginning of the chapter, when he said, "I will not be
silent," so in this passage he applies it to prayer, by which we obtain from God
some fruit of doctrine. Even the angels move us by their example to this
earnestness of prayer, as we read in Zechariah that the angel prays ardently for
the restoration of the Church.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;380112&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
1:12.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Till he
restore.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Hence infer that there are two
distinct benefits: first, to have faithful pastors who shall watch over the
safety of the Church; secondly, that the Church be upheld and preserved in her
condition by their agency. But God, who speaks here, claims these benefits as
his own; which he also does in many other passages. "How shall they preach,"
says Paul, "unless they be sent?"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451015&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:15.) It belongs to God alone, therefore, to appoint pastors; for no man could
otherwise have been "sufficient"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 2:16) for an office so important and so difficult; and it is he
alone who promotes by their agency the restoration of the Church; for their
efforts would be altogether vain and fruitless, if the Lord did not grant them
prosperous success. And here we see that the external agency of men is joined
with the efficacy of the Holy Spirit; for, although the Lord alone is the author
and finisher of the work, yet he brings forward instruments which he employs for
rearing the building of the Church. This reminds us that we ought not to lose
courage, even when we see nothing but ruin and wretchedness and desolation; but
it is our duty to pray that the Lord will restore her, which he also promises
that he will do.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And till he
place Jerusalem a praise.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This means to render
the Church glorious, that ground of joy may shine forth from it; for when we
feel nothing but God's severity, we become dumb, and are overwhelmed with shame;
but when he frees us from our afflictions, and causes us to recover, he at the
same time opens our mouth; for he supplies us with ground of praise and
thanksgiving.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jehovah hath
sworn.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He proceeds with the metaphors which he
formerly used; for since, owing to the corruption of our nature, the kingdom of
Christ cannot be described so as to be level to our capacity; it was necessary
to represent it under figures. In the same manner as he promised, first, an
abundance of all things, and next, faithful guardianship, that the condition of
believers may be safe; so here he promises tranquillity and repose, that they
may peacefully enjoy their blessings, and may not in future be defrauded of
them. As if he had said, "Whatever thou hadst formerly in thy hands was exposed
to plunder and robbery; but now thou shalt have everything well secured, and
shall freely partake of thy corn and thy wine; and, in a word, thou shalt enjoy
thy prosperity in peace."</font><br><font face="Palatino">But since the
depravity of our nature is such that we do not place trust in God, though he
promise largely and bountifully, for this reason the Prophet represents him as
swearing; for the Lord condescends to us so far as to make use of an oath, in
order to correct still more our unbelief and obstinacy. Now, the Lord "sweareth
by himself, because" (as an Apostle says) "he hath none greater than himself."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580613&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
6:13.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By his right hand and
by the arm of his strength.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He mentions his
"right arm," that is, the power of God; because that was appropriate to the
present discourse. As if he had said, "If I have any power, I will display it in
your salvation; and lest, in an arduous affair, your minds should slumber, I
swear by my hand, which is invincible and victorious over all, that, whatever
difficulties may arise, you shall be safe under my protection." Whenever
therefore he promises salvation, let us think of his strength and
power.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If I shall give.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">This is an elliptical form of expression; and
we are taught by it the sacredness and solemnity of an oath. The import of this
declaration is, as if he had said, that he wishes that henceforth he may not be
believed, if these promises be not justified by the event. When he promises the
peaceful enjoyment of wheat and wine, he means that it proceeded from his
righteous judgment, and did not happen by chance, that the Church was deprived
of corn and wine; for whenever enemies ravage and plunder, this is
unquestionably done by God's permission; as he threatens in the Law.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;052833&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy

confirmation of the preceding statement; for, after having testified that he
will no longer permit that which the Church possesses to be laid open as a prey,
he adds that she shall enjoy her possessions. Yet he shews that "corn and wine"
are justly called our own, when we have obtained them by honest industry; for
they who violently seize the bread of others, or obtain it by unlawful means,
have it not from the Lord, and cannot attribute it to his blessing, as if they
possessed it lawfully; and to this corresponds what is said in the
Psalm,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Thou shalt eat the labor

cultivate the soil shall have food, why does he say that they will give thanks
to God? And why do men praise God, if by their own labor they gather the corn
and procure the wine? It appears to be but a pretended thanksgiving, if those
things are ascribed to the toil and industry of men; and God deserves no praise,
if men procure food by their own labor. But it ought to be observed, that the
Prophet, after having shewn what is the lawful method of seeking food, at the
same time adds that our labor will be fruitless, if the Lord do not supply us
with food; for all that we have belongs to God, and to him alone all that we
obtain ought to be
ascribed.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall drink wine in

the city, which formerly were shut or in a ruinous state; shut when it was
besieged by enemies; in a ruinous state, when the city was thrown down and
levelled with the ground. He means that there shall be such a restoration of the
city, that its inhabitants shall be numerous, and there shall be frequent
passing to and from it.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Some think that these
words are addressed to the pastors, that they may enter in at the gates, and go
before others as their conductors. But it is a general and figurative statement,
by which he compares the Church to a populous city, though for a time it was
ruinous and desolate, as Jerusalem had been. Others pursue more ingenious
speculations, and say that the gates of a Church are opened, when pardon of sins
is proclaimed in it, and by that message God invites all to come to him. But if
we wish to get at the Prophet's meaning, we must believe that all these things
are spoken figuratively, as we have already
mentioned.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Clear the way for
the people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is, strictly speaking, the
duty of teachers; but the Prophet speaks in general terms, and addresses all
whose agency the Lord employed for preparing the way for the people. At that
time, indeed, he spoke to Medes and Persians, by means of whom he opened up the
way for the Jews, that they might return to their native country; but next he
includes all others by whom the Lord restored his
Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Level, level the
road.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He authoritatively commands all men to
"clear and level the roads;" that the Jews might know that every obstacle shall
easily be removed, and that all men, however inveterate their hostility, shall
immediately obey the command of God. In this way he enjoins believers to gird
themselves manfully for the work, as if many workmen were ready to give
assistance, and the emphatic repetition of the word ("Level, level") deserves
notice as intended to express
certainty.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pave it with
stones.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lqs</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>sikkel</i>) sometimes means to remove stones, and sometimes to pave with
stones; and I think that it ought rather to be understood here in this latter
signification, though commentators are generally of a different opinion. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1013</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lift
up a standard to the peoples.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is of the
same import with the former clause; for the Prophet means that the peoples shall
obey the command of God, in the same manner as subjects are wont to obey
princes; for they shall assemble and run together when "the standard is lifted
up," and shall lend their aid to bring back the people; and thus he extols in
lofty terms the power of God, that the Jews might be fully persuaded that they
would one day be restored. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1014</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, Jehovah hath,
proclaimed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He means that the Lord, by acting
miraculously and beyond the judgment or expectation of the flesh, will cause all
the nations to know that this is done by his command. It might be objected, How
shall it be brought about that the peoples, who now make fierce resistance to
God, shall become obedient to him? He assigns the reason, "Because the Lord will
proclaim your return, so that they shall acknowledge that at his command you are
restored."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Say ye to the
daughter of Zion.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Undoubtedly this refers
literally to the ministers of the word and to the prophets, whom the Lord
invests with this office of promising deliverance and salvation to the Church.
And hence we conclude that these promises are not merely limited to a single
age, but must be extended to the end of the world; for, beginning at the return
from Babylon into Judea, we must advance as far as the coming of Christ, by
which this prophecy was at length accomplished, and redemption was brought to a
conclusion; for the Savior came, when the grace of God was proclaimed by the
Gospel. In a word, he foretells that the voice of God shall one day resound from
the rising to the setting of the sun, and shall be heard, not by a single nation
only, but by all
nations.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, the Savior
cometh.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is a word which, we know, belongs
peculiarly to the Gospel; and therefore he bids the teachers of the Church
encourage the hearts of believers, by confirmed expectation of the coming of the
Lord, though he appeared to be at a great distance from his people. But this
promise relates chiefly to the reign of Christ, by which these things were fully
and perfectly accomplished; for he actually exhibited himself as the "Savior" of
his Church, as we have seen before in the fortieth
chapter.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, his reward is
with him, and the effect of his work is before
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> That they may no longer be distressed by
any doubt, when God the Savior shall appear, he invests him with power, as in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234010&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
40:10; for he repeats the same words which we found in that passage. As if he
had said, "As soon as it shall please God to display his hand, the effect will
be rapid and sudden; for so long as he stops or delays, the judgment of the
flesh pronounces him to be idle;" and we see how very many fanatics imagine some
deity that has no existence, as if they were painting a dead image. Justly,
therefore, does the Prophet declare that God's "work and reward are before him,"
that he may make it evident, whenever it shall be necessary, that he is the
righteous Judge of the world.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall call you a
holy people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He describes the benefit of the
coming of the Lord; that is, because, by shewing that he takes care of his elect
as his heritage, he will make it evident to the whole world that the covenant of
adoption, which he made with Abraham, was not deceptive. He therefore calls them
"a holy people," because the Lord hath separated and consecrated them to
himself; for, although he governs all nations, he has deigned to choose the seed
of Abraham, that he might make them the object of his peculiar care.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021906&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
19:6.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The redeemed of
Jehovah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In the sense now stated, God declares
that they shall be a holy people, when he shall appear as their Savior and
Redeemer; for, as the people are said to be "profaned" when they lie amidst
filth, being afflicted and distressed by the reproaches of the wicked, so they
are said to be "sanctified," when the Lord actually shews that he presides over
their salvation. This was accomplished by a wonderful redemption; and at that
time God also testified that he remembered his heritage, which, in the eyes of
men, he appeared to have forsaken and disregarded; for in these words, Sought
out, 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1015</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
not forsaken, is denoted a contrast between the time when God made a divorce
from his people, and the time when he again reconciled to himself those whom he
had cast off.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is this that cometh from
Edom?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This chapter has been violently distorted
by Christians, as if what is said here related to Christ, whereas the Prophet
speaks simply of God himself; and they have imagined that here Christ is red,
because he was wet with his own blood which he shed on the cross. But the
Prophet meant nothing of that sort. The obvious meaning is, that the Lord comes
forth with red garments in the view of his people, that all may know that he is
their protector and avenger; for when the people were weighed down by
innumerable evils, and at the same time the Edomites and other enemies, as if
they had been placed beyond the reach of all danger, freely indulged in
wickedness, which remained unpunished, a dangerous temptation might arise, as if
these things happened by chance, or as if God did not care for his people, or
chastised them too severely. If the Jews were punished for despising God, much
more the Edomites, and other avowed enemies of the name of God, ought to have
been punished.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet meets this very
serious temptation by representing God the avenger as returning from the
slaughter of the Edomites, as if he were drenched with their blood. There is
great liveliness and energy in a description of this sort, Who is this? for that
question raises the hearts of the hearers into a state of astonishment, and
strikes them more forcibly than a plain narrative. On this account the Prophet
employed it, in order to arouse the hearts of the Jews from their slumbering and
stupefaction.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We know that the Edomites were
somewhat related to the Jews by blood; for they were descended from the same
ancestors, and derived their name from Esau, who was also called Edom.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;013601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
36:1, 8, 9.) Having corrupted the pure worship of God, though they bore the same
mark of circumcision, they persecuted the Jews with deadly hatred. They likewise
inflamed the rage of other enemies against the Jews, and shewed that they took
great pleasure in the ruin of that people, as is evident; from the encouraging
words addressed by them to its
destroyers.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Remember, O Lord,
(says the Psalmist,) the children of Edom, who, in the day of the destruction of
Jerusalem, said, Raze, raze it even to the foundations."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D707&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
137:7.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Prophet, therefore, threatens that
judgment shall be passed on the Edomites, that none may imagine that they shall
escape punishment for that savage cruelty with which they burned towards their
brethren; for God will punish all wicked men and enemies of the Church in such a
manner as to shew that the Church is the object of his
care.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Beautiful in his
raiment.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Because spots of blood pollute and
stain the conquerors, Isaiah affirms that God will nevertheless be "beautiful in
his raiment," after having taken vengeance on the enemies. In like manner, we
have seen in other passages
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
34:6) that the slaughter of the wicked is compared to sacrifices, because the
glory of God shines brightly in them; for can we conceive of any ornament more
lovely than judgment? Thus, in order to impress men with reverence for God's
righteous vengeance, he pronounces the blood with which he was sprinkled, by
slaying and destroying the wicked, to be highly beautiful and ornamental. As if
he had said, "Think not that God will resemble a person of mean rank. Though he
be drenched with blood, yet this will not prevent his glory and majesty from
shining brightly."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Marching in
the greatness of his strength.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Various
expositions of the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h[x</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>tzogneh</i>) are given by the Jews. Some view it in a transitive sense, as
referring to the people whom the Lord brought back from captivity. Others refer
it to the nations whom the Lord will remove to another country, though they
appear to have a settled habitation. But I consider it to he more agreeable to
the context to give to it an absolute sense as a noun. The Prophet, therefore,
describes God's majestic march and heroic firmness, by which he displays vast
power.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I who
speak.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Lord himself replies; and this
carries much more authority than if the Prophet spoke in his own person.
Believers are reminded by him of former predictions, that they may know that in
the judgments of God not only his justice and goodness, but likewise his
faithfulness is manifested. As if he had said, "Behold, ye now see fulfilled
what I have already and frequently testified to you by my servants. This effect
of my promises clearly shews that I am true, and that I speak justly and
sincerely, and not for the purpose of deceiving you." The vision would have been
little fitted to strike their minds, if the Jews had not remembered those
promises which they formerly heard; but since the design of it was, that they
should rely on God's salvation, he at the same time claims for himself no
ordinary power to save.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore is thy raiment
red?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He proceeds with the same subject; but, as
it would have impaired the force of the narrative, he does not immediately
explain whence came the red color of God's garments, but continues to put
questions, that he may arouse their minds to the consideration of what is
strange and uncommon. He means that this sprinkling of blood is something
remarkable and extraordinary. The comparison drawn from a "wine-press" is highly
appropriate; for the town Bozrah, which he mentioned a little before, lay in a
vine-bearing district. As if he had said, "There will be other vintages than
those which are customary; for blood shall be shed instead of the juice of the
grapes."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>Alone have I pressed the wine-press.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
The Prophet now explains the vision, and the reason why the Lord was stained
with blood. It is because he will take vengeance on the Edomites and other
enemies who treated his people cruelly. It would be absurd to say that these
things relate to Christ, because he alone and without human aid redeemed us; for
it means that God will punish the Edomites in such a manner that he will have no
need of the assistance of men, because he will be sufficiently able to destroy
them. The Jews might have objected that the Edomites are powerful, and are not
harassed by any wars, but are in a flourishing and tranquil condition. The
Prophet shews that this does not prevent the Lord from inflicting punishment on
them whenever he shall think proper. Human means were, indeed, employed by him
when he took vengeance on the Edomites, but in such a manner that it was made
evident to all that it was entirely directed by his hand, and that no part of it
could be ascribed to human forces or counsels. They were overwhelmed by sudden
and unlooked-for destruction, of which the people ought not to have doubted that
God, who had so often warned them of it, was the
author.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And of the peoples
there was none with me. </i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1016</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This is added in order to intimate that, although "peoples" will arise out of
the earth in order to destroy the nation of Edom, yet the work of God shall be
separate from them, because nothing was farther from the design of heathen
nations than to inflict punishment on the Edomites for their unjust cruelty. For
this reason the Lord wishes his judgment to be known and to be illustriously
displayed amidst the din of arms and tempestuous
commotions.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I will tread
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I willingly retain the future tense; for
the Prophet speaks of events that are future and not yet accomplished; and
although the Edomites were living in prosperity and at their ease, yet God would
severely punish them on account of their cruelty. Why the Prophet makes use of
the metaphor of a bloody wine-press, which is a shocking and melancholy sight,
we have already in part explained; but it ought likewise to be added, that the
punishments and vengeance which God inflicts on enemies are appropriately called
his vintage, as if he gathered them when he ruins or destroys them. In like
manner, such punishment is called in another passage
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;233406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
34:6) a solemn sacrifice; that we may learn that glory ought to be ascribed to
God, not less when he executes his judgments than when he exhibits tokens of
compassion. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1017</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
I will stain all my raiment.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He nevertheless
describes his amazing love toward the Jews, in deigning to sprinkle himself with
the blood of enemies on their account; and that is the reason why he makes use
of the word stain.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In my
wrath.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He shews that this is of itself
sufficient for destroying the Edomites, that the Lord is angry with them; as if
he had said that there will be none to rescue them, when the Lord shall be
pleased to chastise, Hence we may infer that the destruction of men proceeds
from nothing else than the wrath of God; as, on the other hand, on his graco
alone depends our salvation. In a word, God intended here to testify that the
Edomites shall not remain unpunished for having persecuted the Church of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>For the day of vengeance is in my
heart.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In the former clause of this verse
Isaiah intimates that God does not cease to discharge his office, though he does
not instantly execute his judgments, but, on the contrary, delays till a
seasonable time, which he knows well; and that it does not belong to us to
prescribe to him when or how he ought to do this or that, but we ought to bow
submissively to his decree, that he may administer all things according to his
pleasure. Let us not, therefore, imagine that he is asleep, or that he is idle,
when he delays.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the year
of my redeemed is come.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In this latter clause
he shews that all these things are done for the sake of believers. "Day" and
"year" are here used by him in the same sense; but by the word "year" is denoted
the long duration of the captivity, that the Jews may not despair or grow faint
and weary, if the redemption be long delayed. The Lord therefore punishes and
destroys wicked men for the purpose of delivering the godly and of redeeming his
Church, for which he has a special
regard.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Finally, by the slaughter and
destruction of them he opens up a way for his grace. And this tends to our
consolation, that whenever we see tokens of God's wrath toward the wicked, we
may know that the fruit of the punishment which they endure will come to us; for
in this way it is clearly seen that our groans are heard, and that God, when he
wishes to relieve the afflicted, is armed with strength to put to flight all the
enemies of his Church. Wherefore, although the cross be heavy to us, yet by
hearing patiently let us learn to lift up our minds by hope to that "year" which
God hath appointed for executing his
vengeance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I looked, and there was none
to help.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Although the Jews were destitute of
all assistance, and no one aided them by word or deed, yet he shews that the arm
of the Lord is alone sufficient to punish enemies, and to set his people at
liberty. He shews, therefore, that from God alone they ought to expect
salvation, that they may not gaze around in every direction, but may have their
eyes wholly fixed on God, who has no need of the assistance of
others.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I
wondered.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He represents God as amazed that
there is none to stretch out a hand to him, when he wishes to execute his
judgments, that he may impress more deeply on the minds of believers this
doctrine, that God has no need of human aid, and that he is sufficient of
himself for procuring salvation to his people. By this circumstance he magnifies
still more the assistance which he had determined to render to his people,
partly to correct their distrust, and partly to exhort them to gratitude in
future; for God assumes a different character, when he says that he stood like
one astonished; because this stupidity belonged literally to the Jews, who
scarcely believed what could not be done by the power of men. With every
assistance, therefore, he contrasts his own arm, with the invincible power of
which he says that he will be satisfied, both that he may be seen to be their
Savior, and that he may scatter and lay low all the
wicked.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will tread down the
peoples.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> From the preceding statement he draws
the conclusion, that God's wrath is sufficiently powerful to destroy the wicked,
without calling for the assistance of others; and he does so in order that the
Jews may not be deterred from cherishing favorable hopes by the strength that is
arrayed against them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And will
make them drunk.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The expression, "make drunk,"
must here be taken in a different sense from what it formerly had in some
passages. We have seen that sometimes we are made drunk, when God strikes us
with fury or madness,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;232909&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
29:9,) or with a spirit of giddiness,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;231914&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
19:14,) or, in a word, "gives us up to a reprobate mind."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:28.) But here it means nothing else than "to fill," and to strike even to
satiety, or, as we commonly say, (tout leur saoul,) "to their heart's content;"
a metaphor which the prophets frequently
employ.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And will cast down
their strength to the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. That is, though
they think that they are invincible, yet I will cast down and destroy them. The
meaning may be thus summed up. "The Jews, when they are afflicted, must not call
in question their salvation, as if God hated them, and must not be amazed at the
chastisements which they endure, as if they happened by chance; for other
nations, by whom they are now oppressed, shall be punished, there shall be a
revolution of affairs, and they shall not escape who chant a triumph before the
time. He produces as an example the Edomites, because they were nearer and
better known than others, and were also the most
injurious.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will keep in remembrance
the compassions of Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Isaiah brings
consolation to his people in distressed and calamitous circumstances, and by his
example bids the Jews, when they were oppressed by afflictions, call to
remembrance God's ancient benefits, and betake themselves to prayer; that they
may not be like hypocrites, who only in prosperity feel the goodness of God, and
are so much cast down by adversity as to remember no benefit. But when the Lord
chastises us, we ought to mention and celebrate his benefits, and to cherish
better hopes for the future; for the Lord is always the same, and does not
change his purpose or his inclination; and therefore if we leave room for his
compassion, we shall never be left
destitute.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Such appears to me to be the scope of
the context, though others view it in a different light, namely, that the
Prophet, having hitherto spoken of the destruction of the people, comforts
himself by this confident hope of compassion, that God wishes to save some of
them. But they are mistaken in supposing that Isaiah has hitherto spoken of the
Jews, as if God punished them only, whereas he testified that he would likewise
punish other nations, that they might not think that they alone were hated by
God; and accordingly, he now exhorts them to celebrate the remembrance of those
benefits which God had formerly bestowed on the fathers, that by their example
they may know better the love of God toward them. From the context it will also
appear clearly, that the Jews are joined with their fathers, that the covenant
which belongs to them in common with their fathers, may encourage them to hope
well.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As upon all that Jehovah
hath bestowed on us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He employs the particle of
comparison, As, in order to shew that in adversity we ought instantly to
remember those benefits which the Lord bestowed on his people, as if they were
placed before our eyes, though they appear to be buried by extreme old age; for
if they do not belong to us, the remembrance of them would be idle and
unprofitable.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He confirms this also by saying
<i>on us.</i> Because the Jews were members of the same body, he justly reckons
them the descendants of their grandfathers and other ancestors. Isaiah did not,
indeed, experience those benefits which he mentions; but because they had been
bestowed on the Church, the fruit of them came partly to himself, because he was
a member of the Church. And undoubtedly that communion of saints which we
profess to believe, ought to be so highly valued by us, as to lead us to think
that what the Church has received from the hand of God has been given to us; for
the Church of God is one, and that which now is has nothing separate from that
which formerly was. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1018</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In
the multitude of kindness toward the house of Israel.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">By these words Isaiah more fully explains his
meaning. Since therefore the Lord shewed himself to be kind and bountiful toward
his people, we ought to hope for the same thing in the present day, because we
are "fellow-citizens," and members of the very same Church.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:19.) Although we feel that God is angry with us on account of our sins, yet
our hearts ought to be encouraged by hope and armed by confidence; because he
cannot forsake his Church. Yet it ought to be carefully observed, that the
Prophet extols and magnifies in lofty terms the mercy of God, that we may know
that the foundation of our salvation and of all blessings is laid on it; for
this excludes the merits of men, that nothing may in any way be ascribed to
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">That this doctrine may be better
understood, we must take into account the time of which Isaiah speaks. At that
time righteousness and godliness chiefly flourished; for although the people
were exceedingly corrupted, yet Moses, Aaron, and other good men, gave
illustrious examples of unblamable and holy lives. Yet the Prophet shews that
all the blessings which the Lord. bestowed on Moses and others ought to be
ascribed, not to their merits, but to the mercy of God. But what are we in
comparison of Moses, that we should deserve anything from God? This repetition,
therefore, of kindness, mercies, and compassions, as it raises feeble minds on
high, that they may rise above stupendous and formidable temptations, ought also
to remove and swallow up all thought of human
merits.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>

43:21; 55:5.) Justly, therefore, does the Lord say that he elected the people,
that they might be holy and true, that he might have children who were averse to
falsehood and vanity. But the people did not keep their promise, and were far
removed from that simplicity which they ought to have followed; for everything
was full of deceit and hypocrisy. Yet nevertheless he holds out the hope of
pardon, provided that they fly to God and humble themselves by sincere
repentance.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore he
became their Savior.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet shews what is
the chief part of the service of God; namely, to have a pure and upright heart.
Hence it follows that God forsakes us, because we are treacherous and are
covenant-breakers. Seeing therefore that this people took pleasure in their
vices, it was proper first to convict them of their unbelief, that being
afterwards converted to God, they might find him to be their
Savior.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.

they permitted themselves to be governed by him, and was so careful about them
that he himself bore their distresses and afflictions. By speaking in this
mainner, he declares the incomparable love which God bears toward his people. In
order to move us more powerfully and draw us to himself, the Lord accommodates
himself to the manner of men, by attributing to himself all the affection, love,
and
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sumpaqei&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">)
compassion which a father can have. And yet in human affairs it is impossible to

figure of speech, he assumes and applies to himself human passions.

because he was the witness of the presence of God, and, as it were, his herald
to execute his commands; that we may not think that angels come forth of their
own accord, or move at their own suggestion, to render assistance to us; for the
Lord makes use of their agency, and makes known to us his presence by means of
them. Angels can do nothing of themselves, and give no assistance, except so far

thought preferable to interpret this phrase as describing the lively image of

face of God as in a mirror, that meaning will be highly appropriate. And indeed
I have no doubt that the office of Savior is ascribed to Christ, as we know that
he was the angel of highest rank, by whose guidance, safeguard, and protection,
the Church has been preserved and
upheld.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In his

benefits; namely, his love and undeserved kindness, as Moses also teaches. "How

heart clave to them?"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050437&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
4:37; 7:7, 8.) Moses wishes to set aside entirely the lofty opinion which they
might entertain of themselves, because they were proud and haughty, and claimed
more for themselves than they had a right to claim; and therefore he shews that
there was no other cause for so great benefits than the absolute and undeserved
goodness of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He bore them
and carried them</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He next makes use of the same
metaphor which Moses employs in his song, when he says that God</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"carried his people in
the same manner as an eagle bears her young on her wings."

only carries the child in the womb, but rears it till it arrive at full
strength. The meaning may be thus summed up. "The people experienced the grace
of God, not only once, when they were redeemed, but during the whole course of
their life, so that to him alone ought to be ascribed all the benefits which
they have received." And therefore he adds
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All the days of the
age</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, in an uninterrupted succession of
many years; for God is not wearied in doing good, nor is it only to a single age

Church with various gifts.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But they were
rebellious.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet now comes down to the
second clause, in which he states that the Lord ceased to shew kindness to his
people, because they revolted, and turned aside from him. The question turns on
this point: "God exercised his kindness towards our fathers for a long time; why
do not we experience the same kindness? Is he unlike himself?" By no means; but
we ourselves, by our rebellion, refuse and even drive away his goodness. Yet the
Prophet not only accuses the men of his own age, but likewise condemns former
ages. We see how, even when they had Moses for their leader, they murmured
against God and rebelled.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021705&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus

became an enemy to them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He shews that the
effect of their rebellion was, that God, who had loved them tenderly, yet, in
consequence of their obstinacy, "became an enemy to them." Let them accuse
themselves, therefore, for suffering the punishment of their transgressions; for
God is by nature disposed to shew kindness, and nothing is more agreeable to him
than to bestow his favors.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
they provoked his Holy Spirit.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We are said to
irritate "the Holy Spirit" by our wickedness; and this form of expression, after
the manner of men, is intended to produce in us stronger abhorrence against sin,
which provokes God's wrath and hatred. Now, since it is the same Spirit that
performs the work of our salvation, the Prophet suggests that God is alienated
from us by our sins, which break asunder the bond of union. To this belongs the
exhortation of Paul,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Grieve not; the Spirit
of God, by whom ye have been sealed to the day of redemption."

<div><font face="Palatino">It ought also to be observed here, that we have no
reason for blaming men, who hate and persecute us, seeing that the Lord makes
war with us, and punishes our transgressions by their hand. We ought therefore
to accuse and condemn our transgressions; for they are the cause of all the
evils which we endure.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he remembered the days of
old.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is the design of the chastisement,
that the people may be roused from their lethargy, and may call to remembrance
those things which they had formerly forgotten; for we are so intoxicated by
prosperity that we altogether forget God. And therefore chastisements bring back
this thought, which had been defaced in us, "Where is God who bestowed so many
benefits on our fathers?" For I refer these things to the past time; and
therefore I have translated
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;lw[</font><font face="Palatino">
(gnolam) "of old." and not "of the age," which would be unsuitable to this
passage, seeing that he mentions those times in which Moses governed the people
of God. Wherefore, the true meaning is, that the Jews, being wretchedly
oppressed, thought of "the times of old," in which the Lord displayed his power
for defending his people. As to the opinion of some commentators, who refer it
to God, as if he contended with the wickedness of the people, because he chose
rather to bestow his favors improperly on ungrateful persons, than not to
complete what he had begun, it appears to be too harsh and unnatural; and
therefore the Prophet rather utters the groans and complaints of a wretched
people, when they have learned from chastisements how miserable it is to lose
God's protection.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With the
shepherd of his flock</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By "the shepherd" he
means Moses, and I see no good reason for translating it in the plural rather
than the singular number. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1020</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That
put his Holy Spirit in the midst of him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He
describes also the manner; namely, that he endowed him with a remarkable grace
of the Holy Spirit; for "to put the Spirit in the midst of him" means nothing
else than to display the power of his Spirit. Others prefer to view it as
referring to the people; and I do not object to that opinion. But when the Lord
chose Moses, and appointed him to be the leader of the whole people, in him
especially the Lord is said to have "put his Spirit." Now, he gave his Spirit to
him for the benefit of the whole people, that he might be a distinguished
minister of his grace, and might restore them to liberty. At the same time, the
power of the Spirit of God was seen in the midst of the whole
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who led
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he goes on to describe the
miraculous deliverance of the people, who were led out of Egypt under the
guidance of Moses; and he goes on to relate the complaints which might occur to
the minds of the afflicted Jews. Here we see two things connected; namely, the
right hand of Moses and the arm of God's majesty. The Lord employs the labors
and ministry of men in such a manner that his praise and glory must not be in
any degree diminished or obscured; for, while these things are transacted under
Moses as the leader, everything is ascribed to God. Just as, when the ministers
of the Gospel are said to "forgive sins,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;432023&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
20:23,) which nevertheless belongs to God alone, does this detract from his
authority and majesty? Not at all; for they are only his instruments, and lend
their labor to God, to whom the undivided praise ought to be rendered. And
indeed, what could the hand of a single man have accomplished, if it had not
been wielded by the arm of God?</font><br><font face="Palatino">Accordingly, he
expressly adds the design, that God performed miracles at that time, in order
that he might gain for himself an everlasting name; and if we are not at liberty
to deprive him of this, it will not be lawful to transfer to man even the
smallest portion of praise.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who made them walk through
the depths.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> These things are added for the
purpose of setting that benefit in a stronger light. He likewise brings forward
comparisons, in order to describe that extraordinary power of God: "As a horse
in the desert, As a beast into a plain;" that is, he led out his people as
gently as if one were leading a horse into a plain. By the word "desert" is not
meant the wilderness of Paran in which the people dwelt forty years; but, in
accordance with the ordinary usage of the Hebrew tongue, it denotes pasture, in
which herds and flocks wander at large. This is still more evident from the
following verse, &#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As a beast into a
plain.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here, instead of "desert," he makes use
of the word "plain;" and the same meaning is drawn from what he says, that "the
people walked through the depths without stumbling, as horses are wont to do in
the desert." In a word, he informs them that the Red Sea was no obstacle to the
people marching through the midst of the depths, as if they were walking on
level ground. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1021</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A
glorious name.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is in the same sense that
he called it a little before "an everlasting name." The people now argue with
God, that if he once wished to obtain "a glorious name," he must not now throw
away all care about it; otherwise the remembrance of the benefits which he
formerly bestowed on the fathers will be entirely blotted
out.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Look down from heaven.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">After having, in the name of the whole people,
related the benefits of former times, he now applies this to the present
subject, and entreats the Lord to pay regard to his
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold from the
habitation of thy holiness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By these words he
means that the power of God is not diminished, though this does not always
appear; for we must supply a contrast, that God at that time might be said to be
concealed, and did not shew himself to them as he had shewn himself to the
fathers. "Although, therefore, we do not see thee, O Lord, and although thou
hast withdrawn from us as if thou wert shut up in heaven, so that thou mayest
seem to have altogether ceased to care about us, yet 'look down from heaven, and
from thy habitation' behold our distresses." Believers must differ from
unbelievers in acknowledging a powerful and kind God, even when they perceive no
tokens of his power or kindness; and thus, even when he is at a great distance,
they nevertheless call on him; for God never ceases to care about his people,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600507&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 5:7,) since he governs unceasingly every part of the
world.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Where is thy
zeal?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By these questions believers appear in
some measure to reproach God, as if he were not now moved by any affection
toward them, or as if his power were diminished; but the Prophet's meaning is
different; for in thus extolling those benefits, his object is, as I have
already remarked, to confirm the hope of believers for the future, that they may
know that God is always like himself, and will never lay aside his care about
his people. This will appear more clearly from what
follows.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The multitude of
bowels and of compassions</i></font><font face="Palatino"> denotes God's vast
goodness; for God displays and opens up his bowels, so to speak, when he
exercises toward us bounty and kindness, which truly is so great that we cannot
praise it in adequate language. Nor is it a new thing that believers, when
oppressed by grief, expostulated familiarly with God for shutting up his bowels.
They do indeed hold by this principle, that God is always compassionate, because
he does not change his nature; and though they impute it to their sins that they
do not experience him to be compassionate, yet, that they may not sink into
despair, they ask how it is possible that God should treat them with severity,
and, as if he had forgotten his natural disposition, should shew nothing but
tokens of absolute displeasure? 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1022</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Surely thou art our
Father.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> God permits us to reveal our hearts
familiarly before him; for prayer is nothing else than the opening up of our
heart before God; as the greatest alleviation is, to pour our cares, distresses,
and anxieties into his bosom. "Roll thy cares on the Lord," says David.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193705&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
37:5.) After having enumerated God's benefits, from which his goodness and power
are clearly seen, so that it is evident that it is nothing else than the sins of
men that hinder them from feeling it as formerly, he returns to this
consideration, that the goodness of God is nevertheless so great as to exceed
the wickedness of men. He calls God a Father in the name of the Church; for all
cannot call him thus, but it is the peculiar privilege of the Church to address
him by a father's name. Hence it ought to be inferred that Christ, as the
first-born, or rather the only-begotten Son of God, always governed his Church;
for in no other way than through him can God be called Father. And here we again
see that believers do not contend with God, but draw an argument from his
nature, that, by conquering temptation, they may strive to cherish good
hope.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Though Abraham do not
know us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here a question arises, Why does he
say that the patriarch does not know the people? Jerome thinks that this is done
because they were degenerated, and therefore were unworthy of so high an honor;
but that interpretation appears to me to be exceedingly unnatural. The true
meaning is, "Though our fathers deny us, yet God will reckon us as children, and
will act toward us as a Father."</font><br><font face="Palatino">They who say
that Abraham and other believers care no more about the affairs of men, torture
by excessive ingenuity the words of the Prophet. I do not speak of the fact
itself, but I say that those words do not prove that the saints have no care
about us. The natural and true meaning is, "O Lord, that thou art our Father
will be so sure and so firmly established, that even though all parentage and
all relationship should cease among men, yet thou wilt not fail to be our
Father. Sooner shall the rights of nature perish than thou shalt not act toward
us as a Father, or the sacred adoption shall be infringed, which was founded on
thy unchangeable decree, and ratified by the death of thine only-begotten Son." 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1023</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">Yet
we may infer from this that holy men present themselves before God, and pray to
him, in such a manner as not to look at any intercessions of others; for they
are commanded to pray so as to rely on God's fatherly kindness, and to lay aside
every other confidence. And if the Prophet did not instruct the Jews, in order
that God might listen to them, to turn their mind to Abraham and Jacob, to whom
promises so numerous and so great had been given, assuredly much less ought we
to resort, to Peter, and Paul, and others; for this is not a private prayer
offered by a single individual or by a few persons, but the public and universal
prayer of the whole Church, as if the Prophet laid down a general form. Besides,
our confidence ought to be founded on God's favor and kindness as a Father, so
as to shut our eyes on all the intercessions of men, whether living or dead. In
a word, believers profess that they do not gaze around in all directions, but
rely on God alone.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It comes now to a question,
Why did he pass by Isaac and mention in a special manner Abraham and Jacob? The
reason is, that with those two persons the covenant was more solemnly ratified.
Isaac was, indeed, a partaker of the covenant, but did not receive promises so
large and so numerous.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Our
Redeemer.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Redemption is here described as a
testimony of that adoption; for by this proof God manifested himself to be the
Father of the people; and therefore boldly and confidently do believers call on
God as their Father, because he gave a remarkable testimony of his fatherly
kindness toward them, which encouraged them to confidence. But redemption alone
would, not have been enough, if a promise had not likewise been added; and
therefore, as he once redeemed them, he promised that he would always be their
Father.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From everlasting is
thy name.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By the word "everlasting" 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1024</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is pointed out the stability and continuance of his fatherly name, for we did
not deserve the name of children; but his will, by which he once adopted us to
be children, is unchangeable. Since, therefore, the Lord has an eternal name, it
follows that the title and favor which are connected with that eternity and flow
from it, shall be durable and eternal. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1025</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why didst thou cause as to
wander, O Jehovah, from thy ways?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Because these
modes of expression appear to be rough and harsh, some think that unbelievers
are here introduced as murmuring against God and uttering blasphemies, with the
rage and obstinacy of men who are in a state of despair. But the connection in
which these words occur does not at all admit of that interpretation; for the
Prophet points out the fruit that would result from the calamities and
afflictions of the Jews, because, having been subdued and tamed, they no longer
are fierce or indulge in their vices. They are therefore ashamed that in time
past they departed so far from the right way, and they acknowledge their own
fault.</font><br><font face="Palatino">And indeed when they trace their sins to
the wrath of God, they do not intend to free themselves from blame, or to set
aside their guilt. But the Prophet employs a mode of expression which is of
frequent occurrence; for in the Scriptures it is frequently said that God drives
men into error,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;530211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Thessalonians 2:11;) "gives them up to a reprobate mind,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:28;) and "hardens them."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450918&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:18.) When believers speak in this manner, they do not intend to make God the
author of error or of sin, as if they were innocent, or to free themselves from
blame; but they look higher, and rather acknowledge that it is by their own
fault that they are estranged from God and deprived of his Spirit, and that this
is the reason why they are plunged into every kind of
evils.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Those who say that God leads us into
error by privation, that is, by depriving us of his Spirit, do not perceive the
actual design; for God himself is said to harden and to blind, when he gives up
men to be blinded by Satan, who is the minister and executioner of his wrath.
Without this we would be exposed to the rage of Satan; but, since he can do
nothing without the command of God, to whose dominion he is subject, there will
be no impropriety in saying that God is the author of blinding and hardening, as
Scripture also affirms in many passages.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450918&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:18.) And yet it cannot be said or declared that God is the author of sin,
because he punishes the ingratitude of men by blinding them in this
manner.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Thus believers here acknowledge that God
has forsaken them, but that it is by their own fault;  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1026</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and they acknowledge God's righteous vengeance against them. In like manner,
when Moses says that "God hath not hitherto given to the people eyes to see and
a heart to understand,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;052904&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
29:4,) he does not lay the blame on God, but reminds the Jews whence they should
seek to obtain a remedy for that stupidity of which they had been convicted. Yet
it may appear as if here they aimed at something else, by inquiring into the
cause and remonstrating with God, that he ought to have acted differently
towards them and treated them less harshly. But I reply, that believers always
look at the goodness of God, even when they acknowledge that they suffer justly
on account of their sins.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Some refer these words
to the captivity; as if believers complained that God permitted them to languish
so long in captivity. As if he had said, "The chief cause of their obstinacy is,
that the Lord does not permit them to partake of his grace." Believers are
troubled by a dangerous temptation, when they see wicked men pursuing their
career without being punished, and are almost driven by it to despair; as it is
beautifiully expressed by David.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B503&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
115:3.) But I think that the Prophet's meaning is more general; for believers
acknowledge that they "wandered," because they were not governed by the Spirit
of God; and they do not; expostulate with God, but desire to have that Spirit,
by whom their fathers were guided, and from whom they obtained all
prosperity.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And hast caused
our heart to depart from thy fear.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jy&ccedil;qt</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>takshiach</i>,) is rendered by some, hast hardened; but as that would not
agree with the words, "in thy fear," I have preferred to translate it, "Hast
caused to depart;" for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">j&ccedil;q</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>kashach</i>,) also signifies "to remove and place at a
distance."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Return on account
of thy servants.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some think that these words
relate to the whole people, as Scripture frequently gives the appellation of
"servants of God" to all the citizens of the Church. But I think that they
relate literally to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and that is much more probable;
not that the people relied on their intercession, but because the Lord had made
a covenant with them, which they should transmit from hand to hand to their
posterity. Thus they do not hold out these patriarchs as men, but as ministers
and depositaries or messengers of the covenant which was the foundation of their
confidence. In the same manner, in that psalm,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Lord, remember David,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
132:1,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">the name of the dead patriarch is mentioned to God,
not because the saints thought that he would be their intercessor, but that the
promise given to a single individual, as to establishing the kingdom in his
family for ever, belongs to the body of the
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Papists eagerly seize on these
words, as if they were a proof of the intercessions of the saints. But how easy
it is to reply may be easily seen from the true interpretation; for the fathers
are mentioned, not because they had a right to obtain anything for them, or
because they now intercede, but because with them was formed a gracious
covenant, which belongs not only to themselves, but to all their
posterity.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the tribes of
thine inheritance.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I have added the preposition
To, which was understood, in order that the meaning might be more easy and
obvious. It is a customary form of expression among the Hebrews, "Return the
tribes," instead of "Return to the tribes;" as if he had said, "Return to a
state of friendship with thy people." Hence it is evident that what was formerly
said had no other object than that the people urged God to the exercise of mercy
by representing to God their distresses and calamities. And in this manner we
must come to God; that is, by recounting former benefits and laying before him
our afflictions, if we desire to be delivered from
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He employs the word <i>Inheritance,</i>
because God hath chosen that people to be his heritage; as if he had said,
"Where shall thy people be, if we perish?" Not that the Lord was bound to that
people, but that he had given his promise to them. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1027</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Accordingly, the people venture to remind God of his promise and to offer
earnest prayer, because he had laid himself under a voluntary obligation both to
the fathers and to posterity. Now, since all the promises are ratified and
confirmed in Christ,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470120&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 1:20,) and since we possess the reality of all things, we ought to
be fortified by stronger confidence; for not only was the covenant made in his
hand, but it was ratified and sealed by his blood. To the ancient fathers also
he was indeed the Mediator, but we have everything clearer and plainer; because
they were still kept amidst the darker
shadows.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For a little
time.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is wonderful that the people should
call it "a little time;" for fourteen hundred years had elapsed since the people
began to possess that land. But we must take into account the promise by which
he said that the seed of Abraham should have it as an everlasting inheritance;
and therefore that was a short time, when compared with eternity.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011708&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
17:8; 48:4.) Believers, therefore, represent to God the shortness of that time;
not that they accuse him of insincerity, but that he may remember the promise
and covenant, and may have more regard to his own goodness than to the
chastisements which they justly deserved. Thus the ancient Church complains
that</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"her strength was weakened in
the journey, that her days were shortened, and prays that she may not be cut off
in the middle of her course,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A223&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
102:23, 24,)</font><br><font face="Palatino">that is, because the fullness of
age depended on the coming of
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Our adversaries have
trodden down thy sanctuary.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This was a much
heavier complaint, that wicked men had profaned the land which the Lord had
consecrated to himself. Undoubtedly this was far more distressing to the people
than the rest of their calamities, and justly; for we ought not to care so much
about ourselves as about religion and the worship of God. And this is also the
end of redemption, that there may be a people that praises the name of the Lord
and worships him in a right manner.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have been of
old.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The words of the Prophet admit of two
meanings. Some view this passage in such a light as if the people argued with
God on this ground, that they were elected at that time when the rest of the
nations were rejected, and that this covenant was ratified "from of old," that
is, for a long period. Another meaning, which I prefer, is this, that the people
argue with God, and complain that they seem as if they did not differ at all
from unbelievers; that is, because they receive from him no assistance or relief
in adversity, which is unreasonable and improper. This statement is remarkable
and worthy of notice; for, whenever we are oppressed beyond measure with
adversity, we are permitted to complain to God, and to represent to him our
calling, that he may render assistance, and shew how wide a difference there is
between us and strangers.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On
whom thy name hath not been called.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is of
the same import with what goes before; for it means that the calling of God must
not be made void. And indeed the Lord does not wish that we should call upon him
in vain; for prayers would be unprofitable and useless, if the Lord took no care
of us. Now, the Church is distinguished by this mark, that "his name is called
upon her." Unbelievers cannot call upon him; for there is no access to him but
through the word, of which they have no knowledge; and therefore, wherever there
is faith, there is also calling on him; and if there be no faith, it is certain
that there is no hope or confidence.</font><br></div>

(lu) appears to me, in this passage, to denote a wish; for, although it has many
significations, yet the context shews that this signification is more
appropriate to this passage than any other. Here believers burst forth into
earnest prayer, as usually happens, when in sore adversity we do not find plain
terms to be sufficiently forcible for our
purpose.</font><br><font face="Palatino">God is said to "rend the heavens," when
he unexpectedly gives some uncommon and striking proof of his power; and the
reason of this mode of expression is, not only that men, when they are hard
pressed, commonly look up to heaven, from which they expect assistance, but that
miracles, by interrupting the order of nature, open up for themselves an unusual
path. Now, when God renders no assistance, he appears to be shut up in heaven,
and to disregard what is taking place on earth. For this reason he is said to
open and "rend the heavens," when he holds out to us some testimony of his
presence; because otherwise we think that he is at a great distance from
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That thou wouldest come
down</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This expression, like the former, is
adapted to the estimation of our flesh; for God does not need to move from one

subjects better.

the nations would tremble at thy presence; thine enemies would instantly be
melted away." But I think that the translation which I have given is more
simple; for it is very certain that the Prophet here alludes to Mount Sinai,
where the Lord openly revealed himself to the people. Hence we see also the
gross absurdity of the division of this chapter;

Whenever therefore the prophets mention this history, they include all the
benefits that were ever bestowed by God on his people; not only when he
delivered them from the tyranny of Pharaoh, when he appeared to them in Mount
Sinai, but also when, during forty years, he supplied them with all that was
necessary in the wilderness, when he drove out their enemies, and led them into
the possession of the land of Canaan. In a word, they include all the
testimonies by which he formerly proved himself to be gracious to his people and
formidable to his enemies.</font><br><font face="Palatino">He says that "the
melting fire made the waters boil," because, contrary to custom, fire and
lightning were mingled with violent showers; as if he had said that the fire of
God melted the hardest bodies, and that the waters were consumed by its heat. To
the same purpose is what he adds, that "the mountains flowed at his presence;"
for he opened up a passage for his people through the most dreadful
obstacles.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.

mind.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From of old they have not

already said, that believers do not here ask anything strange or uncommon, but
only that God may shew himself to be to them what he formerly shewed himself to
be to the fathers, and that he may continue to exercise his kindness, and that,
since he has been wont to assist his people, and to give them undoubted tokens
of his presence, he may not cease in future to cause his strength and power to
shine forth more and more brightly. He represents believers as praying to God in
such a manner that they strengthen themselves by the remembrance of the past,
and betake themselves; with greater courage to God's
assistance.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Eye hath not seen
a God besides thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet's design
unquestionably is, to celebrate God's immense goodness, by relating the numerous
benefits which he bestowed upon his people in ancient times; and this kind of
praise is highly magnificent, when, rising to rapturous admiration, of them, he
exclaims that there is no God besides him, and that those things which the Lord
has carried into effect for the sake of his people are unheard-of and uncommon.
But there are two ways in which these words may be read, for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yhla</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>elohim</i>) may either be in the accusative or in the vocative case. "O
Lord, no one hath seen besides thee what thou doest for them that wait for
thee." But another reading is more generally approved, "No one hath ever seen or
ever heard of such a God." Yet in this reading we must supply the particle of
comparison, as; for otherwise the sentence would be incomplete. The verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h&ccedil;[y</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>yagnaseh</i>) is put absolutely, "No ear hath heard, and no eye hath seen,
such a God as doeth such things." And thus God is distinguished from idols, from
which superstitious men imagine that they obtain all good things; for they are
the mere inventions of men, and can do neither good nor harm, seeing that God
bestows on his worshippers benefits of every
kind.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Paul appears to explain this passage
differently, and to torture it to a different purpose, and even quotes it in
different words, that is, because he followed the Greek version.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 2:9.) In this respect the Apostles were not squeamish; for they paid
more attention to the matter than to the words, and reckoned it enough to draw
the attention of the reader to a passage of Scripture, from which might be
obtained what they taught. As to the addition which Paul appears to have made of
his own accord, "Nor hath entered into the heart of man what God hath prepared
for them that love him," he did so for the purpose of explanation; for he added
nothing that does not fully agree with the Prophet's
doctrine.</font><br><font face="Palatino">That we may understand better how
thoroughly he agrees with the Prophet, we must understand his design. In that
passage he treats of the doctrine of the Gospel, which he demonstrates to
surpass the capacity of the human understanding; for it contains knowledge that
is widely different and far removed from the perception of our flesh, and, in
short, is "hidden wisdom," so that Paul is justly led to view it with
astonishment. And as the Prophet, when he takes into consideration the wonderful
acts of God's kindness, exclaims, like one who is lost in amazement, that
nothing like this was ever heard of; so, in the most excellent of all benefits,
namely, that in which Christ is offered to us by the Gospel, we may exclaim in
the same manner, "O Lord, what thou bestowest on thy people exceeds all the
capacity of the human mind: no eye, no ear, no senses, no mind can reach such
loftiness." Thus Paul applies this passage admirably to his reasoning, and does
not make an improper use of the statement made by the Prophet when he elevates
above the world that peculiar grace which God bestows on his
Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There remains but one difficulty,
namely, that Paul applies to spiritual blessings what the Prophet here says
about blessings of a temporal nature. But we may say that Isaiah here looks
merely at the cause of God's benefits, though he has in his eye the condition of
the present life; for all the benefits that we receive from God, for the sake of
food and nourishment, are proofs of his fatherly kindness toward us; and it is
the peculiar excellence of faith, to rise from visible favors to those which are
invisible. Although therefore the Prophet appears to speak of external
deliverance and other benefits of this life, yet he rises higher, and looks
chiefly at those things which belonged especially to the people of God. What
stupidity would it be, if, while we enjoy God's benefits, we did not consider
the fountain itself, that is, his fatherly kindness! Ordinary favors are enjoyed
indiscriminately by the good and the bad; but that favor with which he embraces
us belongs especially to citizens. The consequence is, that we do not merely
observe those things which fall under the senses of men, but contemplate the
cause itself. Although therefore neither eyes nor ears reach so far as to
comprehend the grace of adoption, by which the Lord testifies that he is our
Father, yet he reveals it by the testimony of his
Spirit.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is even probable that the Prophet,
when he spoke of a particular instance of God's kindness, was elevated, by means
of it, to a general reflection; for, in considering God's works, it was frequent
and customary for good men to pass from a single instance to the whole class. In
that way might this single but remarkable instance of the divine goodness raise
the mind of the Prophet to so high a pitch as to meditate on that infinite
abundance of blessings which is laid up for believers in heaven. We even see
clearly that this commendation includes the gracious covenant by which God
adopted the children of Abraham into the hope of eternal life.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011707&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
17:7.) What has been said amounts to this: "Seeing that the goodness and power
of God are so great, we have no reason to distrust him; but we ought to place
our confidence in him, so as to hope that he will assuredly assist us." And such
is the design of those excellent benefits which are here mentioned by the
Prophet.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast
met.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He proceeds with the same subject; for the
people deplore their hard lot, that they feel no alleviation in their adversity,
although formerly God was wont to stretch out the hand to the fathers.
Believers, therefore, speak in this manner: "Thou wast wont to meet our fathers;
now thy face is turned away from us; and thou appearest to be irreconcilable:,
because we gain nothing by calling on thee. Whence comes this diversity, as if
thy nature had been changed, and thou wert now different from what thou hast
been?" They next add, and make an acknowledgment, that they are punished justly,
because "they have sinned." I have formerly stated that nothing is better in
adversity than to remember God's benefits, and not only those which we have
ourselves experienced, but likewise those which are related in Scripture; for we
cannot be armed by a stronger shield against temptations of every
kind.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This verse, in my opinion, is inaccurately
explained by those who think that we ought to read those words as closely
connected, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Him that rejoiceth and
doeth righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> as if he had said,
"Thou hast met them that willingly serve thee, and whose highest pleasure is to
do what is right." I think that rejoicing denotes here those who were glad in
prosperity; for at that time the people were in sadness and mourning. There is
an implied contrast. "Formerly thou wast wont to meet the fathers, before they
were distressed by any affliction, and to cheer them by thy approach; now thou
art far distant, and permittest us to languish in mourning and
grief."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In thy ways they
remembered thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In accordance with what he has
now said, he adds that they "remembered God," because they enjoyed his present
grace, and felt that he was the author and director of their salvation; and so
by "the ways of God," he means prosperity; either that in this way he was near
to them, when he treated them softly and gently as his children, or because God
is by nature inclined to acts of kindness. But since he said that God was wont
to "meet him that doeth righteousness," the "remembrance" may relate to the
practice of piety, that is, that they devoted themselves earnestly to the
worship of God; and so it will be an explanation of the former clause, for the
prophets frequently confirm by a variety of expressions what they have formerly
said. To "remember" God, is to be captivated by the pleasant remembrance of him,
so that we shall desire nothing more, and to place all our happiness in him.
There is nothing that delights us more than the remembrance of the mercy of God;
and, on the other hand, if we feel that God is angry, the mention of him fills
us with alarm.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And we have
sinned.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The reason is assigned; for, when they
find that God is so unlike what he formerly was, they do not murmur against him,
but throw all the blame on themselves. Let us learn from this, that we ought
never to think of the chastisements which the Lord inflicts, without at the same
time calling to mind our sins, that we may confess that we are justly punished,
and may acknowledge our
guilt.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In them is
perpetuity.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In this passage
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;lw[</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>gnolam</i>) denotes nothing else than "long duration;" but it may refer
either to "sins" or to "the ways of the Lord." To sins it may refer in this way,
"Though we obstinately persisted in our sins, and deserved that thou shouldst
destroy us a thousand times, yet hitherto we have been saved by thy mercy." If
we understand it to relate to "the ways of the Lord," it will assign the reason
why the people did not perish, because "the ways of the Lord" are steadfast and
perpetual, and his mercy never comes to an end; and that meaning appears to me
to agree best with this passage. Some supply the words, that "the age," or
"perpetuity," is founded on the ways of the Lord. But I prefer to take the words
in their literal acceptation, as when David says that the Lord "is not angry but
for a moment,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193005&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
30:5,) that he is easy to be reconciled, and always compassionate; for his anger
is not suddenly kindled, or with immoderate rage, after the manner of men, but
he is unchangeable in benevolence and
favor.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And we shall be
saved,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>we have been
saved</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> We have not yet got at the whole
of the Prophet's statement; for he says that the people "are saved," although
they had been led into captivity, as into a grave, and deplored their calamity.
On that account I consider the preterite to be put for the future, for it is
rather a wish or a prayer than an affirmation. Nor do the saints boast that they
have obtained salvation, but, deploring their misery, they betake themselves to
God's everlasting mercy; and consequently, they praise that which they wish, and
not that which they have already obtained.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have all been as the
unclean.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The believers go on in their
complaint; for they deplore their condition, because God appears to take no
account of them. Hebrew writers are not agreed as to the meaning of the words

Yet it is certain that it denotes something which is vile and worthless, and
which, on account of its filthiness, stinks in the noses of men. But here two
things ought to be observed; first, that believers confess their guilt, and are
justly punished for it; and, secondly, that they nevertheless complain of the
severity of the punishments which they endure, not to blame God, but to move him
to compassion; just as a culprit, when he endeavors to mitigate the severity of
a judge, lays before him his own distresses and calamities. Some commentators
torture this passage, by alleging that the Prophet, when he speaks of the
pollutions of sins, describes all Jews without exception, though there still
remained some of them who were sincere worshippers of God. But there are no good
grounds for this; for the Prophet does not speak of individuals, but of the
whole body, which, being trodden under foot by all men, and subjected to the
utmost indignity, he compares to a filthy
garment.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There are some who frequently quote
this passage, in order to prove that so far are our works from having any merit
in them, that they are rotten and loathsome in the sight of God. But this
appears to me to be at variance with the Prophet's meaning, who does not speak
of the whole human race, but describes the complaint of those who, having been
led into captivity, experienced the wrath of the Lord against them, and
therefore, acknowledged that they and their righteousnesses were like a filthy
garment. And first, he exhorts them to a confession of their sin, that they may
acknowledge their guilt; and next, that they should nevertheless ask pardon from
God, the manner of obtaining which is, that, while we complain that we are
wretched and distressed, we at the same time acknowledge that we are justly
punished for our sins.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And we
all fade as a leaf.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is a very beautiful
comparison, which shews that men utterly fade and decay when they feel that God
is angry with them; as is admirably described in
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;199006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
90:6; 103:16. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1034</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Justly, therefore, are we compared to leaves; for "our iniquities, like the
wind, carry us away."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There is none that calleth on
thy name.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He confirms what was formerly said;
for he exhorts believers, even though God's punishment of them appears to be
severe, still to believe that they deserve such a punishment. Heinous sins are
mentioned by him; and though it would be tedious to go over all of them in
detail, he points out the fountain itself, and says that the worship of God is
neglected. Under the word "calleth on," he includes, as is customary in
Scripture, the whole worship of God; for the most important part of God's
worship is to "call upon" him, and to testify our confidence in him. Prayers and
supplications, undoubtedly, were always practiced among them; but, because the
heart was far removed, he reckons all pretended ceremonies as of no
value.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Or that stirreth up
himself to take hold of thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He now explains
more clearly the former clause, by saying that no one earnestly applies his
mind, or gives his endeavor to seek God, but that all are consumed and wasted
away through their own slothfulness. And first, he shews that nothing is more
desirable than to be perfectly joined to God; for, when we are alienated from
him, everything must go ill with us. We are indolent and sluggish by nature; and
therefore we need to have spurs applied to us. Seeing that by nature we indulge
our slothfulness, we must listen to the advice of the Prophet so as not to
become utterly stupid; for, otherwise he in his turn will reject us, or
contemptuously drive us away. The Prophet describes the miserable condition of
the people, in which there was no desire to seek God, and no means were used to
stir up the heart to
godliness.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast made us
to languish.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> They again complain that they are
overwhelmed by the severity of distress, and Obtain from God no alleviation; for
Isaiah asserts these things in the name of the whole people, and prays to God
not to permit them any longer to languish amidst so great
miseries.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And now, O
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> After having complained of their
miseries, by which they were almost overwhelmed, they now more openly ask pardon
from God and a mitigation of their distresses, and with greater boldness plead
with God that still they are his children. Adoption alone could encourage them
to cherish favorable hopes, that they might not cease to rely on their Father,
though overwhelmed by the load of afflictions. And this order should be
carefully observed; for, in order that we may be truly humbled in our hearts, we
need to be cast down, and laid low, and almost crushed. But when despair seizes
us, we must lay hold on this altar of consolation, that, "since God has been
pleased to elect us to be his children, we ought to expect salvation from him,
even when matters are at the worst." Thus, with a view to the gracious covenant,
the Israelites affirm that they are the children of God, in order that they may
experience his fatherly kindness, and that his promise may not be made
void.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We are the clay, and
thou our potter</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By means of a comparison they
magnify the grace of God, and acknowledge that they were formed of despicable
clay; for they do not seek the ground of superiority in themselves, but in their
origin celebrate the mercy of God, who out of mean and filthy clay determined to
create children to himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We
all are the work of thy hands</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Of the same
import as the former is this second clause, in which God is called the Creator,
and his people are called the work of his hands; because to God alone they
ascribe all that they are and all that they have. This is true gratitude; for,
so long as men advance the smallest claim to anything as their own, God is
defrauded of his right. Now, Isaiah speaks not of the ordinary creation of men,
but of regeneration, on account of which believers are especially called "the
work of God;" as we have frequently stated in the exposition of other passages: 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1035</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Here they acknowledge a remarkable act of God's kindness, in having elected them
to be his people, and adorned them with benefits so numerous and so
great.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be not angry, O Jehovah,
beyond measure.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1036</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The people pray that the severity of punishment and the fierceness of the wrath
of God may be abated; not that God goes beyond measure, but because they would
be altogether overwhelmed, if he should choose to act toward them with the
utmost strictness of justice. They therefore ask a mitigation of punishment; as
Jeremiah also says, "Chasten me, O Lord, but in judgment,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;241024&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
10:24,) that is, moderately; for he draws a contrast between "judgment" and
"wrath;" as it is elsewhere said that God chastises us "by the hand of man,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;100714&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 7:14,) because he does not put forth the power of his hand to punish us,
lest we should be utterly
destroyed.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Neither remember
iniquity for ever.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It deserves notice that they
do not absolutely shrink from the judgment of God, or pray that they may wholly
escape from it, but present themselves to be corrected, so as not to faint under
the strokes. And this is the reason why they desire to have the remembrance of
their iniquities blotted out; for, if God do not mercifully pardon them, there
will be no end of the
chastisements.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We all are thy
people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet repeats what he said a
little before, that God elected the family of Abraham; because the best ground
for the confident expectation of obtaining pardon was, that God, who is true to
his promises, cannot east away those whom he had once elected. By employing the
word all, he does not speak of each individual, as I formerly remarked, but
includes the whole body of the Church. Although the greater part had withdrawn
through wicked revolt, yet still it was true that the Jews were God's peculiar
people; and this prayer was offered, not for every one of them without
distinction, but only for the children of God who were still left. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1037</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The people do not plead their own merits before God, but betake themselves to
the covenant of free grace, by which they had been adopted. This is the sure and
only refuge of believers, this is the remedy for all evils; and that is the
reason why Moses and the other prophets repeat it so frequently.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;023213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
32:13.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The cities of thy
holiness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Church again recounts her
miseries, that she may move God to mercy and obtain pardon. She says that the
cities have been reduced to "a wilderness;" and, for the sake of amplification,
adds that "Zion is a desert;" because it was the royal residence, in which God
wished that men should call upon him. She adds also Jerusalem, in which Zion
was; for it appeared to be shameful that a city, which God had consecrated to
himself, should be ruined and destroyed by
enemies.</font><br><font face="Palatino">She calls them "cities of holiness,"
because, as the Lord had sanctified a people, so he also wished that the cities,
and even the whole country, should be consecrated to himself. Seeing, therefore,
that the cities were dedicated to God, they are justly called "cities of his
holiness;" for in them God reigned, and men called upon him. In the same manner
we may at the present day give the appellation of "cities of God's holiness" to
those which, laying aside superstitions, worship him in a sincere and right
manner.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The house of our sanctuary
and of our glory.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1038</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It is called "the sanctuary of the people" in a different sense from that in
which it is called "the sanctuary of God;" for, being the testimony of a sacred
union between God and the people, it is often called "God's holy house;" that
is, because it corresponds to his holiness. But now, in a passive sense,
believers call it "their sanctuary," because from it they must seek their
sanctification.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This is more plainly confirmed
by the words, "of our glory." They acknowledge that they have nothing in which
they ought to glory, except the temple, in which God wished to be adored and
worshipped. And yet we see that this glorying was often without foundation, and
for that reason was reproved by Jeremiah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Trust not in words of
falsehood, saying, The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, The temple of
the Lord, are we."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;240704&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
7:4.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But while the glorying of those who were proud and
insolent on account of empty titles was without foundation, yet true and
well-grounded was the glorying of those who embraced with the heart the Lord's
ordinance, and, relying on the testimony of his word, knew that they dwelt under
the shadow of him who had reared for himself a constant dwelling-place in the
midst of them; for the temple was built by the command of the Lord, so that the
Jews might justly glory in having God for the protector of their
salvation.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">In which our fathers
praised thee</font><font face="Palatino">. Because the worship of God was at
that time corrupted and adulterated, and almost all had revolted to superstition
and ungodliness, for this reason he mentions not the present but the former age.
As if he had said, "Though we have not rendered to thee such worship as we ought
to have rendered, yet this is the temple in which our fathers worshipped thee in
purity; wilt thou permit it to be profaned and destroyed? Will not this disgrace
recoil on thyself, since it relates to the worship of thy name?" Here the Jews
say nothing about their life, and bring forward no excuses, and rather confess
their guilt, but offer their worship to God, that he may be mindful of his
covenant, and not allow his promises to be made void. This example ought to be
imitated by all believers. The word "praise" denotes thanksgiving; as if he had
said, "In that temple, the melancholy ruins of which draw forth mourning and
tears from all believers, the praises of God at one time resounded, when he
treated his people with kindness and gentleness. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1039</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.

for these things, O Jehovah?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The people
strengthen themselves by assured confidence, that God will not permit his glory
to be trampled under foot, though men provoke him by innumerable transgressions.
This can yield no consolation of any kind to hypocrites, but relates solely to
those who are moved by a true sense of the mercy of God. Such persons believe
and are fully persuaded, though death threaten them, that God will nevertheless
have regard to his own glow, and will at least be gracious to the remnant, that
the seed may not perish.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
wilt thou afflict us beyond measure?</i></font><font face="Palatino">  
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1040</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

cannot deny himself."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;550213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 2:13.) But our salvation is connected with his glory. This ought to be
carefully observed; for, after having spoken of the glory of God, he adds, "Thou
wilt not afflict us beyond measure." The Lord will therefore restrain his
chastisements; for his glory, which he cannot disregard, is deeply involved in
our deliverance from death. To this prayer, therefore, let us betake ourselves
whenever we are attacked by our enemies; not in the manner of hypocrites, (who
haughtily boast of the glory of God, of which they have no experience whatever,)
but with repentance and faith, that we may actually obtain the fruit of that
glory.</font><br></div>

Prophet now passes on to another doctrine; for he shews that God has good reason
for rejecting and casting off the Jews. It is because they have profited nothing
by either warnings or threatenings to be brought back from their errors into the
right way. But that they might not think that the Lord's covenant would on that
account be made void, he adds that he will have another people which formerly
was no people, and that where he was formerly unknown, his name Shall be well
known and highly celebrated. The Jews looked on this as monstrous, and reckoned
it to be altogether inconsistent with the covenant which the Lord made with
Abraham,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011707&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
17:7,) if such a benefit were extended to any others than his posterity. But the
Prophet intended to strip them of the foolish confidence of imagining that God
was bound to the posterity of Abraham; for the Lord had not restricted himself
to them but on an absolute condition, and if this were violated by them, they
would be deprived, like covenant-breakers and traitors, of all the advantage
derived from the covenant. Nor was this promise made to Abraham alone, and to
those who were descended from him, but to all who should be ingrafted by faith
into his family. But it will be more convenient to begin with the second verse,
in which he explains the cause of the rejection, that we may more fully
understand the Prophet's design.

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have stretched out my

their ingratitude and rebellion; and in this manner he proves that there is no
reason why they should say that the Lord does them wrong if he bestow his grace
on others. The Jews conducted themselves proudly and insolently toward God, as
if they had been elected through their own merit. On account of their
ingratitude and insolence the Lord rejects them as unworthy, and complains that
to no purpose did he "stretch out his hands" to draw and bring them back to
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By "the stretching out of the hands" he
means the daily invitation. There are various ways in which the Lord "stretches
out his hands to us;" for he draws us to him, either effectually or by the word.
In this passage it must relate chiefly to the word. The Lord never speaks to us
without at the same time "stretching out his hand" to join us to himself, or
without causing us to feel, on the other hand, that he is near to us. He even
embraces us, and shews the anxiety of a father, so that, if we do not comply
with his invitation, it must be owing entirely to our own fault. The heinousness
of the guilt is greatly aggravated by long continuance, that, during a long
succession of ages, God did not cease to send one Prophet after another, and
even, as he says elsewhere, to rise early in the morning and continue the same
care till the evening.

"rebellious" or disobedient, but immediately afterwards he declares what is the

(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;610210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Peter 2:10;) that is, devoted to their own inclinations; for he commands us to
surrender our own judgment, that we may be capable of receiving the true
doctrine. The Lord therefore testifies that it was not owing to him that he did
not retain and continue to exercise towards them his wonted favor, but that they
alienated themselves through their own madness, because they chose to abide by
their own natural inclinations rather than to follow God as their
leader.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Having pointed out the cause of this
rejection, we must come to the calling of the Gentiles, who succeeded in the
room of the Jews; for that is undoubtedly the subject treated in the first
verse. The Lord had long ago foretold it by Moses, so that they ought not to
have thought that there was anything new in this
prediction.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"They have provoked me
by that which is not God; they have moved me to anger by their vanities; and I

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1042</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
When he says that God manifested himself "to them that asked not," he shews that
the Gentiles were anticipated by the grace of God, and that they brought no
merit or excellence as an inducement to God to give it to them. This obviously
agrees with that passage which we quoted, in which Moses calls them "a foolish
nation."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;053221&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
32:21.) Thus, under a universal type, he describes what is the nature of men
before the Lord anticipates them by his mercy; for they neither call on the
Lord, nor seek him, nor think about him. And this passage ought to be carefully
observed, in order to establish the certainty of our calling, which may be said
to be the key that opens to us the kingdom of heaven; for by means of it peace
and repose are given to our consciences, which would always be in doubt and
uncertainty if they did not rest on such testimonies. We see, therefore, that it
did not happen accidentally or suddenly that we were called by God and reckoned
to be his people; for it had been predicted long before in many passages. From
this passage Paul earnestly contends for the calling of the Gentiles, and says
that Isaiah boldly exclaims and affirms that the Gentiles have been called by
God, because he spoke more clearly and loudly than the circumstances of Ms own
time required. Here we see, therefore, that we were called by an eternal purpose
of God long before the event
happened.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold I, behold
I.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By repeating these words twice, he confirms
still more the declaration that God hath manifested himself in so friendly a
manner to foreign and heathen nations, that they do not doubt that he dwells in
the midst of them. And, indeed, that sudden change needed to be confirmed,
because it was difficult to be believed; although by that very novelty the
Prophet intended to magnify the unexpected grace of God. The meaning may be thus
summed up: "When the Lord shall have offered himself to the Gentiles, and they
shall have been joined to the holy family of Abraham, there will be some Church
in the world, after the Jews have been driven out." Now we see that all that is
here predicted by the Prophet was fulfilled by the Gospel, by which the Lord
actually offered and manifested himself to foreign nations. Whenever, therefore,
this voice of the Gospel is sounded in our ears, or when we record the word of
the Lord, let us know that the Lord is present, and offers himself, that we may
know him familiarly, and may call on him boldly and with assured
confidence.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A people that provoketh
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he describes and illustrates more
largely in what respects the Jews were rebellious against God. It was because
they had forsaken the command of God, and had polluted themselves by various
superstitions. He had said a little before,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;236317&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
63:17,) that the Jews had estranged themselves from God, because they wandered
after their inventions; and now he points out the fruit of that licentiousness,
that, by giving a loose rein to their thoughts, they overturned the pure worship
of God. And undoubtedly this is the origin of all superstitions, that men are
delighted with their own inventions, and choose to be wise in their own eyes
rather than restrain their senses in obedience to God. In vain do men bring
forward their devotions, as they call them, and their good intentions, which God
holds in such abhorrence and detestation that they who have followed them are
guilty of breaking the covenant and deserting from their allegiance; for there
is nothing which we ought to undertake of our own accord, but we ought to obey
God when he commands. In a word, the beginning and perfection of lawful worship
is a readiness to obey.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By the word "provoke" he
describes the impudence of the people, who deliberately, as it were, provoked
God, and had no reverence for his majesty so as to submit to his authority. And
he heightens the description by
saying</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, To my
face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for since God may be said to be
present and actually beheld by those whom he warns by his word, they sin more
heinously, and are guilty of greater impudence and rebellion, than those who
never heard the word.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That
sacrificeth in gardens, and offereth incense on
bricks.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He mentions the "gardens" which they
had consecrated to their idols, and says that they provoked him by them. Some
think that "bricks" are mentioned by way of contempt, and are indirectly
contrasted with the altar on which alone God wished that they should sacrifice;
and accordingly they think that here he mentions the roofs on which
superstitious persons were wont to offer sacrifices; for they were made of
"bricks." But I think that it means simply the altars which they had built for
idols; for, although they were not without the plausible pretense of wishing to
imitate that form of altar which God had prescribed, yet God abhorred it,
because it was contrary to his word.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who dwell in the
graves.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He enumerates other kinds of
superstitions; and although, in consequence of its brevity, the description is
obscure, yet we may easily learn from other passages what was the nature of
them. For as necromancy was generally practiced among heathen nations, the Jews
also consulted demons "in graves and deserts," instead of consulting God alone,
which they ought to have done; and, as if they were seeking answers from the
dead, they took pleasure in being deceived by the illusions of demons.

How solemnly the Lord had forbidden it, appears very clearly from
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051810&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
18:10, 11, and other passages; and we have seen something of this kind in a
former part of this book,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230819&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
8:19.) In general we are taught that God demands nothing more than obedience,
which he prefers to slain beasts and sacrifices.

Samuel 15:22.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who eat swine's
flesh.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Formerly he complained that the worship
of God was polluted by strange inventions; and now he adds that they set aside
every distinction, so that they do not distinguish between the clean and the
unclean; and he brings forward a single instance, that they do not abstain from
"swine's flesh." But it may be thought that this was a small matter. Very far
from it; for we ought not to judge from our own opinion, but from that of the
legislator, how heinous a sin it is; and nothing which the Lord has forbidden
ought to be reckoned trivial.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;031107&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
11:7;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;051408&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
14:8.) This related to the external profession of. faith, by which the Jews were
in duty bound to testify how widely they differed from the pollution of the
Gentiles. From that rule, therefore, which the Lord enjoins upon us, we must not
swerve even a hair's breadth.

He points out extreme impiety in the Jews, who obstinately and rebelliously
opposed God's worshippers, and refused to listen to any warnings. There is some
hope of repentance, so long as we lend an ear to warnings and reproofs; but if
we reject them, our case is undoubtedly
hopeless.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Though the words are apparently
obscure, their meaning amounts to this, that hypocrites disdainfully and
fiercely repel faithful advisers, because they either make false claims to
holiness, or, on account of pride, do not suffer themselves to be reproved; for
hypocrisy is never free from supercilious disdain and haughtiness. Let us not
wonder, therefore, that those who are infected by this vice swell with insolent
pretensions, and boast of their virtue and holiness, and value themselves more
highly than all others; for Satan has blinded them to make an idle and
ostentatious boast of what they call their devotions, and to despise the word of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Commentators think that this is a general
statement; which reproves the Jews for refusing to submit to the prophets. But
it appears to me that we ought to take into account a circumstance to which they
do not attach sufficient weight, that this verse is in close and immediate
connection with the preceding verses, and contains a sharp reproof of the Jews,
for not only revolting from the true worship, but likewise following obstinately
their own inventions, so as to turn with disdain from every one that did not
flatter them; for that phrase, "Remain with thyself," means nothing else than
"Away with thee!" as if they declared that they would have nothing to do with
honest instructors. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1046</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lo, it is written before
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He alludes to the ordinary custom of
judges, who keep before them in writing the processes of investigation regarding
any matter, together with the testimonies, acts, and everything of that nature,
in order that, when it shall be found necessary to make use of them, the guilt
of the culprit may be easily proved; for we write those things which we wish to
be remembered by posterity The Lord therefore testifies that these things can
never fade into oblivion, because they have been written; for, although for a
time he pass them over in silence, yet the wicked shall not escape unpunished,
but shall at length feel that he is a righteous
judge.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we ought to learn that we must not
abuse God's patience, because he bears with us long, and does not all at once
stretch out his hand to punish us; for all our faults are nevertheless written
before him, for which we must at length suffer punishment, if we do not repent. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1047</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
True, indeed, the Lord has no need of writing as an aid to memory; but he makes
use of this form of expression, that we may not think that he has forgotten
anything, when he is slow in executing his judgments. Jeremiah even says
expressly, that</font><br></div>

Scripture; for men think either that their sins are concealed, or that they will
not be called to account for them; but, hurried along by unbridled lust, or
laying the blame on some other person, they drive fear to a distance from them.

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Your iniquities and the

enlarges on that, which he had expressed briefly in the preceding verse; for he
shews that the Jews are not now, for the first time, guilty of this treason, but
that there is the ancient example of the fathers, in whose footsteps they
closely follow. In like manner the Lord formerly complained that he had borne
long with that people, and was at length wearied with them. He therefore
describes the aggravated heinousness of the offense, by saying that the Jews
follow the example of their fathers; as if he had said, "They are very bad eggs
of bad crows;" for the more frequently and the more earnestly that men have been
warned, so much the more must they be condemned for obstinacy, if they do not
repent. Thus he shews that they disregarded warnings and threatenings, and
persevered for many years in their baseness and impiety; that they may no longer
bring forward any excuse or pretense, but, on the contrary, may know that they
deserve severe punishment.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here we see that the
corruption which has flowed from the fathers is so far from being an excuse to
the children, (as is alleged by ignorant persons, who commonly make use of this

glances at one kind of sin, under which, by a figure of speech in which a part

by it the whole of the revolt by which the people withdrew from the true
worship, and devoted and gave themselves up to strange gods. This is the utmost
verge of iniquities; for, when the fear of God has been taken away, we can have
nothing sound or healthy in us. Thus he points out the source of all evils,
which ought to be the more diligently observed, because men are highly pleased
with themselves, and think that they deserve great praise, when they worship God
according to their own fancy, and do not understand that nothing is more
abominable in the sight of God than pretended worship, which proceeds from human
contrivance. Beyond all doubt, the people desired to be acceptable to God by
"offering incense on the mountains;" but it is not from the purpose of their
mind, and from their intention, as they call it, that we must judge of their
work. In preference to all men, we must listen to the voice of the Lord, who
testifies that he is greatly dishonored, that we may not endeavor to defend

beginning." But we must take into account the connection of the passage, from
which the Prophet's meaning will be clearly seen. Having spoken a little before
about the works of the fathers, he undoubtedly ridicules those who made them a
bulwark. It is a slight and useless defense, and indeed it is idle to plead
before God the practices of the fathers, that is, their long-continued
corruption; for in this way we bring down on ourselves a heavier judgment. And
yet many men are so intoxicated by this pretense, that they think that no
objection can be brought against it, and even refuse to listen to anything else.
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1048</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Antiquity, indeed, is highly venerable; but no man ought to value it so highly
as to make the smallest diminution of the honor of God. This is a remarkable
passage for convincing those who uphold superstitions by length of years, as if
old established error ought to be accounted a
law.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here the Prophet softens the preceding
statement; for otherwise it would have been very hard to say that the iniquities
of the fathers would be brought to remembrance in such a manner, that the Lord
would destroy the fathers and the children along with them; and these things
might strike believers with such horror as to lead them to think that their
salvation was past all hope. We must therefore be carefully on our guard, and
observe the reason why the Lord is angry with us; for he wishes to terrify us,
so as to lead us to himself, and not so as to throw us into despair. For this
reason he holds out hope to believers, that they may not lose courage; and, by
exhibiting consolation, he encourages them to repentance. He confirms it by a
comparison.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As if one found a
grape in a cluster.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As if a person who has
determined to root out a vine that is inconvenient or injurious to him, and
finds a fruit-bearing branch, shall spare it; so the Lord will refrain from
tearing up those in which he shall find no strength or flavor. Formerly he
complained that the people were useless, and even that they yielded bitter
fruits.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230502&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
5:2, 4, 7.) Isaiah retains the same comparison, but applies it in a different
manner. "Though the people may be said to be an unfruitful and degenerate vine,
yet there are still left some fruit-bearing branches which the Lord will not
suffer to perish.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But this may be understood in
two ways; either that the Lord will preserve his people for the sake of the
elect, or that, when the reprobate are destroyed, he will rescue believers from
destruction. There is a wide difference between these two interpretations. As to
the first, we know that the wicked are sometimes spared on account of good men,
whom God does not wish to destroy or to involve in the same judgment, as various
examples of Scripture sufficiently shew. The Lord would have spared Sodom, if he
had found but ten good men in it.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011832&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
18:32.) All who sailed along with Paul, to the number of "two hundred and
seventy-six,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;442737&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
27:37,) were "given to him" and rescued from shipwreck, that the power which He
manifested in his servant might be more illustriously displayed.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;442724&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
27:24.) The Lord blessed the house of Potiphar, and made it to prosper in all
things, for the sake of Joseph who was in his family.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;013905&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
39:5.) There are other examples of the same kind, which every one will easily
collect for himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But I approve more highly
of the other interpretation, that the Lord will punish the sins of his people in
such a manner as to have regard nevertheless to his own, and not to involve all
universally in the same destruction. Nor does he mean only that believers shall
be saved, but that a people shall be left amongst whom men shall call on his
name. And the comparison ought to be carefully observed; for he shews that the
remnant will be small, as compared with the multitude which was at that time, as
has been already explained.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:9.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Now, as to believers being often punished
along with the reprobate, let us not think that it is wrong; for the Lord will
often find in each of us enough of blame to afflict and punish us. Besides, he
wishes to instruct and arouse us by his chastisements; and seeing that we have
been joined to a certain people, and, as it were, ingrafted into their body, we
undoubtedly ought not to think it strange if we, who may be said to be diseased
members, shall share in the same strokes and pains. Yet the Lord moderates the
punishment, so as not to tear up by the roots the elect
plants.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will bring forth a seed
out of Jacob.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He explains the preceding verse
by other words, and shews that the Lord wishes to reserve for himself some
"seed" that shall call upon him; for the Lord is wont to chastise his people in
such a manner as to determine that the Church shall exist, in which his truth
and the pure religion may be preserved, and which Paul for that very reason
calls "the pillar and foundation of truth."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;540315&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 3:15.) We must not, therefore, judge of the Church from the present
condition of things, (for nothing in this world can be permanent,) but from the
purpose of God, which will not suffer it to be overturned or destroyed. This
ought to be carefully remembered by us, that we may not be terrified by any
calamities or ruins, or by any hideous desolation of the
Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And out of Judah the
heir of my mountains.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He gives the appellation
of "heirs of the mountains" to those who, having returned from captivity, shall
again inhabit their native land. Judea, as is well known, was a mountainous
country. He again explains what might have appeared to be somewhat
obscure.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And my elect shall
possess it by inheritance.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He means that the
Jews shall return to their original condition, that they may enjoy that country
as their own inheritance, from which they had been driven out. Judea was soon
afterwards reduced to the utmost desolation. The Lord testifies that this shall
not be of long duration; and, in order to confirm it the more, he mentions in a
compendious manner the covenant by which that land was destined for them, that
they might possess it by the right of inheritance. Thus, although they were long
in captivity, yet this word "inheritance" ought to arouse them to cherish the
confident hope that they would at length regain the possession of it. But it
ought to be observed that this grace is confined to the elect and true
worshippers of God, that every one may not apply it to himself without
distinction.

else than that the land, which was a desert, shall be again inhabited; for there
is an implied comparison. "Although, in consequence of the banishment of her
inhabitants into a distant country, she shall be forsaken and desolate, yet she
shall at length be inhabited, so as to abound in flocks and herds, and have
lands that are fertile and that are fit for pasture, and supply abundantly
everything that is necessary for the food and support of men." Sharon was a
place adapted to pasture, and so was Achor; but the former was adapted to
flocks, and the latter to herds.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Here we see
that the promises of God contain blessings not only of the future but also of

we are invited to the greater and more excellent blessings of the heavenly life.
When the Lord extends his bounty to flocks and herds, this ought to confirm us
the more and make us more certain of his fatherly care and anxiety about us; for
if he pays attention to flocks which were created for our sake, much more will
he supply us with all that is necessary</font><br></div>

who were not ashamed of glorying vainly and falsely of the name of God. Although
they confidently boast of promises and sacraments, yet they have nothing in
common with the children, and, having been shut out from all hope of God's
favors, they receive the reward of their iniquity. By adding, Who have sought
me, he describes more plainly who are they that shall be partakers of these
benefits, in order that, as has been already said, he may entirely cut off
reprobates and hypocrites. The sure mark by which lambs are distinguished from
kids, and lawful children from bastards, is to "seek" the Lord; for it is not
enough to shelter ourselves under a name and title, but we must seek the Lord
with a pure conscience, that we may cleave to him with the whole heart.

hypocrites may not abuse these promises, or think that what is said about the

words, and calls them "forsakers," 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1051</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because they "have forgotten" Mount Zion; that is, have revolted from the true
worship of God. By "the mountain of holiness" he denotes figuratively the rule
of a holy life which had been laid down in the word of the Lord; for the temple
had been built by the command of the Lord, that these men might call upon him;
and likewise the altar on which the Lord wished that sacrifices should be
offered. Thus those sacrifices and oblations were impure which were offered in
other places, or to other gods, or in any way different from the strict
observance of the ceremonies of the Law. It is not lawful for men to undertake
anything at their own suggestion; for the Lord demands nothing but obedience,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;091522&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1052</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He enumerates their superstitions. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dg</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>Gad</i>) is variously explained. Some think that it denotes Jupiter, or the
star of Jupiter; and others that it denotes Fortune. Jerome translates the
words, "Ye who spread a table for fortune;" for he thinks that it means
prosperity. But I think it more probable that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dg</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>Gad</i>) means "a band," or "a troop," or even "an army;" and this agrees
well with the etymology of the word and the context. One passage is especially
worthy of notice,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;013011&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
30:11,) in which Leah rejoices on account of the addition of children; for I
think that the word which he employs,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dgb</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>begad</i>), ought to be understood as if she had said, "Now, I have plenty
of children;" for she had many children before that time, and hence she gave the
name
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dg</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>Gad</i>) to her fifth son. Accordingly, I think that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dg</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>Gad</i>) ought to be interpreted, in this passage, as meaning "a troop," or
"an army;" because their false gods were so numerous, that they could scarcely
be numbered for multitude.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
fill an oblation to the number.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To fill may
here be taken in two senses; either that they supplied everything largely and
bountifully for the worship of idols; (for superstition has no limit or measure,
and they who are niggardly in the worship of God very cheerfully spend all that
they have for the sake of idols;) or that they passed by no idol to which they
did not render their worship. I prefer the latter meaning; for idolaters do not
think that they have done enough, if they do not give honor to each of the
saints; and the more numerous the saints whom they have honored, they think that
they will have better success. We have too great experience of this every day in
the Papists.</font><br><font face="Palatino">By "number" he means the same thing
as he formerly meant by "army;" for it is a repetition which is very customary
among Hebrew writers. He means, therefore, that "a table is prepared," that is,
sacrifice is offered, not to a single idol, but to a great number of idols; in
order to shew clearly how grievous are the punishments which they have
deserved.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore I will number you
to the sword.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He alludes to the number of the
gods; and the Lord declares that he will easily ascertain how numerous they are,
for he "will number them to the sword." And hence we see that the Prophet, in
the preceding verse, does not speak of the two planets, Jupiter and Mercury, as
some think, but means that they were not satisfied with one God, and collected
for themselves various idols. It is an idle conjecture that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ynm</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>meni</i>) denotes Mercury, because
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnm</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>manah</i>) signifies "to number," and Mercury presided over numbers and
merchants. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1053</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The design of the Prophet is manifest, who declares that the people "shall be
numbered to the sword," because they delighted in a vast number of gods, and did
not choose to rely on one
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because I called, and ye
did not answer.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He heightens the extent and
heinousness of that treason, by saying that the Jews sinned through deliberate
malice, and on purpose, rather than through ignorance. They had been often
instructed and warned, but had disdainfully rejected all warnings, and
consequently were far less excusable than others, to whom no prophets were sent;
for although ignorance cannot be pleaded as an excuse by any man, yet much less
can it be pleaded by the Jews and those to whom the word of God is proclaimed,
and who, on that account, will be condemned and punished more severely than
others.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I spake, and ye did
not hear.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He describes the manner of calling,
namely, that he exhorted the people by the prophets; for by the word "speak" he
twice repeats the same thing, as we have already stated to be the custom of
Hebrew writers. To "hear" the Lord is to obey his word; for it would be a
trivial matter to lend our ears, if we did not submit to the word; and it would
then be with us as the proverb says, "They listen with the ears of an ass." 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1054</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
God wishes to be heard sincerely, and does not approve of a pretended hearing;
and he shews how it came that they rejected the calling. It was because they
shut their ears to the doctrine of the prophets; for the beginning of obedience
is to bring a desire to
learn.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And ye did evil before
mine eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The phrase, "before mine eyes," is
of the same import as "to my face;" a mode of expression which he made use of a
little before. (Verse 3.) All men, indeed, sin "before the eyes" of the Lord,
and none can withdraw from his presence. But in a peculiar sense we are said to
sin "before his eyes," when, having been called by him, we do not dread his
presence; for he approaches nearer to those whom he calls by the prophets, and,
so to speak, exhibits himself as present to them. Far more detestable,
therefore, and worthy of severe chastisements, is the impiety of those who,
laying aside all shame, despise and scorn God when he draws near to call and
invite them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And chose the
things in which I took no pleasure.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> From this
concluding clause of the verse it is evident that they are condemned, not for
gross crimes, but for foolish devotions, by which they corrupted the worship of
God. Although they zealously devoted themselves to sacrifices contrived by
themselves, because they thought that in this way they would become entitled to
the favor of God; yet he declares that he abhors their wicked practices. It is
not permitted that any person shall have a free choice to follow whatever he
thinks fit, but all must observe what God approves, and must not turn aside from
it in any way whatever. Now we see that it was not a fault peculiar to a single
age that men should follow their own caprice in the worship of God, and should
adore their own inventions instead of God; but whatever "pleasure" men "take in
these things," the Lord solemnly declares that he condemns and abhors
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13. </b>and <b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, my servants shall
eat.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here also the Prophet more deafly
distinguishes between hypocrites, who held a place in the Church, and the true
and lawful children; for, although all without distinction were called children,
yet he skews that many shall be disowned as not belonging to the family, and
that they who proudly and haughtily exalted themselves, under the name of the
people of God, shall be disappointed of their hope, which is vain and false. We
must carefully observe the highly emphatic contrast between "the servants of
God," and those who falsely pretend to his name; for he shews that empty titles,
and false boasting, or vain confidence, shall avail them
nothing.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall eat, shall
drink.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By these words he denotes happiness and
a prosperous condition of life; as if he had said, that he will take care that
believers shall not be in want of anything. But the Lord promises to his
servants something different from what he actually bestows; for they often "are
hungry and thirsty,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 4:11,) while the wicked abound in enjoyments of every kind, and
abuse them for luxury and intemperance. But it ought to be observed, that the
kingdom of Christ is here described under figures; for otherwise we could not
understand it. Accordingly, the Prophet draws comparisons from earthly kingdoms,
in which, when the people abound in wealth and enjoy comforts of every kind,
there is a visible display of the blessing of God from which we may judge of his
fatherly love.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But since it is not proper that
good men should have their minds engrossed by earthly advantages, it is enough
that some taste of those advantages should support their faith. And if they are
sometimes oppressed by hunger, yet, being satisfied with a moderate portion of
good, they nevertheless acknowledge that God is their Father, and that he is
kind to them, and in their poverty have greater riches than kings and nobles. On
the other hand, the wicked, whatever may be their abundance of good things,
cannot enjoy them with a good conscience, and therefore are the most wretched of
all men. The Prophet, therefore, has in his eye the right use of the gifts of
God; for they who serve God in a right manner receive, as children from the hand
of a father, all that is necessary for this life, while others, like thieves and
profane persons, take violent possession of it. Wicked men are never satisfied
with any amount of wealth, however great; they have continual fear and
trembling, and their conscience can never be at
ease.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The Lord, therefore, does not promise here
what he does not actually bestow; and this happiness must not be estimated by
the outward condition of things. This is still more evident from what follows,
where he speaks of joy and thanksgiving. The Prophet undoubtedly intends to
state in a few words, that contentment does not lie in abundance of earthly
enjoyments, but in calm peace of mind and spiritual joy; for unbelievers have no
relish for such things, but to believers a persuasion of God's fatherly love is
more delightful than all earthly enjoyments. Yet let us observe that we ought to
look for all prosperity from God alone, who will not permit his people to be in
want of anything that belongs to a happy
life.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.

</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1055</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
to my elect.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He continues the same doctrine,
and teaches that God will at length separate hypocrites from the true servants.
And indeed we need not wonder that the Prophet dwells so much on this point; for
there is nothing of which it is harder to convince hypocrites, who, puffed up
with pride, deceive and blind themselves. He affirms that "their name" shall be
"accursed," because they thought that they were the holy seed, and that nothing
else under heaven was worthy of being remembered. Such is also the import of the
word "Leave;" as if he had said that false boasting, to which they were so
strongly attached, shall be shaken off by violence; and therefore, that they may
not flatter themselves with a glory that is temporal, and that shall speedily
pass away, the Lord rebukes that haughtiness, and declares that he will have
other servants, to whom they shall be a curse, so that even in solemn cursing
this shall be taken as an example, "May God curse thee as he has cursed the
Jews!"</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And shall call his
servants by another name.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He shews how
ill-founded is the confidence of that nation, which thought that God would have
no people, if he had not the posterity of Abraham; for he solemnly declares that
he will adopt a new people, and that he is not confined to the Jews, so as not
easily to find others whom he shall adorn with the "name" of his people. The
opinion entertained by some, that by "another name" is meant the Christian name,
is exceedingly unnatural; and even from the context it is evident that the
Prophet had quite a different object in view; for, in consequence of the Jews
boasting proudly of the antiquity of their name, and growing insolent at having
been elected by God long ago, as if God could not do without them, he shews that
he will elect and adopt another people, and yet that he cannot be accused of
capriciousness or fickleness, as if he had changed his mind. He will execute his
purpose and his righteous judgments against those who, under a false pretense of
his name, obscure his glory and corrupt all
godliness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.

with a corner of Judea, in which the worship of God might be said to be shut up.
Since the time when God has been manifested everywhere, he is not now worshipped
in one particular district, but in all places without distinction; as Christ
also teacheth,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430421&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John

<div><font face="Palatino">Thus the word "earth," by which he denotes, in this

Judea.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall bless himself in
the true God. Shall swear by the true God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By
"blessing" and "swearing" he denotes the whole of the worship of God.
"Swearing," as we have formerly seen, 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1056</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is a kind of worship of God; for by it we declare that all judgment belongs to
God, and acknowledge that he is perfectly acquainted with all that we do. We
"bless," when we wish to obtain from him all prosperity, and render thanksgiving
to him alone; and, in short, when we acknowledge that our prosperity comes from
no other source than from his undeserved kindness. By "the true God" is meant
that he is faithful to his promises and steadfast to his purpose; though perhaps
there is an implied and indirect contrast between "the true God" and the false
gods of the Gentiles.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the
former afflictions are surrendered to
forgetfulness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This promise relates to
believers only. God declares that he will put an end to their afflictions and
distresses, that the calamity of the Church may not be perpetual. This began to
be accomplished when the people were brought out of Babylon; for, although they
were afflicted in various ways both during the journey and at home, yet the
severity of the punishments was mitigated; because the return to their native
country, the rebuilding of the temple, the restoration of regular government,
soothed their griefs, and supported their hearts by good hope till the coming of
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For, lo, I will create new
heavens and a new earth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By these metaphors he
promises a remarkable change of affairs; as if God had said that he has both the
inclination and the power not only to restore his Church, but to restore it in
such a manner that it shall appear to gain new life and to dwell in a new world.
These are exaggerated modes of expression; but the greatness of such a blessing,
which was to be manifested at the coming of Christ, could not be described in
any other way. Nor does he mean only the first coming, but the whole reign,
which must be extended as far as to the last coming, as we have already said in
expounding other passages.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Thus the world is (so
to speak) renewed by Christ; and hence also the Apostle
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580205&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
2:5) calls it "a new age," and undoubtedly alludes to this statement of the
Prophet. Yet the Prophet speaks of the restoration of the Church after the
return from Babylon. This is undoubtedly true; but that restoration is
imperfect, if it be not extended as far as to Christ; and even now we are in the
progress and accomplishment of it, and those things will not be fulfilled till
the last resurrection, which has been prescribed to be our
limit.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The former things shall
not be remembered.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some refer these words to
heaven and earth; as if he had said that henceforth they shall have no celebrity
and no name. But I choose rather to refer them to the former times; for he means
that the joy at being restored shall be so great that they shall no longer
remember their miseries. Or perhaps it will be thought preferable to view them
as relating to benefits which, though they were worthy of being recorded, lost
their name when God's amazing- grace shone forth. In this sense the Prophet said
elsewhere, "Remember ye not the former things."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234318&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
43:18.) Not that God wished the first deliverance to be set aside or blotted out
of the hearts of believers; but because by comparison the one brought a kind of
forgetfulness over the other, just as the sun, when he rises, deprives the stars
of their brightness.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Let us remember that these
things take place in us so far as we are renewed. But we are only in part
renewed, and therefore we do not yet see a new heaven and a new earth. We need
not wonder, therefore, that we continue to mourn and weep, since we have not
entirely laid aside the old man, but many remains are still left. It is with us
also that the renovation ought to begin; because we hold the first rank, and it
is through our sin that "the creatures groan, and are subject to vanity," as
Paul shews.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450820&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:20.) But when we shall be perfectly renewed, heaven and earth shall also be
fully renewed, and shall regain their former state. And hence it ought to be
inferred, as we have frequently remarked, that the Prophet has in his eye the
whole reign of Christ, down to its final close, which is also
called</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"the day of renovation
and restoration."

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18. </b>But rejoice ye and be glad for ever. He
exhorts believers to rejoice, in such a manner as they ought, on account of such
a benefit bestowed by God. And this was added for the sake of amplification;
because men do not adequately consider God's other benefits, and especially that
which is the highest and most excellent of all; for either they disregard them
altogether, or value them less than they ought to do. On this account believers
must be aroused and urged by such exhortations as these, that they may not chew
themselves to be unthankful or unmindful, or think that it ought to be lightly
passed by, that, having been redeemed by the hand of Christ, they carry in their
hearts the pledge of eternal and heavenly life. That is the reason why Isaiah
chews that believers do not give due praise for redemption in any other way than
by continuing their joy through the whole course of their life, and employing
themselves in celebrating the praises of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For, lo, I create
Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> At
first sight this might be thought harsh; but an excellent meaning is obtained,
that the ground of joy in the deliverance of the Church shall be so great as to
remove every cloud of sadness. And, indeed, since even afflictions aid our
salvation,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450828&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:28,) we have good reason for rejoicing in
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will be glad in
Jerusalem.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He expresses more than in the
preceding verse; for by these words he means that he not only will give to men
ground for rejoicing, but even will be a partaker with them in that joy. So
great is his love toward us, that he delights in our prosperity not less than if
he enjoyed it along with us. And hence we obtain no small confirmation of our
faith, when we learn that God is moved, and so powerfully moved, by such an
affection toward us. If we are in painful and distressed circumstances, he says
that he is affected by grief and sorrow; and, on the other hand, if our
condition is pleasant and comfortable, he says that he takes great pleasure in
our prosperity. Hence also we have formerly seen that "the Spirit of the Lord is
sad and vexed,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;236310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
63:10,) when that order which he demands and approves is overturned and
confounded; and in another passage he takes upon himself the character of a
husband who is satisfied with the love of his wife.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;236205&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
62:5.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There shall be no more thence
an infant of days.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some think that this points
out the difference between the Law and the Gospel; because "the Law, as a
schoolmaster,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;480324&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:24,) kept scholars in the first elements, but the Gospel leads us on to mature
age. Others suppose it to mean that there will no longer be any distinction of
age; because, where life is eternal, no line is drawn between the child and the
old man. But I interpret the words of the Prophet in this manner, "Whether they
are children or old men, they shall arrive at mature age so as to be always
vigorous, like persons in the prime of life; and, in short, they shall always be
healthful and robust;" for it is on account of our sins that we grow old and
lose our strength. "All our days," saith Moses, "pass away when thou art angry:
we close our years quicker than a word. The days of our years in which we live
are seventy years, or, at the utmost, eighty: what goeth beyond this in the
strongest is toil and vexation; our strength passeth swiftly, and we fly away."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;199009&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
90:9, 10.) But Christ comes to repair our strength, and to restore and preserve
our original condition.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For
the son of a hundred years shall die young.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It
is proper to distinguish between the two clauses; for, after having said that
the citizens of the Church shall be long-lived, so that no one shall be taken
out of the world till he has reached mature age and fully completed his course,
he likewise adds that, even in old age, they shall be robust. Although the
greater part of believers hardly support themselves through weakness, and the
strength of others decays even before the time, yet that promise is not made
void; for, if Christ reigned truly and perfectly in us, his strength would
undoubtedly flourish in us, and would invigorate both body and soul. To our
sins, therefore, it ought to be imputed, that we are liable to diseases, pains,
old age, and other inconveniences; for we do not permit Christ to possess us
fully, and have not advanced so far in newness of life as to lay aside all that
is old. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1057</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino">Here
it ought also to be observed, that blessings either of soul or body are found
only in the kingdom of Christ, that is, in the Church, apart from which there is
nothing but cursing. Hence it follows that all who have no share in that kingdom
are wretched and unhappy; and, however fresh and vigorous they may appear to be,
they are, nevertheless, in the sight of God, rotten and stinking
corpses.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21 </b>and <b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall build houses and
inhabit them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In these verses he mentions what
is written in the Law; for these are the blessings of the Law, that they who
have obeyed God shall dwell in the houses which they have built, and shall
gather fruit from the trees which they have planted.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;032610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
26:10.) On the other hand, the disobedient shall be expelled from the houses
which they built, and shall give place to foreigners, and shall be deprived of
the fruits of the trees which they planted. "The Lord," saith Isaiah, "shall
protect you from that curse, so as to enjoy your property." Now the Prophets
hold out those things which relate to the present life, and borrow metaphors
from them; but it is in order that they may teach us to rise higher and to
embrace eternal and blessed life. We must not fix our whole attention on these
transitory blessings, but must make use of them as ladders, that, being raised
to heaven, we may enjoy eternal and immortal blessings. To the Church, which has
been renewed, and which rests on nothing but God's good pleasure and undeserved
favor, is justly promised the enjoyment of those blessings of which unbelievers
had deprived
themselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to the
days of a tree.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some think that this is a
promise of eternal life; as if men had the tree of life; but that is forged
ingenuity, and far removed from the Prophet's meaning. And I do wonder that
commentators give themselves so much trouble in explaining this passage; for the
Prophet speaks, not only of life, but of a peaceful condition of life; as if he
had said, "Ye shall plant vineyards, and shall eat the fruit of them; and ye
shall not be removed from this life before receiving the fruit, which shall be
enjoyed, not only by yourselves, but by your children and posterity. He employs
the metaphor of a tree, because he had formerly spoken of planting vineyards;
and accordingly he promises that the people shall peacefully enjoy both their
houses and their vineyards, and shall not be molested by enemies or robbers, and
this peaceful condition shall last as long as the life of a
tree.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And my elect shall
perpetually enjoy</i></font><font face="Palatino">   
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1058</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
the work of their hands.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> A work is said to be
continued or perpetuated when the result of it is prosperous; for otherwise men
would subject themselves to long and severe toil, and all to no purpose, if God
did not grant success. Enemies will either take away or destroy what we have
begun, and the completion of it will be out of our power; and therefore it is
strictly said to be continued, not when merely some progress is made, but when
it is brought to a close. Here it ought to be observed, that we cannot possess
our wealth and have the peaceful and lawful enjoyment of it in any other way
than by dwelling in the kingdom of Christ, who is the only heir of the world,
and without being ingrafted into his body. Wicked men may indeed enjoy, for many
years, the good things of this life; but they will continually be uneasy, and
will wretchedly devour themselves, so that even possession shall be destructive
and deadly; for it is only by faith that we obtain all that belongs to a blessed
life, and they who have not faith cannot be members of
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall not toil in
vain.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He enumerates other kinds of blessings
which God promises to the kingdom of Christ; for, although God always blessed
his people, yet the blessings were in some measure suspended till the coming of
Christ, in whom was displayed full and complete happiness. In a word, both Jews
and Gentiles shall be happy, in all respects, under the reign of Christ. Now, as
it is a token of God's wrath and curse when we obtain no advantage front our
labor, so, on the other hand, it is a token of blessing when we clearly see the
fruit of our labor. For this reason he says that they who shall have returned
from captivity, in order that they may obtain a true and complete deliverance,
shall not spend their labor in vain or lose their pains. The Law threatens the
death of relatives, destructive wars, losses of property, and terror in their
hearts.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;032622&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
26:22;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;052848&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
28:48.) Here, on the contrary, are promised fertility, peace, the fruit of
labor, and repose. And blessings of this kind ought to be carefully observed;
for there are few who, amidst their labors, think of the blessing of God, so as
to ascribe everything to him alone, and to be fully convinced that they will
accomplish nothing whatever unless the Lord grant to them a prosperous result.
Wherefore, as every blessing should be sought from God, so, when it has been
received, thanksgiving should be rendered for it to God
alone.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall not
bring forth in terror.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When it is said that
women "shall not bring forth in terror," some explain it to mean, that they
shall have no uneasiness or dread of childbirth, because they shall be free from
pain. We know that this punishment was inflicted on the woman on account of sin,
to bring forth with difficulty, and to be in danger of death. Children are
brought into the world with fear and trembling, when there is any expectation of
war; and it is probable that the Prophet rather looks to this, that there shall
be such settled peace that neither women nor men shall have any reason to fear;
for this must be viewed as relating to both parents, who will have no dread
about their children, as commonly happens when any danger is
threatened.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For they shall be
the seed of the blessed of Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This reason
is highly appropriate; for whence come fears and terrors, whence come alarms,
but from the curse of God? When the curse has been removed, the Prophet
therefore says justly that parents, together with their offspring, shall be free
from dread and anxious solicitude; because they shall be convinced that they
shall always be safe and sound through the favor of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And their offspring with
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is contrasted with childlessness,
which is reckoned in the number of the curses of God; and therefore it is the
same as if he had said, "I will no longer deprive them of their children, but
will cause them to enjoy them, along with the rest of the blessings which I
shall bestow upon them."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Before they cry, I will
listen.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> A remarkable promise; for nothing is
more desirable than to have God reconciled to us, and to have it in our power to
draw near to him with freedom and boldness; for, although we are surrounded by
innumerable distresses and calamities, yet we cannot be miserable so long as we
are at liberty to betake ourselves to the Lord. Here therefore the Lord promises
that we shall not pray in vain. Yet this was also promised to the fathers under
the Law. It is certain that, since the beginning of the world, God listened to
the fathers, to all that called upon him; for this is the most valuable fruit of
faith. But he confirms this more and more. Because the Jews would be exiles for
a long time, the Lord solemnly declares that he will not permit them any longer
to languish in banishment, and will no longer delay his assistance, but will
"listen to them even before they cry."</font><br><font face="Palatino">This
relates chiefly to the kingdom of Christ, through whom we are heard and have
access to God the Father, as Paul admirably explains.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:18; 3:12.) The fathers indeed enjoyed the same access, and there was no other
way in which they could be heard but through Christ; but the door was still
narrow and might be said to be shut, whereas now it has been most widely and
perfectly thrown open. Under the law the people were wont to stand at a distance
in the porch; but now nothing hinders us from entering into the sanctuary
itself, because</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"the veil of the temple
hath been rent."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;402751&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
27:51.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus we have admission into heaven through
Christ,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"that we may approach
with freedom and boldness to the throne of grace, to obtain mercy and find
needful
assistance."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580416&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Hebrews
4:16.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A question will be put. "Are there no believers in
the world, and is there no kingdom of Christ, in the present day? For it does
not appear that God is so ready to render assistance, and there is no visible
fruit of our prayers." I reply. Though it becomes fully evident that we have
been heard when the event actually proves it, yet God does not in the meantime
overlook us; for he does not permit us to faint, but supports us by the power of
his Spirit, that we may wait for him patiently. Nor does he delay, as men do,
because he has need of time, but because he wishes to exercise and try our
patience. In a word, there are two ways in which God listens to us; first, when
he renders assistance openly; and secondly, when he aids us by the power of his
Spirit, that we may not sink under the weight of afflictions. And if this
doctrine were deeply fixed in the hearts of men, they would fly to God more
readily and boldly, and would not dispute so eagerly about calling on saints.
For how comes it that men contrive for themselves such a variety of
intercessors, to whom they betake themselves rather than to Christ, but because
they do not receive that doctrine, and because they reject such large and
bountiful promises?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The wolf and the lamb shall
feed together.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He means that everything shall
be fully restored, when Christ shall reign. And here it appears as if there were
an implied comparison between Adam and Christ. We know that all the afflictions
of the present life flowed from the sin of the first man; for at that time we
were deprived of the dominion and sovereignty which God had given to man
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
1:28) over animals of every kind, all of which at first undoubtedly bowed
cheerfully to the dominion of man, and were obedient to his will; but now the
most of them rise up against man, and even carly on mutual war against each
other. Thus, when wolves, bears, lions, and other savage animals of that kind,
are hurtful to man and to other beasts from which we obtain some advantage, and
when even animals which ought to have been useful to man are hostile to him,
this ought to be imputed to his sin, because his disobedience overthrew the
order of things. But since it is the office of Christ to bring back everything
to its condition and order, that is the reason why he declares that the
confusion or ruin that now exists in human affairs shall be removed by the
coming of Christ; because at that time, corruptions having been taken away, the
world shall return to its first
origin.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the lion shall eat
straw like the ox.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> "The lion" shall eat
harmlessly, and shall no longer seek his prey. The serpent, satisfied with his
dust, shall wrap himself in it, and shall no longer hurt by his envenomed bite.
In a word, all that is disordered or confused shall be restored to its proper
order. Yet beyond all controversy the Prophet speaks allegorically of bloody and
violent men, whose cruel and savage nature shall be subdued, when they submit to
the yoke of Christ. But first we must carefully consider that confusion which
befell all the creatures in consequence of the fall of man; for if this were not
taken into view, it would be impossible for us to have sufficiently just and
correct views of this blessing of restoration. At the same time, we must keep in
remembrance what we said in expounding a similar allegory in the eleventh
chapter. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1059</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Here we are taught what is the nature of men before the Lord convert them and
receive them into his fold; for they are cruel and untamed beasts, and only
begin to abstain from doing any injury, when the Lord subdues their wicked
inclination and their furious desire to do
harm.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In all my holy
mountain.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is added because, when rubbish
and filth have been taken out of the way, the Lord will gather to himself a
Church without spot. By the word all he means cleansing. Yet we ought not to
think it strange that still so many are ferocious; for there are few that are
the true inhabitants of God's mountain, few that are upright and faithful, even
among those who profess to be Christians. Seeing that the old man still reigns
and is vigorous in them, contentions and wars must also exist and prevail
amongst them.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This saith
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This discourse is different from the
preceding one; for here the Prophet exclaims against the Jews, who, puffed up
with vain confidence in the sacrifices and the temple, indulged freely in their
pleasures, and flattered themselves in their sins under this pretense. He shews
that this confidence is not only foolish and groundless, but diabolical and
accursed; for they grossly mock God who endeavor to serve and appease him by
outward ceremonies. Accordingly, he reproaches them with endeavoring to frame an
idol in place of God, when they shut him up in the temple. Next, he speaks of
the renovation of the Church, and of the extension of it throughout the whole
world.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Heaven is my
throne.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> His aim being to shake off the
self-complancency of the pretended or hypocritical worshippers of God, he begins
with his nature. By assigning "heaven" for his habitation, he means that the
majesty of God fills all things, and is everywhere diffused; and that he is so
far from being shut up in the temple, that he is not shut up or confined within
any place whatever. The Scripture often teaches that God is in heaven; not that
he is shut up in it, but in order that we may raise our minds above the world,
and may not entertain any low, or carnal, or earthly conceptions of him; for the
mere sight of heaven ought to carry us higher, and transport us into admiration.
And yet, in innumerable passages, he protests that he is with us, that his power
is everywhere diffused, in order that we may not imagine that he is shut up in
heaven.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It may be thought that this is beyond
all controversy, and was at that time acknowledged by all; for who did not know
that heaven and earth are filled by the majesty of God? They might therefore
object that there is no man who wishes to thrust God out of heaven, and that the
Prophet has no good reason for waxing wroth and breaking out into such violent
invective. And undoubtedly they rejected with great haughtiness this doctrine of
the Prophet, and were highly irritated and enraged, as if great injury had been
done to them. But it is easy to reply that, when men endeavor to appease God
according to their own fancy, they frame an idol that is altogether contrary to
his majesty, Relying on their useless ceremonies, they thought that they had
performed their duty well when they went frequently to the temple, and offered
in it prayers and sacrifices. The Prophet shews that the majesty of God must not
be measured by this standard, and that all that they bring forward,
unaccompanied by purity of heart, are absolute trifles; for since it is evident
from his dwelling-place being in heaven that the nature of God is spiritual, if
the worship do not correspond to that nature, it is undoubtedly wicked and
corrupted.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Where is that house
which ye will build for me?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Under the word
house or temple he includes all the ceremonies in which they thought that the
worship of God consisted; and because they measured God and his worship by the
temple as a standard, the Prophet shews that it is unworthy of God's majesty to
view his presence as confined to a visible and frail building. He does not argue
merely about God's essence, but at the same time discourses concerning his true
worship, which he shews to be spiritual, in order that it may correspond to the
nature of God, who "is a Spirit."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430424&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
4:24.) And if men diligently considered what is the nature of God, they would
not contrive foreign and new modes of worship for him, or measure him by
themselves. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1060</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This common and often expressed sentiment is more weighty and energetic than if
the Prophet had brought forward something new; for he shews that they are so
stupid and dull as to be ignorant of that which was well known to the merest
idiot, and that they resemble dumb beasts in imagining that God dwells and
reposes in the temple. He therefore asks contemptuously, "Where is that house?"
For it was absurd to think either that God dwells on the earth, or that he is
concealed and shut up in a prison. Besides, the temple was built on a small
mountain, and could not contain the glory of God within its limited
dimensions.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And where is this
place of my rest?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> And yet the Lord had said of
the temple, "This is my rest for ever; here will I dwell, for I have chosen
it,."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19D214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
132:14.) In another passage it was said, "Enter, O Lord, into thy rest."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;140641&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 6:41.) Besides, we have seen, in a former part of this book, that
"the Lord's rest shall be glorious in it."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;231110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
11:10.) Finally, this was the ordinary designation of the temple, and yet the
Prophet now finds fault with it. I reply, the temple is called God's rest,
because he gave the token of his presence in the temple; for he had chosen it as
the place where men should call upon him, and from which he would give a display
of his strength and power. But he did not command it to be built in order that
men might conceive of his majesty according to their own fancy, 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1061</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but rather that, reminded by the outward signs of God's presence, they might
raise their minds higher and rise to heaven, and acknowledge that God is greater
and more excellent than the whole world. Yet, as the minds of men are prone to
superstition, the Jews converted into obstacles to themselves those things which
were intended to be aids; and when they ought to have risen by faith to heaven,
they believed that God was bound to them, and worshipped him only in a careless,
manner, or rather made sport of worshipping him at their own
pleasure.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This passage is very appropriately
quoted by Stephen,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;440749&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
7:49,) and is indirectly accommodated by Paul to the sense which we have now
stated; for they shew that those persons are grievously deceived and far astray
who bring to God carnal ceremonies, as if pure worship and religion consisted of
them, or who wickedly and profanely disfigure his worship by statues and images.
Stephen addresses the Jews, who, being attached to the figures of the Law,
disregarded true godliness; while Paul, speaking to the Gentiles, affirms that
"God dwelleth not in temples made with hands."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;441724&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
17:24.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yet my hand hath made all
these things.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet refutes the false
opinion which men form about the worship of God, by thinking that sacrifices and
outward ceremonies are of great value in themselves; for the state of the
question is this. God cares nothing about ceremonies, but they are empty and
useless masks, when men think that they satisfy God by means of them. When he
says that he made all these things, this must not be understood as referring
solely to the temple, but to all that was there offered to God. Now he says that
he "made all these things," in order that men may know that God has no need of
this external worship, as he declares
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;195010&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
50:10) that all the animals were created by him, and are his own, though by
sacrifices of them the Jews hoped to obtain his favor. But foolish mortals have
this disease deeply seated in them, that they transform God according to their
inclination, though he appointed external worship not for his sake, but for our
advantage; that is, that we may be trained by it according to the capacity of
our flesh.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And all these
things began to be.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is the same as if he had
said that he must not be compared to these things, which at one time began to
be; for he is eternal and had no beginning. "I could dispense with your
sacrifices," saith the Lord, "for, before they began to be, I was, and therefore
they can be of no service to me." In short, he maintains that ceremonies are of
no avail in themselves, but aim at a different object. Isaiah takes for granted
that it is impossible that God could receive any addition; and hence it follows
that he is satisfied with himself alone; for he could do without the world from
all eternity.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I look to
him who is humble and contrite in spirit.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Next,
a definition of lawful worship is added; for, when he says that God "looketh to
the humble," I have no doubt that he who is "humble and contrite in spirit" is
indirectly contrasted by him with the array, and splendor, and elegance of
ceremonies, by which the eyes of men are commonly dazzled, so as to be carried
away in admiration. On the other hand, the Lord testifies that he demands humble
and downcast minds, and that tremble at his commandments. By these words he
describes inward purity of heart and sincere desire of godliness, and at the
same time shews in what way we ought to be prepared to please
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And trembleth at my
word.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> So far as relates to "trembling," it
might be thought strange at first sight that he demands it in believers, since
nothing is more sweet or gentle than the word of the Lord, and nothing is more
opposite to it than to excite terror. I reply, there are two kinds of trembling;
one by which they are terrified who hate and flee from God, and another which
affects the heart, and promotes the obedience, of those who reverence and fear
God. This clause, I am aware, is viewed by others as relating to the Law, which
threatens and terrifies, and proclaims the dreadful judgment of God. But I take
it in a more general acceptation; for even believers tremble at the promises
when they embrace them with reverence. Hence infer that true godliness consists
in having our senses brought into a state of obedience to God, and in making no
boastful or wicked claims for ourselves. The nature of faith is to yield
obedience to God, and to listen to him attentively and patiently when he speaks.
But when we are puffed up and carried away by a vain confidence in ourselves, we
have no piety or fear of God; for we cannot make even the smallest claim for
ourselves without despising God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We ought
carefully to mark the expression which he employs, "Trembling at the word of
God." Many boast that they reverence and fear God; but, by disregarding his
word, they at the same time shew that they are despisers of God. All the
reverence that we owe to God must be paid to his word, in which he wishes to be
fully recognised as in a lively image. The amount of what is said is, that God
prefers this sacrifice to all others, when believers, by true self-denial, lie
low in such abasement as to have no lofty opinion about themselves, but to
permit themselves to be reduced to nothing. Thus also the Psalmist says, "The
sacrifice acceptable to God is a contrite spirit; an afflicted heart, O God,
thou wilt not despise."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;195117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
51:17.) Because this modesty of faith produces obedience, this pious feeling is
likewise added, that, laying aside all obstinacy, they tremble at the word of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">From these words we ought to draw a
remarkable consolation, "Though we appear to be wretched in our abasement and
humility, and though we appear to be unworthy of being beheld by men, yet we are
truly happy; because the Lord looks upon us, and bestows on us his favor." When
we are tempted to despair, let us think that in this way the Lord exalts his
servants to heaven, though they have been cast down to hell, and almost sink
under the burden.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that killeth an ox, as if
he slew a man.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There are two clauses in this
verse. In the former, Isaiah plainly declares that all the sacrifices of his
nation are of no value in the sight of God, but are held by him in abomination;
in the latter, he describes the dreadful corruption by which they mingled the
ceremonies of the Gentiles with the sacrifices of the Law, and in this way
corrupted and perverted everything. The greater part of commentators think that
these words repeal the sacrifices of the Law, but this is a mistake; for Isaiah,
in this passage, treats of the same subject of which he had formerly treated in
the first and fifty-eighth chapters, and does not absolutely condemn sacrifices,
but rather the blemishes and corruptions of them, because the Jews thought that
God was satisfied with a deceitful and empty appearance, and at the same time
cared not about the true fear of God and a pure conscience. He does not speak,
therefore, of the thing itself, but censures men who abused sacrifices; because
this was as much as to offer to God the shell of an empty nut. In a word, no
sacrifices are acceptable to God but those which proceed from a pure heart and
an upright will.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet it is probable that the
Prophet alludes to the sacrifices of the Gentiles, which were shocking and
monstrous; for they killed men, or buried them alive. Neither the Romans, (who
reckoned themselves to be more religious than other nations,) nor even the Jews,
abstained from this crime. Nay more,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kako&gt;zhloi</font><font face="Palatino">)
wicked imitators polluted themselves by many child-murders, thinking that they
followed their father Abraham. Isaiah says that, "when they kill an ox, they do
the same thing as if they slew a man;" 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1062</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and thus he shews that the Jews, though they had a religion which was peculiar
and which God had appointed, yet were in no respect better than the Gentiles,
among whom everything was polluted and profane, and were not more highly
approved by God; because the name of God is profaned by hypocrisy of religion
not less than by corrupted and false worship. How necessary this admonition was,
we have formerly seen; for, while the Jews were convicted of all crimes, yet, so
long as they concealed themselves under this shadow, they thought that they were
safe. Justly therefore does the Prophet meet them by saying, that they gain
nothing more by their attempts to appease God than if they sought to offer
sacrifices from the abominable sacrileges of the
Gentiles.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And truly they have
chosen their own ways.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There are two
interpretations of this passage; for the antecedent to the pronoun may either be
the Gentiles or the Jews; that is, either that the Jews mingled and entangled
themselves with the wicked ceremonies of the Gentiles, or that they followed
their own inventions. The former exposition would not be inappropriate, were it
not that it is unnatural, because the word "Gentiles" has not been formerly
expressed. It was the most aggravated part of the wickedness of the Jews, that
they not only abused the pure worship of God, but likewise, through their
contempt of the Law, defiled the temple and every other place by wicked and
abominable superstitions. They built altars on high places, planted and reared
groves, took delight in games and public entertainments, and copied everything
else that was appointed by public authority for the purpose of corrupting the
hearts of men. Thus there was produced among them a confused medley of
superstitions, such as we now behold in Popery, in which we see various patches
sewed together, taken out of every kind of superstitions, not only heathen and
Jewish, but likewise such as have been recently contrived by Satan, that he
might more easily, and with greater plausibility, impose on the world. These and
similar practices the Prophet would justly pronounce to be doubly worthy of
condemnation, because, while they boast of the name of God, and make profession
of his worship, still they are not ashamed to stain and pollute that worship by
the sacrileges of idolatrous nations.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The other
interpretation is not obscure, and is equally appropriate, that the Jews were
devoted to their own inventions, and followed their own abominations, He affirms
that they do not worship God sincerely, who despise him according to their own
caprice, not only because they are full of avarice, hatred, ambition,
dishonesty, cruelty, and extortion, but because they corrupt the worship of God
by their own contrivances. Although the pronoun refers to the Jews, yet the
Prophet condemns all superstitions which they had borrowed from the heathen
nations. Consequently, there is little difference between the two
interpretations; for he merely teaches that, because they have insolently and
rebelliously shaken off the yoke of God, because wickedness openly prevails
among them, everything that proceeds from them is polluted and detestable.
Streams that bring down dirty and offensive matter from a muddy and polluted
fountain cannot be clean or pure. Choice and desire reveal their obstinacy more
clearly; that is, because, knowingly and willingly, they despised God's
commandments, and devoted their heart to everything that was opposed to them, as
if they wished intentionally to disdain everything that proceeded from God, that
they might obey their depraved lust.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I also will choose their
delusions.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1063</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The Prophet means that the Jews gain nothing by holding out various and
plausible pretences and by searching for excuses; because God does not care for
the cunning or fine speeches of men. And indeed it is not proper to measure God
by our own capacity, and we ought not to depend on human judgment; but it is our
duty to judge of the works of God from his word. I will choose; that is, "I will
scatter the clouds which they endeavor to spread over themselves, so that their
delusions shall be manifest and visible to all; for now they appear to be
hidden, but one day they shall be dragged forth to public view." The meaning may
be thus summed up. "Because the Jews have indulged so freely in sinning that
everything which they chose was preferred by them to the command ments of God,
so also, in his turn, God will lay open their delusions at his
pleasure."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And will bring upon
them their terror.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1064</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Under the word "terror" he repeats the same thing, according to the custom of
Hebrew writers. "I will cause them to know that they have fallen into a mistake,
and that the terrors which they indulged shall fall on their own heads. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1065</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Thus their excuses or hypocritical pretences will be of no avail for confounding
truth and falsehood and veiling superstitions; because the Lord will clearly
distinguish between
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because I
called.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet again condemns the Jews for
obstinacy, in not having suffered the Lord to correct them. This is the only
remedy that remains for correcting our vices, that we hear the Lord speaking,
when he endeavors to bring us back into the right way; but when we sear and
harden our hearts, it is the worst of all evils. Whenever therefore men prefer
their own inventions to the ordinances and commandments of God, they openly
despise God, to whose will they ought to have yielded. This is especially the
case when there is added such obstinate hardness of heart as shuts the door
against holy warnings, and it is vain for them to allege that they cannot
displease God by doing that which they undertake for the purpose of worshipping
him; for all that men, by neglecting the word, choose and follow, the Lord
rejects and abhors.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Before
mine eyes.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He repeats what he had formerly
said, that the Jews sinned in the sight of God, as if they had resolved to
provoke him to anger. At length he adds their manner of doing so, that, with
perverse desire, they sought what God had forbidden; nor is it without good
reason that he so frequently censures the wicked insolence of men, in defrauding
God of his right, by treating contemptuously what he
approves.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear the word of
Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He directs his discourse to the true
worshippers of God, and promises to them what they could scarcely have expected
during those terrible calamities; and he expressly addresses them, because at
that time there were many who falsely boasted of the name of God. Nay more,
leaving the undistinguished multitude, he directs his discourse separately to a
small number, as he formerly said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Seal the law, bind the

8:16.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye who tremble at my
word.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He points out the true and sincere
children of God, by this mark, that they "tremble at the word of the Lord." This
indeed is an uncommon virtue; and therefore he contrasts it with the false
profession of those who, by bearing the outward mark of circumcision, wished to
be reckoned among the people of God, and made a great profession and show of
holiness; that we may know that they alone reverence and fear God who reverence
and fear his holy word; that is, who, in consequence of being powerfully
impressed by hearing the voice of God, constrain all their senses to obey; for
this is a remarkable proof of
godliness.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Your brethren
said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Because it is customary with hypocritical
worshippers of God to make loud boasting of their pompous ritual, the design of
the Prophet is, to arm and fortify believers for enduring their attacks, that
they may not give way when they are mocked and insulted. As if he had said, "You
have to contend not only with foreign nations, but with domestic foes, who hold
a place in the Church, and who are bound by the tie of brotherhood on account of
the covenant of God which is common to you all. If they mock at your simplicity
in the same manner as they haughtily despise God himself, you must boldly and
fearlessly resist that temptation." He therefore calls them "brethren," although
they were enemies of believers and of the word of God, for it is by way of
concession that he gives to them that name which they falsely usurped. Hence we
infer that this is not a new evil, that enemies, who bear the name of brethren,
are nourished in the bosom of the Church. This internal war must be incessantly
carried on with hypocrites, who cannot patiently endure that we shall worship
God with an honest and upright
conscience.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Casting you out
for the sake of my name.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Literally, "bidding
you begone." As we see the Pope thundering dreadfully against us, as if we had
been base and worthless persons; so hypocrites were casting out the small number
of believers; for, being superior in number, authority, and wealth, they
likewise exercise that tyranny in such a manner that they approve or disapprove
of everything according to their own caprice, and cause that believers may be
reckoned as of no value, whom they not only overwhelm by their vast numbers, as
the chaff does the wheat, but also trample proudly under their
feet.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let Jehovah be
glorified.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Or, in the future tense, "Jehovah
will be glorified." Others translate it, "Jehovah is severe;" but let us see
which is the preferable meaning. They who translate it, "Jehovah is severe,"
think that wicked men complain of God's excessive severity, in not sparing his
people and in acting severely toward them; and they think that by this word the
people were tempted to despair; for, when wicked men endeavor to turn us aside
from God, they take away all hope and confidence of salvation. But I give the
preference to either of the other two expositions. That which is most generally
approved is the following. Wicked men laughed at the prophecies and promises,
because that glory which the Prophets had so frequently mentioned was nowhere to
be seen; as if they had said, "Let the Lord display some testimony of his glory,
that we may safely rely on it;" and therefore the Prophet wishes to arm
believers against such blasphemy, that they may not allow their faith to be
overturned by the sneers of wicked men. But this passage might be appropriately
and perhaps more correctly interpreted to mean, that wicked men have promised
very great things for themselves, as if by their good deeds they had deserved
God's favor, as
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;300518&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Amos
5:18 also reproaches them, that, while they fearlessly provoke God, they
confidently trust that he will be gracious to them. Since, therefore, relying on
their sacrifices, they scorned all threatenings, and boasted that God would
assist them, he replies that they shall see the glory of God in a very different
manner. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1066</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But
he will be seen to your joy.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As if he had said,
"God, by his coming, will cause believers to know that they have not hoped in
vain; for he will appear for the advantage of believers, and for the destruction
of those who maintain that he will appear as the defender of wickedness, of
which he will be the severe avenger. The former shall enjoy gladness and
consolation, while the latter shall be ashamed and shall blush, for they shall
quickly feel that the judgment of God, which they now laugh at, is at
hand."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A voice of tumult from the
city, a voice from the temple.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He confirms the
preceding statement; namely, that God hath not threatened in vain, that he will
speedily come to take vengeance on hypocrites, in order that what has been
promised concerning gladness may be more eagerly expected by believers. It is
uncertain what are the enemies whom he describes; for this passage may be
explained as relating to the Babylonians, whose destruction was the deliverance
of his Church. It may also be explained as relating to other enemies, who were
nourished in the bosom of the Church; and I am more favorable to this opinion,
though I do not deny that it may be viewed in reference to any kind of enemies.
But he has in his eye domestic foes, of whom he had formerly spoken, who
disdained the voice of God continually addressing them by the mouth of the
prophets. He therefore threatens that they shall speedily hear another and more
terrible voice; but there is immediately added a mitigation, that the same
terror may not discourage the believing servants of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino">The meaning may be thus summed up. "In vain
do wicked men boast and set their own obstinacy in opposition to the judgments
of God, for they shall not escape his hand, and even 'from the temple,' which
was their lurking-place of false confidence, his voice shall come forth, and
believers will then receive the fruit of their patience." Would that we did not
at the present day experience similar contempt in hypocrites, who set at nought
all remonstrances and threatenings, and have no respect for the word of God! To
them, therefore, instead of the mild and gentle voice which they now hear, we
are compelled to threaten "a tumultuous voice," which they shall one day hear
from other and very different masters; for since the world, with irreligious
scorn, disdains the word of God, it shall be constrained not only to hear, but
likewise to experience, an armed voice, that is, fire and
sword.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Before she travailed, she
brought forth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Having formerly comforted
believers, that they might not be discouraged by the insolence and contempt of
brethren, whom he would at length punish, and having thus commanded them to wait
for the coming of the Lord with a steady and resolute heart, the Lord at the
same time adds, that he will punish them in such a manner that, by their
destruction, he will provide for the safety of believers. Nor does he speak of
one or two men, but of the whole Church, which he compares to a woman. The same
metaphor has already been sometimes employed by him; for God chiefly aims at
gathering us into one body, that we may have in it a testimony of our adoption,
and may acknowledge him to be a father, and may be nourished in the womb of the
Church as our mother. This metaphor of a mother is therefore highly appropriate.
It means that the Church shall be restored in such a manner that she shall
obtain a large and numerous offspring, though she appear for a time to be
childless and barren.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Before
her pain came upon her.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He repeats the same
statement which he has already employed on other occasions; but he expresses
something more, namely, that this work of God shall be sudden and unexpected;
for he guards believers against carnal views, that they may not judge of the
restoration of the Church according to their own opinion. Women carry a child in
the womb for nine months, and at length give birth to it with great pain. But
the Lord has a very different manner of bringing forth children; for he says
that he will cause the child to see the light, before it be possible to perceive
or discern it by any feeling of pain. On this account he likewise claims the
whole praise for himself, because a miracle sets aside the industry of
men.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>She brought forth a
male.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He expressly mentions "a male," in order
to describe the manly and courageous heart of these children; for he means that
they shall be a noble offspring, and not soft or effeminate. In like manner we
know that believers are regenerated by the Spirit of Christ, that they may
finish, with unshaken fortitude, the course of their warfare; and in this sense
Paul says that they "have not the spirit of timidity."

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who hath heard such a
thing?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He extols the greatness of the thing of
which he has spoken; for he means that there shall be a wonderful and "unheard
of" restoration of the Church; so that believers shall not judge of it from the
order of nature, but from the grace of God; for when men reflect upon it:. they
think that it is like a dream, as the Psalmist says.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19C601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
126:1.) He does not mean that the Church shall be restored perfectly and in a
moment; for the advancement of this restoration is great and long-continued, and
is even slow in the estimation of the flesh; but he shews that even the
beginning of it exceeds all the capacity of the human understanding. And yet he
does not speak hyperbolically; for we often see that the Church brings forth,
which previously did not appear to be pregnant. Nay more, when she is thought to
be barren, she is rendered fruitful by the preaching of the gospel; so that we
greatly admire the event, when it has happened, which formerly we reckoned to be
altogether incredible.</font><br><font face="Palatino">These things were
fulfilled in some measure, when the people returned from Babylon; but a far
brighter testimony was given in the gospel, by the publication of which a
diversified and numerous offspring was immediately brought forth. In our own
times, have we not seen the fulfillment of this prophecy? How many children has
the Church brought forth during the last thirty years, in which the gospel has
been preached? Has not the Lord his people, at the present day, in vast numbers,
throughout the whole world? Nothing, therefore, has been here foretold that is
not clearly seen.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall a
nation be born at once?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He illustrates the
glory of the miracle by a metaphor. No "nation" ever came into the world in an
instant; for it is by degrees that men assemble, and grow in number, and spread
their nation. But the case is very different with the Church, which all at once,
and in more than one place, brings forth a vast number of children. It amounts
to this, that God, in a wonderful manner, will cause innumerable children of the
Church, in an extraordinary manner, to be born all at once and
suddenly.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall a land be

lofty terms the work of God, so he now shews that it ought not to be thought
incredible, and that we ought not to doubt of his power, which surpasses all the
order of nature; for, if we consider who it is that speaks, and how easy it is
for him to perform what he has promised, we shall not remain in such uncertainty
as not instantly to recollect that the renewal of the world is in the hand of
him, who would have no difficulty in creating a hundred worlds in a moment. A
little before, by a burst of astonishment, he intended to magnify the greatness
of the work. But now, lest the minds of good men should be perplexed or
embarrassed, he exhorts them to consider his strength; and, in order that he may
more fully convince them that nothing is so difficult in the eyes of men as not
to be in his power and easily performed by him, he brings forward those things
which we see every day; for in a woman's bringing forth a child we see clearly
his wonderful power. Shall not the Lord manifest himself to be far more
wonderful in enlarging and multiplying the Church, which is the principal
theater of his glory? It is therefore exceedingly wicked to limit his strength,
by believing that he is less powerful, when he shall choose to act directly and
by openly stretching out his hand, than when he acts by natural
means.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rejoice ye with
Jerusalem.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He promises that they who formerly
were sad and melancholy shall have a joyful condition; for Isaiah has in view
not his own age, but the time of the captivity, during which believers
continually groaned, and, overwhelmed with grief, almost despaired; and
therefore he exhorts and stimulates to joy all believers, who are moved by
strong affection toward the Church, and reckon nothing more desirable than her
prosperity. In this way he instructs them that none shall have a share in so
valuable a blessing but they who are prompted by a godly love of the Church, and
desire to seek her deliverance, and that too when she is contemptible in the
eyes of the world; as the Psalmist says,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">And therefore he adds,
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All ye that mourn for
her;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> for, since in the captivity there was
frightful and shocking desolation, and there appeared to be no longer any hope
of safety, he arouses believers, and bids them be of good cheer, or at least
prepare themselves for joy. And this exhortation contains also a promise and
something more, for a bare promise would not have carried so much weight. But
those statements must not be limited exclusively to a single period; for we
ought to abide by the general rule, of which we have often spoken already,
namely, that those promises must be extended from the return of the people down
to the reign of Christ, and to the full perfection of that
reign.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>That ye may suck.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This verse ought
to be joined with the preceding verse; for the Prophet explains what shall be
the occasion of joy, namely, because the wretched and miserable condition of the
Church shall be changed into a happy and prosperous condition. By the word
"suck" he makes an allusion to young infants; as if he had said, "That you may
enjoy your mother with every advantage, and may hang on her breasts." Here all
believers, whatever may be their age, are compared by him to children, that they
may remember their infirmity and may be confirmed by the strength of the Lord;
and therefore this metaphor of "sucking" and "milking" ought to be carefully
observed.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From the breast of
her consolations.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some take the word
"consolations" in an active, and others in a passive sense; but I prefer to
adopt the passive signification; for he means the consolations which the Church
has received, and of which he makes his children partakers. And indeed none can
be greater or more abundant, none can be more excellent, than that ground of
joy; and this appears more clearly from the following clause, "that ye may be
delighted with the brightness of her
glory."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>I cause peace to flow on her like a
river.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He continues his metaphor, and compares
the children of God to infants, that are carried in the arms, and warmed in the
bosom of their mothers, who even play with them. And in order that he may
express more strongly his affection toward us, he compares himself to a mother,
whose love, as we have formerly seen, (page 30,) exceeds every other by a wide
interval.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234915&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
49:15.) The Lord wishes to be to us in the room of a mother, that, instead of
the annoyances, reproaches, distresses, and anxieties, which we have endured, he
may treat us gently, and, as it were, fondle us in his bosom. By the word
"peace" he means
prosperity.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the glory of
the Gentiles as an overflowing torrent.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The
word "glory" contains a repetition, by which he denotes every kind of riches, so
that nothing is wanting to full and perfect peace; for, since the Gentiles had
formerly lived luxuriously, and had enjoyed a vast abundance of everything
desirable, he affirms that all riches, and everything that belongs to a happy
life, shall be possessed by believers, as the rivers run into the sea. By
"constant flowing" he denotes continuance; for, since God is an inexhaustible
fountain, his peace differs widely from the peace of the world, which quickly
passes away and is dried up. Whenever therefore we behold the sad and melancholy
condition of the Church, let us remember that these promises relate to us not
less than to that people. Seeing that the Lord has rivers of peace which he
wishes to cause to flow into his Church, let us not despair even amidst the
fiercest wars; but, in our distresses and straits, let us cheer our hearts and
rejoice. When he takes pleasure in us as infants, and not as men of mature age,
we ought to acknowledge our condition, that we may be satisfied with such
consolations. And indeed it is a token of remarkable condescension that he thus
bears with our weakness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whom his mother

who appeared to have already spoken enough about this renewal, dwells on it so
largely. But, because he can neither express the greatness and warmth of the
love which God bears toward us, nor satisfy himself with speaking about it, for
that reason he mentions and repeats it
frequently.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And you shall have
consolation in Jerusalem.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There are two ways in
which this may be explained. It may be said that believers shall have joyful
hearts, when they shall behold the Church restored; or, that the Church, after
having been restored, shall discharge her duty by gladdening her children. I
prefer the latter interpretation, though either of them is admissible. The
former appears to be a richer interpretation; but we must consider what the
Prophet meant, and not what we think the most beautiful. In the first place,
indeed, he makes God the author of the joy, and justly; but, in the second
place, he adds that Jerusalem is his handmaid. But this is not addressed to
irreligious scorners, who are not moved by any solicitude about the Church, but
to those who, with holy zeal, declare that they are her
children.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And ye shall
see.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By the word "see," he expresses undoubted
experience, that believers may not doubt as to the result, but, embracing this
prediction with full belief, may patiently endure for a time the barrenness of
the Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And your bones
shall flourish as grass.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He illustrates his
former statement by a metaphor, saying that "their bones" shall regain their
former vigor, as faded "grass" becomes fresh and green again. He mentions the
"bones," which are commonly dried up by a melancholy spirit,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;201722&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
17:22,) and, on the other hand, are replenished and invigorated by a happy and
cheerful disposition. Thus he describes an ardent and invaluable joy, and seems
to allude to the sadness by which believers had been almost dried up during the
captivity, and had become like dead men. The Lord therefore comforts them, and
promises that the Church shall flourish, and shall abound in everything that is
desirable; as if bones, that wanted moisture, should regain their former vigor,
or as grass, which appears to be dead during the winter, recovers its freshness
every year.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the hand of
Jehovah shall be known toward his servants.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
That they may cherish confidence, he nexts bids them rise to God, who will then
reveal his assistance. It follows from this, that the hand of God has not always
been known, but has sometimes remained concealed, as if he had no care about his
people. At first sight, he appeared to have cast them off; for Daniel, and other
good men,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;270106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
1:6,) not less than Zedekiah,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;245209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
52:9,) were carried into captivity. He says, that when the fine weather shall
smile upon them, there shall be such a distinction between the good and the bad,
as to make manifest this hand, which formerly was in some measure hidden;
because he will no longer conceal himself, or permit the wicked to ravage
without control, but will openly shew how great is his solicitude about his
people. If therefore for a time the enemies have the superiority, and pursue
their lawless course without being punished, if we appear to be overlooked and
destitute of all assistance, let us not despair; for the time will come when the
Lord will reveal himself, and will rescue us from their assaults and
tyranny.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.

(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">uJpotu&gt;pwsiv</font><font face="Palatino">)
lively description is, that believers, when they see worthless men laughing at
their distresses, and growing more and more insolent, may not on that account
turn aside from the right path, or lose courage; for he intended not only to
smite wicked men, who are moved by no threatenings, and scorn all instruction, 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1068</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but to comfort good men, that they may feel that they are happy, because they
are under God's protection; and may not attach themselves to the wicked on
account of the prosperity of all their undertakings. Their advantage is,
therefore, what he has chiefly in view, that they may be satisfied with God's
protection and grace. But it may admit of doubt whether or not he includes the
last judgment, along with the temporal punishments with which he now begins to
chastise the wicked. For my own part, I have no doubt that he intends to include
that judgment also, along with those which were only the forerunners of eternal
destruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Will
come.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This began to be accomplished, when, by
carrying away the people to Babylon, God took vengeance on domestic foes. Next,
when the time of the deliverance was accomplished, he attacked more severely the
wicked Gentiles by an armed force, and ceased not to give other and various
proofs of his approach, by which he shewed himself to be present with the elect
people, and came in fire to judge their enemies. Lastly, we know that he will
come in fire at the last day, to take vengeance on all the wicked. But this
passage ought not to be limited to the last judgment, so as to include all the
rest. Yet these threatenings, as we shall see soon afterwards, are especially
directed by the Prophet against hypocritical
Jews.</font><br><font face="Palatino">These metaphorical expressions are very
customary in Scripture; for we could not comprehend this dreadful judgment of
God in any other way than by the Prophets employing metaphors drawn from known
and familiar objects.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;530108&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Thessalonians 1:8;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;610307&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Peter 3:7.) By means of them the prophets endeavor to make a deep impression on
our senses, that, struck with the true fear of God, we may not envy the wicked,
for whom such dreadful vengeance is prepared. Hence we see how trivial and
useless are the speculations of the Sophists, who dispute about the refined
nature and qualities of that fire; for the design of Scripture is to point out
to us under figures the dreadful judgment of God, which otherwise we could not
imagine or understand. This is still more evident from the word "sword," in the
following verse; for it conveys the same
meaning.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For Jehovah will judge in
fire.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he brings forward nothing new, but
merely confirms the former statement, and shews that this judgment will be
dreadful; that none may think that it is a matter of small importance.
Accordingly, he describes that horror in strong language, that the wicked may
fear, and that believers, on the other hand, may keep themselves holy and
chaste, and may withdraw from the society of the wicked. Yet let them endure
patiently the unjust and cruel attacks of enemies, till the armed avenger come
forth front heaven. 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1069</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
many shall be the slain of Jehovah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He
threatens the destruction of all men, so that there may be a prodigious mass of
corpses. And he expressly added this, because ungodliness reigned everywhere,
and believers were subjected to a dangerous temptation on account of the
prosperity of the wicked; for such is the fickleness of our minds, that we allow
ourselves to be led away by a bad custom, and are alarmed by a multitude, as if
it were sufficient for restraining the hand of God. This sinful fear the Prophet
corrects by reminding' them, that the more ungodliness shall abound, and the
greater the number of wicked men, so much the more will the wrath of the Lord be
kindled, that he may make a greater and more extensive slaughter; and the
multitude and conspiracy of the ungodly shall not hinder him from carrying them
away by the same ruin.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.

that God's anger would be kindled against them; for it might have been doubtful
whether he spoke of foreign and avowed enemies, or directed his discourse to the
despisers of God, although they had been mixed with those who were elect and
holy; and therefore he plainly addresses the false and degenerate Jews. Nor have
I any doubt that, in the first place, he rebukes hypocrites, and, in the second
place, when he says, "Who eat swine's flesh," he describes men of immoral lives,
that is, those who were openly wicked and grossly licentious. Hypocrites
sanctified themselves, that is, assumed false disguises of holiness, and
deceived many under this pretense.</font><br><font face="Palatino">They
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>purified themselves in the

various superstitions, although they imagined that, by means of those
superstitions, they rendered themselves pure in the sight of God. Others,
without any reserve, despised God and all religion. It is therefore a general
statement, in which he includes all the ungodly, to whatever class they may
belong; that is, both those who openly display their wickedness, and those who
hide and cover it by various
disguises.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behind one in the

Some commentators supply the word "pool," or "laver;" as if holy water had been
placed "in the midst" of the garden for ablutions. But another meaning would be
equally appropriate; that every one chose a God for himself exclusively, and
therefore every one out of many trees had his own
tree.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.

He confirms what he said in the preceding verse; namely, that punishment shall
be executed on all the ungodly, in order that, although the Lord permit them for
a time to sin with impunity, yet believers, being convinced that they shall one
day be punished, may guard against following their example. The Lord here
testifies that he sees and observes their works, and that one day he will
actually manifest that none can be concealed from his eyes. Others understand by
it that the ungodly can accomplish nothing without God's permission. That
statement is indeed true, but is not applicable to this passage; for everybody
sees that it is unnatural, and at variance with the context of the Prophet, who
merely confirms what he formerly said, that hypocrites and wicked men shall not
finally escape with impunity, because God perceives all their actions, and
schemes, and thoughts; and that they gain nothing by their evasions, as if they
were never to be dragged to the
judgment.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because the time is
come.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> These words confirm still more what has
been already said, for he says that the time is at hand when he shall assemble
all the nations, that he may cast off the hypocrites and ungodly, and gather and
adopt a people to himself from among them. The Jews were puffed up with pride,
and despised all other nations as unholy. But the Lord declares that he will
adopt those nations, that they may be partakers of his glory, of which the Jews
prove themselves to be unworthy.</font><br><font face="Palatino">This is a
remarkable passage, which teaches us that God is not confined to any people, so
as not to choose whomsoever he pleases, by casting off unbelievers whom he
formerly called to himself. This is abundantly explained by Paul,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451019&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:19; 11:25,) where he shews that we have come into a possession which was left
empty, after the Jews were cast off through their unbelief. Isaiah now threatens
them in this manner. "Think not that God is in want of peoples when you have
revolted and have rendered yourselves unworthy of his grace, for he will have
others; but he will shew that he is the judge, and will not finally permit you
to abuse so great
forbearance."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall
come.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He says that "they shall come," because,
being ingrafted by unity of faith, they shall be united in the Church with the
true Jews, who have not swerved from the adoption; for, in consequence of the
Jews being near to God, the Gentiles, who were at a distance, must be joined to
them, that, by the removal of disagreement, they might become one
body.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And shall see my
glory.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To "see the glory" of the Lord, is
nothing else than to enjoy that grace which he had bestowed on the Jews; for the
special privilege of that nation was, that they beheld the glory of God, and had
tokens of his presence, he says that now the Gentiles, who had not enjoyed these
benefits, shall see and behold that glory, for the Lord will reveal himself to
all without exception.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will place in them a
sign.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This may be understood in two ways;
either that God holds out a sign, or that by some symbol or mark he seals his
own people, that they may be placed in safety. The former exposition is more
generally approved, but some reason childishly about it as relating to the sign
of the cross, while others refer it to the preaching of the Gospel. In my
opinion both are mistaken; for he seems rather to allude to what, Moses tells
us, happened at the departure and deliverance of the people. It is also declared
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;660703&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Revelation
7:3) that "as many as the Lord hath sealed" shall be safe, even when his anger
shall be fiercely kindled throughout the whole world; just as they whose
door-posts were marked in Egypt escaped safely.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;021213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
12:13.) And thus he shews that none can escape God's wrath, except the elect, on
whom the Lord has impressed his mark and
seal.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And will send some of
them, being reserved.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In a word, the Prophet
heightens the description of what has been already said about the grievous and
terrible vengeance which the Lord will execute on the ungodly; for all would
have perished without distinction if the Lord had not marked some of them with
his seal. From the general destruction of the whole nation, therefore, he says
that he will reserve a small number. And this is the true meaning of the
Prophet; just as he had said, in other passages, that he would rescue "a
remnant" from the general conflagration.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:9; 10:22.) Of this band, which had been reserved, he says that some shall be
his heralds to celebrate his name among the Gentiles; just as we see that the
doctrine of salvation, by the agency of a few, was spread far and
wide.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the nations of
Tarshish, Pul, and Lud.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By the name "Tarshish"
he denotes Cilicia, and includes the whole coast of the Mediterranean Sea
opposite to Judea. Others think that it denotes Africa and Cappadocia; but I
rather adopt the former view. By Lud, some suppose Lydia to be meant; and
others, Asia Minor. By "those who draw the bow" are meant the Parthians, because
they were skillful in archery. By Tubal and Javan he denotes Italy and Greece,
and by the Islands he denotes unknown countries; for by the name "Islands," as
we have seen on many former occasions, the Jews denoted all that lay beyond the
sea.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which have not heard my
name.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He means that the knowledge of God shall
be spread throughout the whole world; for the Greeks, Italians, Parthians,
Cilicians, and other nations had heard nothing about pure religion and the true
worship of God; and the whole world was plunged in the deepest darkness of
ignorance. He therefore promises that the glory of God shall be known in every
part of the world. The word "nations" is emphatic; for at that time the Lord was
known to not more than one people, but now he has revealed himself to
all.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall
bring.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he clearly explains what was
formerly said, namely, that all who shall escape and survive, though they be few
in number, shall nevertheless be priests, who shall bring sacrifices to God from
all places. He alludes to the ancient ceremony of the Law, though he points out
the difference that will be between those oblations and the sacrifices of the
ancient Law; for he appoints a new kind of punishment and new sacrifices. As he
had said that he would gather all the nations, so he now shews that the priests,
whom he had appointed, shall not labor in vain; for God will grant prosperity to
their undertakings.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All your
brethren.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He gives the name of "brethren" to
those who formerly were strangers; for he has in his eye the new relation which
arises from faith. We know that foreign nations were ingrafted by faith into the
family of Abraham. Yet others bring out a different meaning, which I do not
absolutely reject. "When God shall gather a new people to himself out of foreign
nations, the Jews, who had been scattered in all directions, shall be brought
into one place." This was also accomplished; but it seems more appropriate to
refer it to the calling of the Gentiles, because at that time, by the removal of
the difference, a brotherly relation began to be established among all whom God
wished to adopt to be his children. Abraham was the father of one nation, and
yet not all who were descended from him according to the flesh are accounted his
children; for the Ishmaelites and the Edomites were rejected.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450907&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:7.) The time when he became "the father of many nations"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011705&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
17:5;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
4:17) was when God adopted the Gentiles, and joined them to himself by a
covenant, that they might follow the faith of Abraham. And thus we see the
reason why the Prophet gives the name of "brethren" of the Jews to us, who
formerly were aliens from the Church of God. It is because he had previously
cast out of their place false and reprobate
brethren.</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is our duty to observe this fruit
which is produced by the godly labors of those who faithfully serve the Lord,
namely, that they "bring their brethren" from deadly errors to God, the fountain
of life. By this consolation they ought to cheer their hearts, and to support
them amidst the distresses and tribulations which they endure. The Lord does not
suffer any of his own people to perish. Thus it is a high enjoyment and
privilege, when he wishes to make use of our labors for delivering our
"brethren."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Out of all
nations.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He means that there shall no longer be
any difference between Jews and Gentiles; because God will throw down "the
partition-wall,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;490214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:14,) and will form a Church "out of all nations." And thus was fulfilled the
saying of David concerning Christ,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Ask of me; I will give
thee the nations for thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth for thy
possession."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;190208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
2:8.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he speaks of the "holy mountain," he
accommodates himself to the customs and usages of that period; for at Jerusalem
God was worshipped in the temple. But now the temple is everywhere diffused; for
everywhere we are at liberty to "lift up holy hands to God,"
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;540208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 2:8,) and there is no longer any distinction of places. He likewise
mentions oblations and sacrifices, which were offered in the temple; although
the sacrifices which are now to be offered differ widely from the ancient
sacrifices. But the prophets, as we have frequently remarked, were under a
necessity of borrowing comparisons from known and familiar objects. Formerly the
sacrifices were taken from the flocks and herds; but the Apostles and other
priests of Christ slew men themselves, and offered them as a living sacrifice to
God by the Gospel. Paul testifies that he discharged the office of the
priesthood, when he slew men by the sword of the Gospel, "that they might be an
offering acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
15:1 6.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">It is not therefore a legal priesthood,
and does not resemble that of the Papists, who say that they sacrifice Christ; 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1072</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but it is the priesthood of the Gospel, by which men are slain, in order that,
being renewed by the Spirit, they may be offered to the Lord. Thus, whomsoever
we can gain to Christ, we offer in sacrifice, that they may be wholly
consecrated to God. Moreover, every person sacrifices when he devotes and
dedicates himself to God, and offers to him unreserved obedience; and this is
the sacrifice which Paul calls "reasonable."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
12:1.) The end of our calling is here pointed out to be, that, washing away our
pollutions, and being dead to ourselves, we may learn to devote ourselves to the
cultivation of holiness.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With
horses and chariots.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There are some who
endeavor to find an allegory here, and who think that the Prophet made use of
the word "bring" on this account, that the Gospel does not constrain men by
fear, but rather draws them gently, so that of their own accord they betake
themselves to God, and run with cheerfulness and joy. But for my own part, I
take a simpler view of this passage. Because this doubt might arise in the minds
of many persons, "How is it possible that men shall come to us from countries so
distant?" he replies, "Horses, chariots, and carriages shall not be wanting; for
the Lord has at his command all that can be of service for assisting his people
and conducting them to the end which he has in view." Yet I do not deny that the
Gospel may be called a "chariot," because it conveys us to the hope of eternal
life; but I think that the Prophet simply declares that nothing shall hinder God
from gathering his Church, and that he will have at his command all the
necessary means, that none of the elect whom he has called may fail in the
middle of the course.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will even take some of
them for priests and Levites.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet
heightens the description of that which he had already declared about the
extraordinary grace of God. He had made known that the Church of God should be
collected out of all nations, so that, in spite of every difficulty and
obstruction, even distant nations should draw near to them. But now he proceeds
further, and instructs them that the Gentiles shall not only be adopted by God,
but shall also be elevated by him to the highest honor. Already it was a great
honor, that unclean and polluted nations were reckoned to be a holy people; but
now here is something far more wonderful, that they are elevated to the highest
pinnacle of rank.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Hence we see that the
priesthood under Christ is very different from what it was under the Law; for
under the Law one tribe exclusively was admitted to the priesthood, and the
Gentiles, as unclean, were so far from having it in their power to discharge
that priesthood, that they were even forbidden to enter into the temple; but now
all are admitted without distinction. Some expound this passage in a general
manner, that the Gentiles shall be priests; that is, shall offer themselves to
God, as Scripture frequently denominates all believers "a royal priesthood."
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 2:9;
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;660106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Revelation
1:6; 5:10.) But he appears to describe in an especial manner ministers and
teachers whom the Lord also chose from among the Gentiles, and appointed to
execute this distinguished office; that is, to preach the Gospel; such as Luke,
Timothy, and others of the same class, who offered spiritual sacrifices to God
by the Gospel.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For as the new
heavens.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he promises that the restoration
of the Church shall be of such a nature that it shall last for ever. Many might
be afraid that it would be ruined a second time; and therefore he declares that
henceforth, after having been restored by God, its condition shall be permanent.
Accordingly, he mentions here two benefits of surpassing excellence, restoration
and eternity. When he speaks of "new heavens" and a "new earth," he looks to the
reign of Christ, by whom all things have been renewed, as the Apostle teaches in
the Epistle to the Hebrews. Now the design of this newness is, that the
condition of the Church may always continue to be prosperous and happy. What is
old tends to decay; what is restored and renewed must be of longer continuance.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580813&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
8:13.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So shall your seed and
your name remain.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> God had promised that "the
sun and moon," so long as they remained in heaven, should be witnesses of the
eternal succession, that the posterity of David might not be cut off. But
because some interruption arose from the treachery and ingratitude of the
people, the restoration effected by Christ actually confirmed that prediction.
Justly, therefore, does Isaiah say, "Your sons shall succeed to you, and your
grandsons shall succeed to your sons;" and as God will establish the world, that
it may never perish, so the succession of the Church shall be perpetual, that it
may be prolonged through all ages.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In a word, he
explains what he had formerly said about renewing the world, that none may think
that this relates to trees, or beasts, or the order of the stars; for it must be
referred to the inward renewal of man. The ancients were mistaken when they
thought that these things related absolutely to the last judgment; and they had
not sufficiently weighed the context of the Prophet or the authority of the
Apostle. Yet I do not deny that they extend as far as to that judgment, because
we must not hope for a perfect restoration before Christ, who is the life of the
world, shall appear; but we must begin higher, even with that deliverance by
which Christ regenerates his people, that they may be new creatures.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;470701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 7:1.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From a month to his month,
and from a Sabbath to his Sabbath.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1073</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The Prophet again points out what shall be the difference between the nature of
the spiritual worship of God which shall be under the reign of Christ and of the
carnal worship which was under the Law. Sacrifices were offered every month at
the new moon. There were Sabbaths, and other festivals, and solemn days, which
they carefully observed. But under the reign of Christ there shall be a constant
and uninterrupted solemnity; for there are not fixed and stated days of
sacrifices on which we must go to Jerusalem, or offer anything in one place or
in another; but our oblations, festivals, and rejoicings are continued from day
to day in unbroken succession. Yet he alludes to the ancient custom of
sacrifices as we have already said that the prophets are frequently accustomed
to do.</font><br><font face="Palatino">So then the Lord wishes to have "pure
sacrifices" offered to him daily,
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600205&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 2:5,) not such as were formerly offered under the Law or are now offered
by Papists, who either rely foolishly on their ceremonies, as if they were
expiations of crime, or basely venture to sacrifice Christ, 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1074</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but spiritual sacrifices, that we may reverence and adore God with a pure and
sincere worship.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430424&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
4:24.) As to the opinion held by some, that this passage proves the abrogation
of the Law and of ancient ceremonies, it does not appear to me to rest on
sufficient grounds, it is indeed certain that those legal ceremonies have been
set aside, and that may be gathered from this passage; but in proof of that
point I would choose to employ other passages which contain stronger evidence.
There is only here a contrast between the Sabbath and festivals which were
celebrated under the Law, and the perpetual Sabbath which we have at the present
day.
(</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580409&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
4:9, 10.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall go
forth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We must not here attempt to obtain
subtle and ingenious interpretations; for he simply informs those who shall be
adopted into the Church that they shall see, all around them, the dreadful
vengeance of God. Yet there is an implied contrast between the straits of the
calamity and the free departure; as if he had said, "Out of the dark prison in
which they had been confined they shall again come forth to the
light."</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And shall see the dead
bodies of men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He does not mean that this
slaughter shall take place in the assembly of believers; for this would greatly
diminish the happiness of the Church, in which God displays all testimonies of
joy and gladness. But as he formerly spoke of the perpetual glory by which he
shall dignify his people, so he now threatens the punishment which he shall
inflict on the reprobate, that the godly may be more careful to keep themselves
in the fear of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And their
fire shall not be extinguished.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When he says
that they shall be tormented by "fire," this mode of expression, as I have
formerly remarked, 
</font><sup><font size="2" color="Maroon">F1075</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is metaphorical. And this is clearly evident from the succeeding clause; for
worms will not be formed out of the earth to gnaw the hearts of unbelievers. The
plain meaning, therefore, is, that the wicked shall have a bad conscience as an
executioner, to torment them without end, and that torment awaits them greater
than all other torments; and finally, that they shall tremble and be agitated in
a dreadful and shocking manner, as if a worm were gnawing the heart of a man, or
a fire were consuming it, and yet thus consumed, he did not
die.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they shall be an
abhorrence to all flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Because the wicked are
now held in the highest honor, and from their lofty position look down with
contempt on good men, the Prophet threatens a shocking change; for, along with
unutterable torments, they shall also endure the deepest disgrace; as it is just
and right that they who despised and reproached the glory of God shall be loaded
with every reproach, and shall be the objects of abhorrence to angels and to the
whole world.</font><br></div>

such a sense in the original passage cannot be too strongly stated, there is no

"The literal translation is Approach to thyself;' and as this implies removal
from the speaker, the essential meaning is correctly expressed, though in a
very<i> </i>different form from the original, both by the Septuagint
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">po&gt;rjrJw ajp j

common English Version (Stand by thyself), and Henderson's improvement of it
(Keep by thyself), both suggest an idea not contained in the original, namely,
that of standing alone; whereas all that is expressed by the Hebrew phrase is
the act of standing away from the speaker, for which Lowth has found the
idiomatic equivalent (Keep to thyself.)"<i> &#8212;

"If it should please God to call the natural descendants of the patriarch in
that land, and convert them in a body to the true faith, there would be an
additional coincidence between the prophecy and the event, even in minor
circumstances, such as we often find in the history of Christ. But if no such
national restoration of the Jews to Palestine should ever happen, the extension
of the true religion over that benighted region, which both prophecy and
Providence encourage us to look for, would abundantly redeem the pledge which
God has given to his people in this and other parts of Scripture."<i> &#8212;
