24:1-67	</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>1. </b>And Abraham was old,
(and) well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all
things.	<b>1. </b>Abraham autem senex venit in dies, et Iehova benedixerat
Abraham in omnibus. 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2. </b>And Abraham said
unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I
pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: 	<b>2. </b>Et dixit Abraham ad servum suum
seniorem domus suae, qui praeerat omnibus qui erant ei, Pone nunc manum tuam sub
femore meo: 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3. </b>And I will make thee
swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt
not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I
dwell: 	<b>3. </b>Et adjurabo to per Iehovam Deum coeli, et Deum terrae, quod
non capies uxorem filio meo de filiabus Chenaanaei, in cujus medio ego habito:
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4. </b>But thou shalt go unto my country,
and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac. 	<b>4. </b>Sed ad terram
meam, et ad cognationem meam perges, et capies uxorem filio meo Ishac.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5. </b>And the servant said unto him,
Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I
needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest? 	<b>5. </b>Et
dixit ad eum servus, Si forsitan noluerit mulier venire post me ad terram hanc,
numquid reducendo reducam filium tuum ad terram unde egressus es?
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6. </b>And Abraham said unto him, Beware
thou that thou bring not my son thither again. 	<b>6. </b>Et dixit ad eum
Abraham Cave tibi ne forte reducas filium meum illuc.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>The LORD God of heaven, which took me
from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto
me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he
shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from
thence. 	<b>7. </b>Iehova Deus coeli, qui tulit me e domo patris mei, et e terra
cognationis meae, et qui loquutus est mihi, et qui juravit mihi, dicendo, Semini
tuo dabo terram hane: ipse mittet Angelum suum ante to, et capies uxorem filio
meo inde. 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b> And if the woman will not
be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only
bring not my son thither again. 	<b>8. </b>Quodsi noluerit mulier pergere post
to, mundus eris ab adjuratione mea ista: duntaxat filium meum ne reducas illuc.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9. </b>And the servant put his hand under
the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter. 	<b>9.
</b>Et posuit servus manum suam sub femore Abraham domini sui, et juravit ei
super re hac. 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10. </b>And the servant took
ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his
master <i>(were)</i> in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto
the city of Nahor. 	<b>10. </b>Et accepit servus decem camelos e camelis domini
sui, et perrexit: quia omne bonum domini sui erat in manu ejus: et surrexit, et
profectus est in Aram-naharaim, ad civitatem Nachor.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11. </b>And he made his camels to kneel
down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening,
<i>(even)</i> the time that women go out to draw (water). 	<b>11. </b>Et genu
flectere fecit camelos extra civitatem ad puteum aquae, tempore vespertino,
tempore quo egrediuntur mulieres, quae hauriunt.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12. </b>And he said, O LORD God of my
master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto
my master Abraham. 	<b>12. </b>Et dixit, Iehova Deus domini mei Abraham,
occurrere fac nunc coram me hodie, et fac misericordiam cum domino meo Abraham.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13. </b>Behold, I stand <i>(here)</i> by
the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw
water: 	<b>13. </b>Ecce, ego sto juxta fontem aquae, et filiae virorum civitatis
egrediuntur ad hauriendam aquam. 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b>And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy
pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will
give thy camels drink also: (let the same be) she <i>(that)</i> thou hast
appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed
kindness unto my master. 	<b>14. </b>Sit ergo, puella ad quam dixero, Inclina
nunc hydriam tuam, et bibam: et dixerit, Bibe, et etiam camelis tuis potum dabo:
ipsam praeparaveris servo tuo Ishac: et per hoc sciam quod feceris misericordiam
cum domino meo. 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15. </b>And it came to
pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born
to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her
pitcher upon her shoulder. 	<b>15. </b>Et fuit, antequam ipse complevisset
loqui, ecce, Ribca egrediebatur, quae nata erat Bethuel filio Milchah uxoris
Nachor fratris Abraham, et hydria ejus erat super humerum ejus.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16. </b>And the damsel <i>(was)</i> very
fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to
the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up. 	<b>16.</b> Puella autem erat
pulchra aspectu valde, virgo, et vir non cognoverat eam: quae descendit ad
fontem, et implevit hydriam suam, et ascendit.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17. </b>And the servant ran to meet her,
and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher. 	<b>17.
</b>Itaque cucurrit servus in occursum ejus, et dixit, Potum da mihi nunc parum
aquae ex hydria tua. 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18. </b>And she said,
Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave
him drink. 	<b>18. </b>Et dixit, Bibe, domine mi: et festinavit, et demisit
hydriam suam super manum suam, et potum dedit ei.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19. </b>And when she had done giving him
drink, she said, I will draw (water) for thy camels also, until they have done
drinking. 	<b>19. </b>Ubi complevit potum dare ei: tune dixit, Etiam camelis
tuis hauriam, donec compleverint bibere.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20. </b>And she hasted, and emptied her
pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw (water), and drew
for all his camels. 	<b>20. </b>Et festinavit, et effudit hydriam suam in
canale, et cucurrit adhuc ad puteum ut hauriret: et hausit omnibus camelis ejus.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21. </b>And the man wondering at her held
his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.
	<b>21. </b>Porro vir stupebat super ea tacens, ut sciret utrum secundasset
Iehova viam suam, an non. 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22. </b>And it
came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden
earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten
(shekels) weight of gold; 	<b>22. </b>Et fuit, quum complevissent cameli bibere,
protulit vir inaurem auream, semissis pondus ejus: et duas armillas, et posuit
super manus ejus: decem aurei pondus earum.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23. </b>And said, Whose daughter
<i>(art)</i> thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room <i>(in)</i> thy father's
house for us to lodge in? 	<b>23. </b>Et jam dixerat, Filia, cujus es? indica
nunc mihi, numquid est in domo patris tui locus nobis ad pernoctandum?
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24. </b>And she said unto him, I
<i>(am)</i> the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto
Nahor. 	<b>24. </b>Et dixerat ad eum, Filia Bethuel sum, filii Milchah, quem
peperit ipsa nachor. 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25. </b>She said
moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge
in. 	<b>25. </b>Et dixit ad eum, Etiam palea, etiam pabulum multum est apud nos,
etiam locus ad pernoctandum. 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26. </b>And
the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD. 	<b>26. </b>Et inclinavit
se vir, et incurvavit se Iehova. 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.
</b>And he said, Blessed <i>(be)</i> the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath
not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I (being) in the way,
the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren. 	<b>27. </b>Et dixit,
Benedictus Iehova Deus domini mei Abraham, qui non dereliquit misericordiam suam
et veritatem suam a domino meo. Ego in via, duxit me Iehova ad domum fratrum
domini mei. 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28. </b>And the damsel ran, and
told (them of) her mother's house these things. 	<b>28. </b>Et cucurrit puella,
et nuntiavit domui matris suae secundum verba haec.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29. </b>And Rebekah had a brother, and his
name <i>(was)</i> Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well. 	<b>29.
</b>Et ipsi Ribca erat frater, et nomen ejus Laban: et cucurrit Laban ad virum
foras ad fontem. 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30. </b>And it came to
pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he
heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that
he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well. 	<b>30.
</b>Fuit autem, quum vidisset inaurem et armillas in manibus sororis suae, et
quum audisset ipse verba Ribca sororis suae, dicendo, Sic loquutus est ad me
vir: venit a virum, et ecce, stabat juxta camelos, juxta fontem.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31. </b>And he said, Come in, thou blessed
of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and
room for the camels. 	<b>31. </b>Et dixit, Ingredere benedicte Iehovae, ut quid
manes foris? et ego paravi domum, et locum camelis.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>32. </b>And the man came into the house:
and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and
water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that <i>(were)</i> with him. 	<b>32.
</b>Et venit vir ad domum, et solvit camelos, et dedit paleam et pabulum
camelis, et aquam ad lavandum pedes ejus, et pedes virorum qui erant cum eo.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>33. </b>And there was set <i>(meat)</i>
before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand.
And he said, Speak on. 	<b>33. </b>Et positum est coram eo, ut comederet: et
dixit, Non comedam, donec loquutus fuero verba mea. Et dixit, Loquere.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>34. </b>And he said, I <i>(am)</i>
Abraham's servant. 	<b>34. </b>Dixit igitur, Servus Abraham sum.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>35. </b>And the LORD hath blessed my master
greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and
silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.
	<b>35. </b>Iehova autem benedixit domino meo valde, et magnificatus est, et
dedit ei pecudes et boves, et argentum, et aurum, et servos, et ancillas, et
camelos, et asinos. 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>36. </b>And Sarah my
master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he
given all that he hath. 	<b>36. </b>Et peperit Sarah uxor domini mei filium
domino meo post senectutem suam, et dedit ei omnia quae sunt ei.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>37. </b>And my master made me swear,
saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites,
in whose land I dwell: 	<b>37. </b>Et jurare fecit me dominus meus, dicendo, Non
capies uxorem filio meo de filiabus Chenaanaei, in cujus terra ego habito:
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>38. </b>But thou shalt go unto my father's
house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son. 	<b>38. </b>Sed ad domum
patris mei perges, et ad familiam meam, et capies uxorem filio meo.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>39. </b>And I said unto my master,
Peradventure the woman will not follow me. 	<b>39. </b>Et dixi domino meo,
Forsitan non perget mulier post me. 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>40.
</b>And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with
thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred,
and of my father's house: 	<b>40. </b>Et dixit ad me, Iehova, in cujus conspectu
ambulavi, mittet Angelum suum tecum, et secundabit viam tuam: et capies uxorem
filio meo de familia mea, et de domo patris mei.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>41. </b>Then shalt thou be clear from
<i>(this)</i> my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee
<i>(one)</i>, thou shalt be clear from my oath. 	<b>41. </b>Tunc mundus eris ab
adjuratione mea, si veneris ad familiam meam: et si non dederint tibi, eris
mundus ab adjuratione mea. 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>42. </b>And I
came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now
thou do prosper my way which I go: 	<b>42. </b>Veni igitur hodie ad fontem, et
dixi, Iehova Deus domini mei Abraham, si tu nunc secundas viam meam, per quam
ego ambulo: 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>43. </b>Behold, I stand by the
well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to
draw (water), and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy
pitcher to drink; 	<b>43. </b>Ecce, ego sto juxta fontem aquae: itaque sit,
virgo quae egredietur ad hauriendum, et dixero ei, Da mihi potum nunc parum
aquae ex hydria tua: 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>44. </b>And she say to
me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: <i>(let)</i> the same
<i>(be)</i> the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master's son.
	<b>44.</b> Et dixerit mihi, Etiam tu bibe, et etiam camelis tuis hauriam: ipsa
sit uxor, quam praeparavit Iehova filio domini mei.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>45. </b>And before I had done speaking in
mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she
went down unto the well, and drew (water): and I said unto her, Let me drink, I
pray thee. 	<b>45. </b>Ego antequam complerem loqui in corde meo, ecce, Ribca
egrediebatur, et hydria ejus erat super humerum ejus, et descendit ad fontem, et
hausit: et dixi ad eam, Da mihi potum nunc.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>46. </b>And she made haste, and let down
her pitcher from her (shoulder), and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels
drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also. 	<b>46. </b>Et
festinavit, et demisit hydriam suam desuper se, et dixit, Bibe, et etiam camelis
tuis potum dabo. Et bibi, et etiam camelis dedit potum.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>47. </b>And I asked her, and said, Whose
daughter <i>(art)</i> thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son,
whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the
bracelets upon her hands. 	<b>47. </b>Et interrogavi eam, et dixi, Filia cujus
es? Et dixit, Filia Bethuel filii nachor, quem peperit ei Milchah. Et posui
inaurem super nares ejus, et armillas super manus ejus.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>48. </b>And I bowed down my head, and
worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had
led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.
	<b>48 .</b>Et inclinavi me, incurvavique me Iehovae, et benedixi Iehovae Deo
domini mei Abraham, qui duxit me per viam veritatis, (vel certam fidem,) ut
acciperem filiam fratris domini mei filio ejus.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>49. </b>And now if ye will deal kindly and
truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right
hand, or to the left. 	<b>49. </b>Et nunc si facitis misericordiam et veritatem
cum domino meo, indicate mihi: et si non, indicate mihi, et vertam me ad
dexteram vel ad sinistram. 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>50. </b>Then
Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we
cannot speak unto thee bad or good. 	<b>50. </b>Et responderunt Laban et
Bethuel, et dixerunt, A Iehova egressa est res: non possumus loqui ad to malum
vel bonum. 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>51. </b>Behold, Rebekah
<i>(is)</i> before thee, take <i>(her)</i>, and go, and let her be thy master's
son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken. 	<b>51. </b>Ecce, Ribca coram to, accipe,
et vade: et sit uxor filio domini tui, quemadmodum loquutus est Iehova.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>52. </b>And it came to pass, that, when
Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, (bowing himself) to
the earth. 	<b>52. </b>Et fuit, quando audivit servus Abraham verba eorum,
incurvavit se super terram Iehovae. 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>53.
</b>And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and
raiment, and gave <i>(them)</i> to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to
her mother precious things. 	<b>53. </b>Et protulit servus vasa argentea, et
vasa aurea, et vestes, et dedit ipsi Ribcae, et pretiosa dedit fratri ejus, et
matri ejus. 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>54. </b>And they did eat and
drink, he and the men that <i>(were)</i> with him, and tarried all night; and
they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master. 	<b>54.
</b>Et comederunt, et biberunt, ipse et viri qui erant cum eo, et
pernoctaverunt: et surrexerunt mane: et dixit, Dimitte me, ut vadam ad dominum
meum. 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>55. </b>And her brother and her
mother said, Let the damsel abide with us (a few) days, at the least ten; after
that she shall go. 	<b>55. </b>Et dixit frater ejus et mater ejus, Maneat puella
nobiscum per dies, vel decem: postea ibis, (vel ibit.)
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>56. </b>And he said unto them, Hinder me
not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my
master. 	<b>56. </b>Et dixit ad eos, Ne retardetis me, quando Iehova secundavit
viam meam: dimittite me, et ibo ad dominum meum.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>57. </b>And they said, We will call the
damsel, and enquire at her mouth. 	<b>57. </b>Et dixerunt, Vocemus puellam, et
interrogemus os ejus. 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>58. </b>And they
called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I
will go. 	<b>58. </b>Et vocaverunt Ribcam, et dixerunt ad eam, Numquid ibis cum
viro isto? Et dixit, Ibo. 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>59.</b> And they
sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his
men. 	<b>59. </b>Et dimiserunt Ribcam sororem suam, et nutricem ejus, et servum
Abraham, et viros ejus. 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>60. </b>And they
blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou <i>(art)</i> our sister, be thou (the
mother) of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those
which hate them. 	<b>60. </b>Et benedixerunt Ribcae, et dixerunt ei, Soror
nostra es, sis in millia decem millium, et haereditet semen tuum portam odio
habentium illud. 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>61. </b>And Rebekah arose,
and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the
servant took Rebekah, and went his way. 	<b>61. </b>Et surrexit Ribea et puellae
ejus, et ascenderunt super camelos, et perrexerunt post virum: et tulit servus
Ribcah, et abiit. 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>62. </b>And Isaac came
from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country. 	<b>62.
</b>Ishac autem veniebat, qua venitur a Puteo viventis videntis me: et ipse
habitabat in terra Meridiana. 	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>63. </b>And
Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his
eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels <i>(were)</i> coming. 	<b>63. </b>Et
egressus erat Ishac ad orandum in agro, dum declinaret vespera: et elevavit
oculos suos, et vidit, et ecce, cameli veniebant.
	</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>64. </b>And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and
when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel. 	<b>64. </b>Tunc elevavit Ribcah

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F455</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Moses passes onwards to the relation of Isaac's marriage, because indeed
Abraham, perceiving himself to be worn down by old age, would take care that his
son should not marry a wife in the land of Canaan. In this place Moses expressly
describes Abraham as an old man, in order that we may learn that he had been
admonished, by his very age, to seek a wife for his son: for old age itself,
which, at the most, is not far distant from death, ought to induce us so to
order the affairs of our family, that when we die, peace may be preserved among
our posterity, the fear of the Lord may flourish, and rightly-constituted order
may prevail. The old age of Abraham was indeed yet green, as we shall see
hereafter; but when he reckoned up his own years he deemed it time to consult
for the welfare of his son. Irreligious men, partly because they do not hold
marriage sufficiently in honor, partly because they do not consider the
importance attached especially to the marriage of Isaac, wonder that Moses, or
rather the Spirit of God, should be employed in affairs so minute; but if we
have that reverence which is due in reading the Sacred Scriptures, we shall
easily understand that here is nothing superfluous: for inasmuch as men can
scarcely persuade themselves that the Providence of God extends to marriages, so
much the more does Moses insist on this point. He chiefly, however, wishes to
teach that God honored the family of Abraham with especial regard, because the
Church was to spring from it. But it will be better to treat of everything in
its proper order.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Abraham said unto his eldest
servant</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Abraham here fulfils the common duty
of parents, in laboring for and being solicitous about the choice of a wife for
his son: but he looks somewhat further; for since God had separated him from the
Canaanites by a sacred covenant, he justly fears lest Isaac, by joining himself
in affinity with them, should shake off the yoke of God. Some suppose that the
depraved morals of those nations were so displeasing to him, that he conceived
the marriage of his son must prove unhappy if he should take a wife from among
them. But the special reason was, as I have stated, that he would not allow his
own race to be mingled with that of the Canaanites, whom he knew to be already
divinely appointed to destruction; yea, since upon their overthrow he was to be
put into possession of the land, he was commanded to treat them with distrust as
perpetual enemies. And although he had dwelt in tranquility among them for a
time, yet he could not have a community of offspring with them without
confounding things which, by the command of God, were to be kept distinct. Hence
he wished both himself and his family to maintain this separation
entire.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Put, I pray thee, thy
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is sufficiently obvious that this was
a solemn form of swearing; but whether Abraham had first introduced it, or
whether he had received it from his fathers, is unknown. The greater part of
Jewish writers declare that Abraham was the author of it; because, in their
opinion, this ceremony is of the same force as if his servant had sworn by the
sanctity of the divine covenant, since circumcision was in that part of his
person. But Christian writers conceive that the hand was placed under the thigh
in honor of the blessed seed. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F456</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Yet it may be that these earliest fathers had something different in view; and
there are those among the Jews who assert that it was a token of subjection,
when the servant was sworn on the thigh of his master. The more plausible
opinion is, that the ancients in this manner swore by Christ; but because I do
not willingly follow uncertain conjectures, I leave the question undecided.
Nevertheless the latter supposition appears to me the more simple; namely, that
servants, when they swore fidelity to their lords, were accustomed to testify
their subjection by this ceremony, especially since they say that this practice
is still observed in certain parts of the East. That it was no profane rite,
which would detract anything from the glory of God, we infer from the fact that
the name of God is interposed. It is true that the servant placed his hand under
the thigh of Abraham, but he is adjured by God, the Creator of heaven and earth;
and this is the sacred method of adjuration, whereby God is invoked as the
witness and the judge; for this honor cannot be transferred to another without
casting a reproach upon God. Moreover, we are taught, by the example of Abraham,
that they do not sin who demand an oath for a lawful cause; for this is not
recited among the faults of Abraham, but is recorded to his peculiar praise. It
has already been shown that the affair was of the utmost importance, since it
was undertaken in order that the covenant of God might be ratified among his
posterity. He was therefore impelled, by just reasons, most anxiously to provide
for the accomplishment of his object, by taking an oath of his servant: and
beyond doubt, the disposition, and even the virtue of Isaac, were so
conspicuous, that in addition to his riches, he had such endowments of mind and
person, that many would earnestly desire affinity with him. His father,
therefore, fears lest, after his own death, the inhabitants of the land should
captivate Isaac by their allurements. Now, though Isaac has hitherto steadfastly
resisted those allurements, the snares of which few young men escape, Abraham
still fears lest, by shame and the dread of giving offense, he may be overcome.
The holy man wished to anticipate these and similar dangers, when he bound his
servant to fidelity, by interposing an oath; and it may be that some secret
necessity also impelled him to take this
course.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That thou shalt not take a
wife</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The kind of discipline which prevailed in
Abraham's house is here apparent. Although this man was but a servant, yet,
because he was put in authority by the master of the family, his servile
condition did not prevent him from being next in authority to his lord; so that
Isaac himself, the heir and successor of Abraham, submitted to his direction. To
such an extent did the authority of Abraham and reverence for him prevail, that
when he substituted a servant in his place, he caused this servant, by his mere
will or word, to exercise a power which other masters of families find it
difficult to retain for themselves. The modesty also of Isaac, who suffered
himself to be governed by a servant, is obvious; for it would have been in vain
for Abraham to enter into engagements with his servant, had he not been
persuaded that his son would prove submissive and tractable. It here appears
what great veneration he cherished towards his father; because Abraham, relying
on Isaac's obedience, confidently calls his servant to him. Now this example
should be taken by us as a common rule, to show that it is not lawful for the
children of a family to contract marriage, except with the consent of parents;
and certainly natural equity dictates that, in a matter of such importance,
children should depend upon the will of their parents. How detestable,
therefore, is the barbarity of the Pope, who has dared to burst this sacred bond
asunder! Wherefore the wantonness of youths is to be restrained, that they may
not rashly contract nuptials without consulting their
fathers.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But thou shalt go unto my country
and to my kindred</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It seems that, in the choice
of the place, Abraham was influenced by the thought, that a wife would more
willingly come from thence to be married to his son, when she knew that she was
to marry one of her own race and country. But because it afterwards follows that
the servant came to Padan Aram, some hence infer that Mesopotamia was Abraham's
country. The solution, however, of this difficulty is easy. We know that
Mesopotamia was not only the region contained between the Tigris and the
Euphrates, but that a part also of Chaldea was comprehended in it; for Babylon
is often placed there by profane writers. The Hebrew name simply means, "Syria
of the rivers." They give the name Aram to that part of Syria which, beginning
near Judea, embraces Armenia and other extensive regions, and reaches almost to
the Euxine Sea. But when they especially designate those lands which are washed
or traversed by the Tigris and Euphrates, they add the name "Padan:" for we know
that Moses did not speak scientifically, but in a popular style. Since, however,
he afterwards relates that Laban, the son of Nahor, dwelt at Charran,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012904&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
29:4,) it seems to me probable that Nahor, who had remained in Chaldea, because
it would be troublesome to leave his native soil, in process of time changed his
mind; either because filial piety constrained him to attend to his decrepit and
declining father, or because he had learned that he might have there a home as
commodious as in his own country. It certainly appears from the eleventh chapter
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
11:1 that he had not migrated at the same time with his father. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F457</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the servant said unto
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Since he raises no objection respecting
Isaac, we may conjecture that he was so fully persuaded of his integrity as to
have no doubt of his acquiescence in his father's will. We must also admire the
religious scrupulosity of the man, seeing he does not rashly take an oath. What
pertained to the faithful and diligent discharge of his own duty he might
lawfully promise, under the sanction of an oath; but since the completion of the
affair depended on the will of others, he properly and wisely adduces this
exception, "Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow
me."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Beware that thou bring not my son
thither again</i></font><font face="Palatino">. If the woman should not be found
willing, Abraham, commending the event to God, firmly adheres to the principal
point, that his son Isaac should not return to his country, because in this
manner he would have deprived himself of the promised inheritance. He therefore
chooses rather to live by hope, as a stranger, in the land of Canaan, than to
rest among his relatives in his native soil: and thus we see that, in perplexed
and confused affairs, the mind of the holy man was not drawn aside from the
command of God by any agitating cares; and we are taught, by his example, to
follow God through every obstacle. However, he afterwards declares that he looks
for better things. By such words he confirms the confidence of his servant, so
that he, anticipating with greater alacrity a prosperous issue, might prepare
for the journey.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord God of
heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By a twofold argument Abraham infers,
that what he is deliberating respecting the marriage of his son will, by the
grace of God, have a prosperous issue. First, because God had not led him forth
in vain from his own country into a foreign land; and secondly, because God had
not falsely promised to give the land, in which he was dwelling as a stranger,
to his seed. He might also with propriety be confident that his design should
succeed, because he had undertaken it only by the authority, and, as it were,
under the auspices of God; for it was his exclusive regard for God which turned
away his mind from the daughters of Canaan. He may, however, be thought to have
inferred without reason that God would give his son a wife from that country and
kindred to which he himself had bidden farewell. But whereas he had left his
relatives only at the divine command, he hopes that God will incline their minds
to be propitious and favorable to him. Meanwhile he concludes, from the past
kindnesses of God, that his hand would not fail him in the present business; as
if he would say, "I, who at the command of God left my country, and have
experienced his continued help in my pilgrimage, do not doubt that he will also
be the guide of thy journey, because it is in reliance on his promise that I lay
upon thee this injunction." He then describes the mode in which assistance would
be granted; namely, that God would send his angel, for he knew that God helps
his servants by the ministration of angels, of which he had already received
many proofs. By calling God the God of heaven, he celebrates that divine power
which was the ground of his confidence.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the servant took ten
camels.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He takes the camels with him, to prove
that Abraham is a man of great wealth, in order that he may the more easily
obtain what he desires. For even an open-hearted girl would not easily suffer
herself to be drawn away to a distant region, unless on the proposed condition
of being supplied with the conveniences of life. Exile itself is sad enough,
without poverty as its attendant. Therefore, that the maid might not be deterred
by the apprehension of want, but rather invited by the prospect of affluence, he
ladens ten camels with presents, to give sufficient proof to the inhabitants of
Chaldea of the domestic opulence of Abraham. What follows, namely, that "all the
substance of Abraham was in the hand of his servant," some of the Hebrews
improperly explain as meaning that the servant took with him an account of all
Abraham's wealth, described and attested in written documents. It is rather the
assigning of the reason of the fact, which might appear improbable, that the
servant assumed so much power to himself. Therefore Moses, having said that a
man who was but a servant set out on a journey with such a sumptuous and
splendid equipage, immediately adds, that he did this of his own accord, because
he had all the substance of Abraham in his hand. In saying that he came to the
city of Nahor, he neither mentions the name of the city nor the part of Chaldea,
or of any other region, where he dwelt, but only says, in general terms, that he
came to "Syria of the rivers," concerning which term I have said something
above.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O lord God of my master
Abraham</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The servant, being destitute of
counsel, retakes himself to prayers. Yet he does not simply ask counsel of the
Lord; but he also prays that the maid appointed to be the wife of Isaac should
be brought to him with a certain sign, from which he might gather that she was
divinely presented to him. It is an evidence of his piety and faith, that in a
matter of such perplexity he is not bewildered, as one astonished; but breaks
forth into prayer with a collected mind. But the method which he uses 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F458</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
seems scarcely consistent with the true rule of prayer. For, first, we know that
no one prays aright unless he subjects his own wishes to God. Wherefore there is
nothing more unsuitable than to prescribe anything, at our own will, to God.
Where, then, it may be asked, is the religion of the servant, who, according to
his own pleasure, imposes a law upon God? Secondly, there ought to be nothing
ambiguous in our prayers; and absolute certainty is to be sought for only in the
Word of God. Now, since the servant prescribes to God what answer shall be
given, he appears culpably to depart from the suitable modesty of prayer; for
although no promise had been given him, he nevertheless desires to be made fully
certain respecting the whole affair. God, however, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F459</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in hearkening to his wish, proves, by the event, that it was acceptable to
himself. Therefore we must know, that although a special promise had not been
made at the moment, yet the servant was not praying rashly, nor according to the
lust of the flesh, but by the secret impulse of the Spirit. Moreover, the
general law, by which all the pious are bound, does not prevent the Lord, when
he determines to give something extraordinary, from directing the minds of his
servants towards it; not that he would lead them away from his word, but only
that he makes some peculiar concession to them in their mode of praying. The sum
of the prayer before us is this: "O Lord, if a damsel shall present herself who,
being asked to give me drink, shall also kindly and courteously offer it to my
camels, I will seek after her as a wife for my master Isaac, just as if she were
delivered into my hand by thee." He seems, indeed, to be laying hold on some
dubious conjecture; but since he reposes on the Providence of God, he is
certainly persuaded that this token shall be to him equivalent to an oracle;
because God, who is the guardian of his enterprise, will not suffer him to err.
Meanwhile this is worthy of remark, that he does not fetch the sign of
recognition from afar, but takes it from something present; for she who shall be
thus humane to an unknown guest, will, by that very act, give proof of an
excellent disposition. This observation may be of use to prevent inquisitive men
from adducing this example as a precedent for vain prognostications. In the
words themselves the following particulars are to be noticed: first, that he
addresses himself to the God of his master Abraham; not as being himself a
stranger to the worship of God, but because the affair in question depends upon
the promise given to Abraham. And truly he had no confidence in prayer, from any
other source than from the covenant into which God had entered with the house of
Abraham. The expression "cause to meet me this day," 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F460</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Jerome renders, "meet me, I pray, this day". But the verb is transitive, and the
servant of Abraham intimates by the use of it, that the affairs of men were so
ordered by the counsel and the hand of God, that the issue of them was not
fortuitous; as if he would say, O Lord, in vain shall I look on this side and on
that; in vain shall I catch at success by my own labor, industry and various
contrivances, unless thou direct the work. And when he immediately afterwards
subjoins, show kindness to my master, he implies that in this undertaking he
rests upon nothing but the grace which God had promised to
Abraham.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Before he had done
speaking</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The sequel sufficiently demonstrates
that his wish had not been foolish)y conceived. For the quickness of the answer
manifests the extraordinary indulgence of God, who does not suffer the man to be
long harassed with anxiety. Rebekah had, indeed, left her house before he began
to pray; but it must be maintained that the Lord, at whose disposal are both the
moments of time and the ways of man, had so ordered it on both sides as to give
clear manifestation of his Providence. For sometimes he keeps us the longer in
suspense, till, wearied with praying, we may seem to have lost our labor; but in
this affair, in order that his blessing might not seem doubtful, he suddenly
interposed. The same thing also happened to Daniel, unto whom the angel
appeared, before the conclusion of his prayer.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;270921&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
9:21.) Now, although it frequently happens that, on account of our sloth, the
Lord delays to grant our requests, it is, at such times, expedient for us, that
what we ask should be delayed. In the meantime, he has openly and conspicuously
proved, by unquestionable examples, that although the event may not immediately
respond to our wishes, the prayers of his people are never in vain: yea, his own
declaration, that before they cry he is mindful of their wants, is invariably
fulfilled.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;236524&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
65:24.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the man, wondering at
her, held his peace</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This wondering of
Abraham's servant, shows that he had some doubt in his mind. He is silently
inquiring within himself, whether God would render his journey prosperous. Has
he, then, no confidence concerning that divine direction, of which he had
received the sign or pledge? I answer, that faith is never so absolutely perfect
in the saints as to prevent the occurrence of many doubts. There is, therefore,
no absurdity in supposing that the servant of Abraham, though committing himself
generally to the providence of God, yet wavers, and is agitated, amidst a
multiplicity of conflicting thoughts. Again, faith, although it pacifies and
calms the minds of the pious, so that they patiently wait for God, still does
not exonerate them from all care; because it is necessary that patience itself
should be exercised, by anxious expectation, until the Lord fulfill what he has
promised. But though this hesitation of Abraham's servant was not free from
fault, inasmuch as it flowed from infirmity of faith; it is vet, on this
account, excusable, because he did not turn his eyes in another direction, but
only sought from the event a confirmation of his faith, that he might perceive
God to be present with him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The man took a golden
ear-ring</i></font><font face="Palatino">. His adorning the damsel with precious
ornaments is a token of his confidence. For since it is evident by many proofs
that he was an honest and careful servant, he would not throw away without
discretion the treasures of his master. He knows, therefore, that these gifts
will not be ill-bestowed; or, at least, relying on the goodness of God, he gives
them, in faith, as an earnest of future marriage. But it may be asked, Whether
God approves ornaments of this kind, which pertain not so much to neatness as to
pomp? I answer, that the things related in Scripture are not always proper to be
imitated. Whatever the Lord commands in general terms is to be accounted as an
inflexible rule of conduct; but to rely on particular examples is not only
dangerous, but even foolish and absurd. Now we know how highly displeasing to
God is not only pomp and ambition in adorning the body, but all kind of luxury.
In order to free the heart from inward cupidity, he condemns that immoderate and
superfluous splendor, which contains within itself many allurements to vice.
Where, indeed, is pure sincerity of heart found under splendid ornaments?
Certainly all acknowledge this virtue to be rare. It is not, however, for us
expressly to forbid every kind of ornament; yet because whatever exceeds the
frugal use of such things is tarnished with some degree of vanity; and more
especially, because the cupidity of women is, on this point, insatiable; not
only must moderation, but even abstinence, be cultivated as far as possible.
Further, ambition silently creeps in, so that the somewhat excessive adorning of
the person soon breaks out into disorder. With respect to the earrings and
bracelets of Rebekah, as I do not doubt that they were those in use among the
rich, so the uprightness of the age allowed them to be sparingly and frugally
used; and yet I do not excuse the fault. This example, however, neither helps
us, nor alleviates our guilt, if, by such means, we excite and continually
inflame those depraved lusts which, even when all incentives are removed, it is
excessively difficult to restrain. The women who desire to shine in gold, seek
in Rebekah a pretext for their corruption. Why, therefore, do they not, in like
manner, conform to the same austere kind of life and rustic labor to which she
applied herself? But, as I have just said, they are deceived who imagine that
the examples of the saints can sanction them in opposition to the common law of
God. Should any one object that it is abhorrent to the modesty of a virtuous and
chaste maiden to receive earrings and bracelets from a man who was a stranger,
and whom she had never before seen. In the first place, it may be, that Moses
passes over much conversation held on both sides, by which it is probable she
was induced to venture on the reception of them. It may also be, that he relates
first what was last in order. For it follows soon afterwards in the context,
that the servant of Abraham inquired whose daughter she was. We must also take
into account the simplicity of that age. Whence does it arise that it was not
disreputable for a maid to go alone out of the city, unless that then the morals
of mankind did not require so severe a guard for the preservation of modesty?
Indeed, it appears from the context, that the ornaments were not given her for a
dishonorable purpose; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F461</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but a portions is offered to the parents to facilitate the contract for
marriage. Interpreters are not agreed respecting the value of the presents.
Moses estimates the earrings at half a shekel, and the bracelets at ten shekels.
Jerome, instead of half a shekel, reads two shekels. I conceive the genuine
sense to be, that the bracelets were worth ten shekels, and the frontal ornament
or earrings worth half that sum, or five shekels. For since nothing is added
after the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[qb</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>bekah</i>,) it has reference to the greater number. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F462</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Otherwise here is no suitable proportion between the bracelets and the ornaments
for the head. Moreover, if we take the shekel for four Attic drachms, the value
is trifling; therefore I think the weight of gold is indicated, which makes the
sum much greater than the piece of money called a
shekel.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the man bowed down his
head</i></font><font face="Palatino">. When the servant of Abraham hears that he
had alighted upon the daughter of Bethel, he is more and more elated with hope.
Yet he does not exult, as profane men are wont to do, as if the occurrence were
fortuitous; but he gives thanks to God, regarding it, as the result of
Providence, that he had been thus opportunely led straight to the place he had
wished. He does not, therefore, boast of his good fortune; but he declares that
God had dealt kindly and faithfully with Abraham; or, in other words, that, for
his own mercy's sake, God had been faithful in fulfilling his promises. It is
true that the same form of speech is applied to the persons present; just as it
follows soon after in the same chapter,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012449&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis

and truly with my master tell me."</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The language is, however, peculiarly suitable to the
character of God, both because he gratuitously confers favors upon men, and is
specially inclined to beneficence: and also, by never frustrating their hope, he
proves himself to be faithful and true. This thanksgiving, therefore, teaches us
always to have the providence of God before our eyes, in order that we may
ascribe to him whatever happens prosperously to
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.

that the mother of Rebekah occupied a separate house; not that she had a family
divided from that of her husband, but for the purpose of keeping her daughters
and maidens under her own custody. The expression may, however, be more simply
explained to mean, that she came directly to her mother's chamber; because she
could more easily relate the matter to her than to her father. It is also
probable, that when Bethuel was informed of the fact, by the relation of his

Moses begins to show by what means the parents of Rebekah were induced to give
her in marriage to their nephew. That the servant, when food was set before him,
should refuse to eat till he had completed his work is a proof of his diligence
and fidelity; and it may with propriety be regarded as one of the benefits which
God had vouchsafed to Abraham, that he should have a servant so faithful, and so
intent upon his duty. Since, however, this was the reward of the holy discipline
which Abraham maintained, we cannot wonder that very few such servants are to be
found, seeing that everywhere they are so
ill-governed.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moreover, although the servant
seems to weave a superfluous story, yet there is nothing in it which is not
available to his immediate purpose. He knew that it was a feeling naturally
inherent in parents, not willingly to send away their children to a distance. He
therefore first commemorates Abraham's riches, that they might not hesitate to
connect their daughter with a husband so wealthy. He secondly explains that
Isaac was born of his mother in her old age; not merely for the purpose of
informing them that he had been miraculously given to his father, whence they
might infer that he had been divinely appointed to this greatness and eminence;
but that an additional commendation might be given on account of Isaac's age. In
the third place, he affirms that Isaac would be the sole heir of his father.
Fourthly, he relates that he had been bound by an oath to seek a wife for his
master Isaac, from among his own kindred; which special choice on the part of
Abraham was very effectual in moving them to compliance. Fifthly, he states that
Abraham, in full confidence that God would be the leader of his journey, had
committed the whole business to him. Sixthly, he declares, that whatever he had
asked in prayer he had obtained from the Lord; whence it appeared that the
marriage of which he was about to treat was according to the will of God. We now
see the design of his narration: First, to persuade the parents of Rebekah that
he had not been sent for the purpose of deceiving them, that he had not in
anything acted craftily, or by oblique methods, but in the fear of the Lord, as
the religious obligation of marriage requires. Secondly, that he was desiring
nothing which would not be profitable and honorable for them. And lastly, that
God had been the director of the whole
affair.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moreover, since the servant of Abraham,
though persuaded that the angel of God would be the guide of his journey, yet
neither directs his prayers nor his thanksgivings to him, we may hence learn
that angels are not, in such a sense, constituted the ministers of God to us, as
that they should be invoked by us, or should transfer to themselves the worship
due to God; a superstition which prevails nearly over the whole world to such a
degree, that men turn aside a portion of their faith from the only fountain of
all good to the rivulets which flow from it. The clause, the <i>Lord, before
whom I walk</i>,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011604&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
16:40,) which some refer to the probity and good conscience of Abraham, I rather
explain as applying to the faith, by which he set God before him, as the
governor of his life, being confident that he was the object of God's care, and
dependent upon his grace.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If
ye will deal kindly</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F464</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
I have lately related the force of this expression; namely, to act with humanity
and good faith. He thus modestly and suppliantly asks them to consent to the
marriage of Isaac and Rebekah: should he meet with a repulse from them, he says,
he will go either to the right hand or to the left; that is, he will look around
elsewhere. For he places the right hand and the left in contrast with the
straight way in which he had been led to them. It is, however, with fertile
ingenuity that some of the Hebrews explain the words as meaning, that he would
go to Lot, or to Ishmael.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>50.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The thing proceedeth from the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Whereas they are convinced by the
discourse of the man, that God was the Author of this marriage, they avow that
it would be unlawful for them to offer anything in the way of contradiction.
They declare that the thing proceedeth from the Lord; because he had, by the
clearest signs, made his will manifest. Hence we perceive, that although the
true religion was in part observed among them, and in part infected with vicious
errors, yet the fear of God was never so utterly extinguished, but this axiom
remained firmly fixed in all their minds, that God must be obeyed. If, then,
wretched idolaters, who had almost fallen away from religion, nevertheless so
subjected themselves to God, as to acknowledge it to be unlawful for them to
swerve from his will, how much more prompt ought our obedience to be? Therefore,
as soon as the will of God is made known to us, not only let our tongues be
silent, but let all our senses be still; because it is an audacious profanation
to admit any thought which is opposed to that
will.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>52.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He
worshipped</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses again repeats that Abraham's
servant gave thanks to God; and it is not without reason that he so often
inculcates this religious duty; because, since God requires nothing greater from
us, the neglect of it betrays the most shameful indolence. The acknowledgment of
God's kindness is a sacrifice of sweet-smelling savor; yea, it is a more
acceptable service than all sacrifices. God is continually heaping innumerable
benefits upon men. Their ingratitude, therefore, is intolerable, if they fail to
exercise themselves in celebrating those
benefits.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>54.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they rose up in the
morning</i></font><font face="Palatino">. On this point Moses insists the more
particularly; partly, for the purpose of commending the faithful industry of the
servant in fulfilling his master's commands; partly, for that of teaching, that
his mind was inflamed by the Spirit of God, for he is so ardent as to allow no
truce to others, and no relaxation to himself. Thus, although he conducted
himself as became an honest and prudent servant, it is still not to be doubted
that the Lord impelled him, for Isaac's sake, to act as he did. So the Lord
watches over his own people while they sleep, expedites and accomplishes their
affairs in their absence, and influences the dispositions of all, so far as is
expedient, to render them assistance. It is by a forced interpretation, that
some would explain the ten days, during which Laban and his mother desire the
departure of Rebekah to be deferred, as meaning years or months. For it was
merely the tender wish of the mother, who could ill bear that her daughter
should thus suddenly be torn away from her
bosom.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>57.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We will call the
damsel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Bethuel, who had before unreservedly
given his daughter in marriage, now seems to adhere, with but little constancy,
to his purpose. When, however, he had previously offered his daughter, without
making any exception, he is to be understood as having done it, only so far as
he was able. But now, Moses declares that he did not exercise tyranny over his
daughter, so as to thrust her out reluctantly, or to compel her to marry against
her will, but left her to her own free choice. Truly, in this matter, the
authority of parents ought to be sacred: but a middle course is to be pursued,
so that the parties concerned may make their contract spontaneously, and with
mutual consent. It is not right to understand that Rebekah in answering so
explicitly, showed contempt for the paternal roof, or too anxiously desired a
husband; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F465</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but since she saw that the affair was transacted by the authority of her father,
and with the consent of her mother, she also herself acquiesced in
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>59.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they sent away
Rebekah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses first relates, that Rebekah was
honorably dismissed; because her nurse was given unto her. Moreover, I doubt not
that they had domestic nurses, who were their handmaidens; not that mothers
entirely neglected that duty, but that they committed the care of education to
one particular maid. They therefore who assisted mothers with subsidiary service
were called nurses. Moses afterwards adds, that Rebekah's relatives "blessed
her",
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012460&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
24:60,) by which expression he means, that they prayed that her condition might
be a happy one. We know that it was a solemn custom, in all ages, and among all
people, to accompany marriages with all good wishes. And although posterity has
greatly degenerated from the pure and genuine method of celebrating marriages
used by the fathers; yet it is God's will that some public testimony should
stand forth, by which men may be admonished, that no nuptials are lawful, except
those which are rightly consecrated. Now, the particular form of benediction
which is here related, was probably in common use, because nature dictates that
the propagation of offspring is the special end of marriage. Under the notion of
victory
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012460&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
24:60) is comprehended a prosperous state of life. The Lord, however, directed
their tongues to utter a prophecy of which they themselves were ignorant. To
possess the gates of enemies, means to obtain dominion over them; because
judgment was administered in the gates, and the bulwarks of the city were placed
there.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>63.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Isaac went
out</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It appears that Isaac dwelt apart from his
father; either because the family was too large, or because such was the custom.
And perhaps Abraham had already married another wife; so that, for the sake of
avoiding contentions, it would seem more convenient for him to have a house of
his own. Thus great wealth has its attendant troubles. Doubtless, of all earthly
blessings granted by God, none would have been sweeter to Abraham than that of
living with his son. However, I by no means think that he was deprived of his
society and assistance. For such was the piety of Isaac, that he undoubtedly
studied to discharge every duty towards his father: this alone was wanting, that
they did not live in the same house. Moses also relates how it happened that
Isaac met with his wife before she reached his home. For he says, that Isaac
went out in the evening to <i>meditate</i> or to <i>pray</i>. For the Hebrew
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jw&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>soach</i>) may mean either. It is probable that he did this according to his
custom, and that he sought a place of retirement for prayer, in order that his
mind, being released from all avocations, might be the more at liberty to serve
God. Whether, however, he was giving his mind to meditation or to prayer, the
Lord granted him a token of his own presence in that joyful
meeting.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>64.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Rebekah lifted up her
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We may easily conjecture that Isaac, when
he saw the camels, turned his steps towards them, from the desire of seeing his
bride; this gave occasion to the inquiry of Rebekah. Having received the answer,
she immediately, for the sake of doing honor to her husband, dismounted her
camel to salute him. For that she fell, struck with fear, as some suppose, in no
way agrees with the narrative. She had performed too long a journey, under the
protection of many attendants, to be so greatly afraid at the sight of one man.
But these interpreters are deceived, because they do not perceive, that in the
words of Moses, the reason is afterwards given to this effect, that when Rebekah
saw Isaac, she alighted from her camel; because she had inquired of the servant
who he was, and had been told that he was the son of his master Abraham. It
would not have entered into her mind to make such inquiry respecting any person
whom she might accidentally meet: but seeing she had been informed that
Abraham's house was not far distant, she supposes him at least to be one of the
domestics. Moses also says that she took a veil: which was a token of shame and
modesty. For hence also, the Latin word which signifies "to marry," 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F466</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is derived, because it was the custom to give brides veiled to their husbands.
That the same rite was also observed by the fathers, I have no doubt. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F467</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
So much the more shameful, and the less capable of excuse, is the licentiousness
of our own age; in which the apparel of brides seems to be purposely contrived
for the subversion of all modesty.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>67.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Isaac brought her into
his mother Sarah's tent</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He first brought her
into the tent, then took her as his wife. By the very arrangement of his words,
Moses distinguishes between the legitimate mode of marriage and barbarism. And
certainly the sanctity of marriage demands that man and woman should not live
together like cattle; but that, having pledged their mutual faith, and invoked
the name of God, they might dwell with each other. Besides, it is to be
observed, that Isaac was not compelled, by the tyrannical command of his father,
to marry; but after he had given his mind to her he took her freely, and
cordially gave her the assurance of conjugal
fidelity.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Isaac was
comforted after his mother's death</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Since his
grief for the death of his mother was now first assuaged, we infer how great had
been its vehemence; for a period sufficiently long had already elapsed. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F468</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
We may also hence infer, that the affection of Isaac was tender and gentle: and
that his love to his mother was of no common kind, seeing he had so long
lamented her death. And the knowledge of this fact is useful to prevent us from
imagining that the holy patriarchs were men of savage manners and of iron
hardness of heart, and from becoming like those who conceive fortitude to
consist in brutality. Only care must be taken that grief should be duly
mitigated; lest it burst forth in impious murmurings, or subvert the hope of a
future resurrection. I do not however entirely excuse the sorrow of Isaac; I
only advise, that what belongs to humanity, ought not to be altogether
condemned. And although it was culpable not to be able to efface grief from the
mind, until the opposite joy of marriage prevailed over it; Moses still reckons
it among the benefits conferred by God, that he applies a remedy of any kind to
his servant.</font><br></div>

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F469</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It seems very absurd that Abraham, who is said to have been dead in his own body
thirty-eight years before the decease of Sarah, should, after her death, marry
another wife. such an act was, certainly, unworthy of his gravity. Besides, when
Paul commends his faith,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450419&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
4:19,) he not only asserts that the womb of Sarah was dead, when Isaac was about
to be born, but also that the body of the father himself was dead. Therefore
Abraham acted most foolishly, if, after the loss of his wife, he, in the
decrepitude of old age, contracted another marriage. Further, it is at variance
with the language of Paul, that he, who in his hundredth year was cold and
impotent, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F470</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
should, forty years afterwards, have many sons. Many commentators, to avoid this
absurdity, suppose Keturah to have been the same person as Hagar. But their
conjecture is immediately refuted in the context; where Moses says, Abraham gave
gifts to the sons of his concubines. The same point is clear)y established from

Chronicles 1:32. Others conjecture that, while Sarah was yet living, he took
another wife. This, although worthy of grave censure, is however not altogether
incredible. We know it to be not uncommon for men to be rendered bold by
excessive license. Thus Abraham having once transgressed the law of marriage,
perhaps, after the dispute respecting Hagar, did not desist from the practice of
polygamy. It is also probable that his mind had been wounded, by the divorce
which Sarah had compelled him to make with Hagar. Such conduct indeed was
disgraceful, or, at least, unbecoming in the holy patriarch. Nevertheless no
other, of all the conjectures which have been made, seems to me more probable.
If it be admitted, the narrative belongs to another place; but Moses is
frequently accustomed to place those things which have precedence in time, in a
different order. And though this reason should not be deemed conclusive, yet the
fact itself shows an inverted order in the history. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F471</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Sarah had passed her ninetieth year, when she brought forth her son Isaac; she
died in the hundred and twenty-seventh year of her age; and Isaac married when
he was forty years old. Therefore, nearly four years intervened between the
death of his mother and his nuptials. If Abraham took a wife after this, what
was he thinking of, seeing that he had been during so many years accustomed to a
single life? It is therefore lawful to conjecture that Moses, in writing the
life of Abraham, when he approached the closing scene, inserted what he had
before omitted. The difficulty, however, is not yet solved. For whence proceeded
Abraham's renovated vigor, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F472</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
since Paul testifies that his body had long ago been withered by age? Augustine
supposes not only that strength was imparted to him for a short space of time,
which might suffice for Isaac's birth; but that by a divine restoration, it
flourished again during the remaining term of his life. Which opinion, both
because it amplifies the glory of the miracle, and for other reasons, I
willingly embrace. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F473</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And what I have before said, namely, that Isaac was miraculously born, as being
a spiritual seed, is not opposed to this view; for it was especially on his
account that the failing body of Abraham was restored to vigor. That others were
afterwards born was, so to speak, adventitious. Thus the blessing of God
pronounced in the words, "Increase and multiply," which was annexed expressly to
marriage, is also extended to unlawful connexions. Certainly, if Abraham married
a wife while Sarah was yet alive, (as I think most probable,) his adulterous
connection was unworthy of the divine benediction. But although we know not why
this addition was made to the just measure of favor granted to Abraham, yet the
wonderful providence of God appears in this, that while many nations of
considerable importance descended from his other sons, the spiritual covenant,
of which the rest also bore the sign in their flesh, remained in the exclusive
possession of Isaac.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But unto the sons of the
concubines</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses relates, that when Abraham
was about to die, he formed the design of removing all cause of strife among his
sons after his death, by constituting Isaac his sole heir, and dismissing the
rest with suitable gifts. This dismissal was, indeed, apparently harsh and
cruel; but it was agreeable to the appointment and decree of God, in order that
the entire possession of the land might remain for the posterity of Isaac. For
it was not lawful for Abraham to divide, at his own pleasure, that inheritance
which had been granted entire to Isaac. Wherefore, no course was left to him but
to provide for the rest of his sons in the manner here described. If any person
should now select one of his sons as his heir, to the exclusion of the others,
he would do them an injury; and, by applying the torch of injustice, in
disinheriting a part of his children, he would light up the flame of pernicious
strifes in his family. Wherefore, we must note the special reason by which
Abraham was not only induced, but compelled, to deprive his sons of the
inheritance, and to remove them to a distance; namely, lest by their
intervention, the grant which had been divinely made to Isaac should, of
necessity, be disturbed. We have elsewhere said that, among the Hebrews, she who
is a partaker of the bed, but not of all the goods, is styled a concubine. The
same distinction has been adopted into the customs, and sanctioned by the laws
of all nations. So, we shall afterwards see, that Leah and Rachel were principal
wives, but that Bilhah and Zilpah were in the second rank; so that their
condition remained servile, although they were admitted to the conjugal bed.
Since Abraham had made Hagar and Keturah his wives on this condition, it seems
that he might lawfully bestow on their sons, only a small portion of his goods;
to have transferred, however, from his only heir to them, equal portions of his
property, would have been neither just nor right. It is probable that no
subsequent strife or contention took place respecting the succession; but by
sending the sons of the concubines far away, he provides against the danger of
which I have spoken, lest they should occupy a part of the land which God had
assigned to the posterity of Isaac
alone.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And these are the
days</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses now brings us down to the death of
Abraham; and the first thing to be noticed concerning his age is the number of
years during which he lived as a pilgrim; for he deserves the praise of
wonderful and incomparable patience, for having wandered through the space of a
hundred years, while God led him about in various directions, contented, both in
life and death, with the bare promise of God. Let those be ashamed who find it
difficult to bear the disquietude of one, or of a few years, since Abraham, the
father of the faithful, was not merely a stranger during a hundred years, but
was also often cast forth into exile. Meanwhile, however, Moses expressly shows
that the Lord had fulfilled his promise, Thou shalt die in a good old age: for
although he fought a hard and severe battle, yet his consolation was neither
light nor small; because he knew that, amidst so many sufferings, his life was
the object of Divine care. But if this sole looking unto God sustained him
through his whole life, amidst the most boisterous waves, amidst many bitter
griefs, amidst tormenting cares, and in short an accumulated mass of evils; let
us also learn &#8212; that we may not become weary in our course &#8212; to rely
on this support, that the Lord has promised us a happy issue of life, and one
truly far more glorious than that of our father
Abraham.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then Abraham gave up the
ghost</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F474</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
They are mistaken who suppose that this expression denotes sudden death, as
intimating that he had not been worn out by long disease, but expired without
pain. Moses rather means to say that the father of the faithful was not exempt
from the common lot of men, in order that our minds may not languish when the
outward man is perishing; but that, by meditating on that renovation which is
laid up as the object of our hope, we may, with tranquil minds, suffer this
frail tabernacle to be dissolved. There is therefore no reason why a feeble,
emaciated body, failing eyes, tremulous hands, and the lost use of all our
members, should so dishearten us, that we should not hasten, after the example
of our father, with joy and alacrity to our death. But although Abraham had this
in common with the human race, that he grew old and died; yet Moses, shortly
afterwards, puts a difference between him and the promiscuous multitude of men
as to manner of dying; namely, that he should die in a good old age, and
satisfied with life. Unbelievers, indeed, often seem to participate in the same
blessing; yea, David complains that they excelled in this kind of privilege; and
a similar complaint occurs in the book of Job, namely, that they fill up their
time happily, till in a moment they descend into the grave. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F475</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But what I said before must be remembered, that the chief part of a good old age
consists in a good conscience and in a serene and tranquil mind. Whence it
follows, that what God promises to Abraham, can only apply to those who truly
cultivate righteousness: for Plato says, with equal truth and wisdom, that a
good hope is the nutriment of old age; and therefore old men who have a guilty
conscience are miserably tormented, and are inwardly racked as by a perpetual
torture. But to this we must add, what Plato knew not, that it is godliness
which causes a good old age to attend us even to the grave, because faith is the
preserver of a tranquil mind. To the same point belongs what is immediately
added, he was full of days, so that he did not desire a prolongation of life. We
see how many are in bondage to the desire of life; yea, nearly the whole world
languishes between a weariness of the present life and an inexplicable desire
for its continuance. That satiety of life, therefore, which shall cause us to be
ready to leave it, is a singular favor from
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And was gathered to his
people</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I gladly embrace the opinion of those
who believe the state of our future life to be pointed out in this form of
expression; provided we do not restrict it, as these expositors do, to the
faithful only; but understand by it that mankind are associated together in
<i>death</i> as well as in life. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F476</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It may seem absurd to profane men, for David to say, that the reprobate are
gathered together like sheep into the grave; but if we examine the expression
more closely, this gathering together will have no existence if their souls are
annihilated. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F477</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The mention of Abraham's burial will presently follow. Now he is said to be
gathered to his fathers, which would be inconsistent with fact if human life
vanished, and men were reduced to annihilation: wherefore the Scripture, in
speaking thus, shows that another state of life remains after death, so that a
departure out of the world is not the destruction of the whole
man.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And his sons Isaac and Ishmael
buried him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Hence it appears, that although
Ishmael had long ago been dismissed, he was not utterly alienated from his
father, because he performed the office of a son in celebrating the obsequies of
his deceased parent. Ishmael, rather than the other sons did this, as being
nearer.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now these are the generations
of Ishmael</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This narration is not superfluous.
In the commencement of the chapter, Moses alludes to what was done for the sons
of Keturah. Here he speaks designedly more at large, for the purpose of showing
that the promise of God, given in the seventeenth chapter
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
17:1,) was confirmed by its manifest accomplishment. In the first place, it was
no common gift of God that Ishmael should have twelve sons who should possess
rank and authority over as many tribes; but inasmuch as the event corresponded
with the promise, we must chiefly consider the veracity of God, as well as the
singular benevolence and honor which he manifested towards his servant Abraham,
when, even in those benefits which were merely adventitious, he dealt so kindly
and liberally with him; for that may rightly be regarded as adventitious which
was superadded to the spiritual covenant: therefore Moses, after he has
enumerated the towns in which the posterity of Ishmael was distributed, buries
that whole race in oblivion, that substantial perpetuity may remain only in the
Church, according to the declaration in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A228&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
102:28, "the sons of sons shall inhabit." 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F478</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Further, Moses, as with his finger, shows the wonderful counsel of God, because,
in assigning a region distinct from the land of Canaan to the sons of Ishmael,
he has both provided for them in future, and kept the inheritance vacant for the
sons of Isaac.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He died in the presence of
all his brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F479</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The major part of commentators understand this of his <i>death</i>; as if Moses
had said that the life of Ishmael was shorter than that of his brethren, who
long survived him: but because the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lpn</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>naphal</i>) is applied to a violent death, and Moses testifies that Ishmael
died a natural death, this exposition cannot be approved. The Chaldean
Paraphrast supposes the word "<i>lot</i>" to be understood, and elicits this
sense, that the <i>lot fell</i> to him, so as to assign him a habitation not far
from his brethren. Although I do not greatly differ in this matter, I yet think
that the words are not to be thus distorted. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F480</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lpn</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>naphal</i>) sometimes signifies to lie down, or to rest, and also to dwell.
The simple assertion therefore of Moses is, that a habitation was given to
Ishmael opposite his brethren, so that he should indeed be a neighbor to them,
and yet should have his distinct boundaries: 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F481</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for I do not doubt that he referred to the oracle contained in the sixteenth
chapter
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
16:1) where, among other things, the angel said to his mother Hagar, He shall
remain, or pitch his tents in the <i>presence of his brethren</i>. Why does he
rather speak thus of Ishmael than of the others, except for this reason, that
whereas they migrated towards the eastern region, Ishmael, although the head of
a nation, separated from the sons of Abraham, yet retained his dwelling in their
neighborhood? Meanwhile the intention of God is also to be observed, namely,
that Ishmael, though living near his brethren, was yet placed apart in an abode
of his own, that he might not become mingled with them, but might dwell in their
presence, or opposite to them. Moreover, it is sufficiently obvious that the
prediction is not to be restricted <i>personally</i> to
Ishmael.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These are the generations of
Isaac</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Because what Moses has said concerning
the Ishmaelites was incidental, he now returns to the principal subject of the
history, for the purpose of describing the progress of the Church. And in the
first place, he repeats that Isaac's wife was taken from Mesopotamia. He
expressly calls her the sister of Laban the Syrian, who was hereafter to become
the father-in-law of Jacob, and concerning whom he had many things to relate.
But it is chiefly worthy of observation that he declares Rebekah to have been
barren during the early years of her marriage. And we shall afterwards see that
her barrenness continued, not for three or four, but for twenty years, in order
that her very despair of offspring might give greater lustre to the sudden
granting of the blessing. But nothing seems less accordant with reason, than
that the propagation of the Church should be thus small and slow. Abraham, in
his extreme old age, received (as it seems) a slender solace for his long
privation of offspring, in having all his hope centred in one individual. Isaac
also, already advanced in years, and bordering on old age, was not yet a father.
Where, then, was the seed which should equal the stars of heaven in number? Who
would not suppose that God was dealing deceitfully in leaving those houses empty
and solitary, which, according to his own word, ought to be replenished with
teeming population? But that which is recorded in the psalm must be accomplished
in reference to the Church, that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"he maketh her who had
been barren to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of many children."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19B309&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
113:9.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For this small and contemptible origin, these slow
and feeble advances, render more illustrious that increase, which afterwards
follows, beyond all hope and expectation, to teach us that the Church was
produced and increased by divine power and grace, and not by merely natural
means. It is indeed possible, that God designed to correct or moderate any
excess of attachment in Isaac. But this is to be observed as the chief reason
for God's conduct, that as the holy seed was given from heaven, it must not be
produced according to the common order of nature, to the end, that we learn that
the Church did not originate in the industry of man, but flowed from the grace
of God alone.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Isaac entreated the Lord
for his wife</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some translate the passage, Isaac
entreated the <i>Lord in the presence of his wife</i>; and understand this to
have been done, that she also might add her prayers, and they might jointly
supplicate God. But the version here given is more simple. Moreover, this resort
to prayer testifies that Isaac knew that he was deprived of children, because
God had not blessed him. He also knew that fruitfulness was a special gift of
God. For although the favor of obtaining offspring was widely diffused over the
whole human race, when God uttered the words "increase and multiply;" yet to
show that men are not born fortuitously, he distributes this power of production
in various degrees. Isaac, therefore, acknowledges, that the blessing, which was
not at man's disposal, must be sought for by prayer from God. It now truly
appears, that he was endued with no ordinary constancy of faith. Forasmuch as
the covenant of God was known to him, he earnestly (if ever any did) desired
seed. It, therefore, had not now, for the first time, entered into his mind to
pray, seeing that for more than twenty years he had been disappointed of his
hope. Hence, although Moses, only in a single word, says that he had obtained
offspring by his prayers to God; yet reason dictates that these prayers had
continued through many years. The patience of the holy man is herein
conspicuous, that while he seems in vain to pour forth his wishes into the air,
he still does not remit the ardor of his devotion. And as Isaac teaches us, by
his example, to persevere in prayer; so God also shows that he never turns a
deaf ear to the wishes of his faithful people, although he may long defer the
answer.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the children struggled
together</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here a new temptation suddenly
arises, namely, that the infants struggle together in their mother's womb. This
conflict occasions the mother such grief that she wishes for death. And no
wonder; for she thinks that it would be a hundred times better for her to die,
than that she have within her the horrible prodigy of twin &#8212; brothers,
shut up in her womb, carrying on intestine war. They, therefore, are mistaken,
who attribute this complaint to female impatience, since it was not so much
extorted by pain or torture, as by abhorrence of the prodigy. For she doubtless
perceived that this conflict did not arise from natural causes, but was a
prodigy portending some dreadful and tragic end. She also necessarily felt some
fear of the divine anger stealing over her: as it is usual with the faithful not
to confine their thoughts to the evil immediately present with them, but to
trace it to its cause; and hence they tremble through the apprehension of divine
judgment. But though in the beginning she was more grievously disturbed than she
ought to have been, and, breaking out into murmurings, preserved neither
moderation nor temper; yet she soon afterwards receives a remedy and solace to
her grief. We are thus taught by her example to take care that we do not give
excessive indulgence to sorrow in affairs of perplexity, nor inflame our minds
by inwardly cherishing secret causes of distress. It is, indeed, difficult to
restrain the first emotions of our minds; but before they become ungovernable,
we must bridle them, and bring them into subjection. And chiefly we must pray to
the Lord for moderation; as Moses here relates that Rebekah went to ask counsel
from the Lord; because, indeed, she perceived that nothing would be more
effectual in tranquilizing her mind, than to aim at obedience to the will of
God, under the conviction that she was directed by him. For although the
response given might be adverse, or, at least, not such as she would desire, she
yet hoped for some alleviation from a gracious God, with which she might be
satisfied. A question here arises respecting the way in which Rebekah asked
counsel of God. It is the commonly received opinion that she inquired of some
prophet what was the nature of this prodigy: and Moses seems to intimate that
she had gone to some place to hear the oracle. But since that conjecture has no
probability, I rather incline to a different interpretation; namely, that she,
having sought retirement, prayed more earnestly that she might receive a
revelation from heaven. For, at that time, what prophets, except her husband and
her father-in-law, would she have found in the world, still less in that
neighborhood? Moreover, I perceive that God then commonly made known his will by
oracles. Once more, if we consider the magnitude of the affair, it was more
fitting that the secret should be revealed by the mouth of God, than manifested
by the testimony of man. In our times a different method prevails. For God does
not, at this day, reveal things future by such miracles; and the teaching of the
Law, the Prophets, and the Gospel, which comprises the perfection of wisdom, is
abundantly sufficient for the regulation of our course of
life.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Two
nations</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In the first place, God answers that
the contention between the twin-brothers had reference to something far beyond
their own persons; for in this way he shows that there would be discord between
their posterities. When he says, there are two nations, the expression is
emphatical; for since they were brothers and twins, and therefore of one blood,
the mother did not suppose that they would be so far disjoined as to become the
heads of distinct nations; yet God declares that dissension should take place
between those who were by nature joined together. Secondly, he describes their
different conditions, namely, that victory would belong to one of these nations,
forasmuch as this was the cause of the contest, that they could not be equal,
but one was chosen and the other rejected. For since the reprobate give way
reluctantly, it follows of necessity that the children of God have to undergo
many troubles and contests on account of their adoption. Thirdly, the Lord
affirms that the order of nature being inverted, the younger, who was inferior,
should be the victor.</font><br><font face="Palatino">We must now see what this
victory implies. They who restrict it to earthly riches and wealth coldly
trifle. Undoubtedly by this oracle Isaac and Rebekah were taught that the
covenant of salvation would not be common to the two people, but would be
reserved only for the posterity of Jacob. In the beginning, the promise was
apparently general, as comprehending the whole seed: now, it is restricted to
one part of the seed. This is the reason of the conflict, that God divides the
seed of Jacob (of which the condition appeared to be one and the same) in such a
manner that he adopts one part and rejects the other: that one part obtains the
name and privilege of the Church, the rest are reckoned strangers; with one part
resides the blessing of which the other is deprived; as it afterwards actually
occurred: for we know that the Idumaeans were cut off from the body of the
Church; but the covenant of grace was deposited in the family of Jacob. If we
seek the cause of this distinction, it will not be found in nature; for the
origin of both nations was the same. It will not be found in merit; because the
heads of both nations were yet enclosed in their mother's womb when the
contention began. Moreover God, in order to humble the pride of the flesh,
determined to take away from men all occasion of confidence and of boasting. He
might have brought forth Jacob first from the womb; but he made the other the
firstborn, who, at length, was to become the inferior. Why does he thus,
designedly, invert the order appointed by himself, except to teach us that,
without regard to dignity, Jacob, who was to be the heir of the promised
benediction, was gratuitously elected? The sum of the whole, then, is, that the
preference which God gave to Jacob over his brother Esau, by making him the
father of the Church, was not granted as a reward for his merits, neither was
obtained by his own industry, but proceeded from the mere grace of God himself.
But when an entire people is the subject of discourse, reference is made not to
the secret election, which is confirmed to few, but the common adoption, which
spreads as widely as the external preaching of the word. Since this subject,
thus briefly stated, may be somewhat obscure, the readers may recall to memory
what I have said above in expounding the seventeenth chapter
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
17:1) namely, that God embraced, by the grace of his adoption, all the sons of
Abraham, because he made a covenant with all; and that it was not in vain that
he appointed the promise of salvation to be offered promiscuously to all, and to
be attested by the sign of circumcision in their flesh; but that there was a
special chosen seed from the whole people, and these should at length be
accounted the legitimate sons of Abraham, who by the secret counsel of God are
ordained unto salvation. Faith, indeed, is that which distinguishes the
spiritual from the carnal seed; but the question now under consideration is the
<i>principle</i> on which the distinction is made, not the symbol or mark by
which it is attested. God, therefore, chose the whole seed of Jacob without
exception, as the Scripture in many places testifies; because he has conferred
on all alike the same testimonies of his grace, namely, in the word and
sacraments. But another and peculiar election has always flourished, which
comprehended a certain definite number of men, in order that, in the common
destruction, God might save those whom he
would.</font><br><font face="Palatino">A question is here suggested for our
consideration. Whereas Moses here treats of the former kind of election, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F482</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Paul turns his words to the latter. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F483</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For while he attempts to prove, that not all who are Jews by natural descent are
heirs of life; and not all who are descended from Jacob according to the flesh
are to be accounted true Israelites; but that God chooses whom he will,
according to his own good pleasure, he adduces this testimony, the elder shall
serve the younger.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450907&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:7,8,12.) They who endeavor to extinguish the doctrine of gratuitous election,
desire to persuade their readers that the words of Paul also are to be
understood only of external vocation; but his whole discourse is manifestly
repugnant to their interpretation; and they prove themselves to be not only
infatuated, but impudent in their attempt to bring darkness or smoke over this
light which shines so clearly. They allege that the dignity of Esau is
transferred to his younger brother, lest he should glory in the flesh; inasmuch
as a new promise is here given to the latter. I confess there is some force in
what they say; but I contend that they omit the principal point in the case, by
explaining the difference here stated, of the external vocation. But unless they
intend to make the covenant of God of none effect, they must concede that Esau
and Jacob were alike partakers of the external calling; whence it appears, that
they to whom a common vocation had been granted, were separated by the secret
counsel of God. The nature and object of Paul's argument is well known. For when
the Jews, inflated with the title of the Church, rejected the Gospel, the faith
of the simple was shaken, by the consideration that it was improbable that
Christ, and the salvation promised through him, could possibly be rejected by an
elect people, a holy nation, and the genuine sons of God. Here, therefore, Paul
contends that not all who descend from Jacob, according to the flesh, are true
Israelites, because God, of his own good pleasure, may choose whom he will, as
heirs of eternal salvation. Who does not see that Paul descends from a general
to a particular adoption, in order to teach us, that not all who occupy a place
in the Church are to be accounted as true members of the Church? It is certain
that he openly excludes from the rank of children those to whom (he elsewhere
says) pertaineth the adoption; whence it is assuredly gathered, that in proof of
this position, he adduces the testimony of Moses, who declares that God chose
certain from among the sons of Abraham to himself, in whom he might render the
grace of adoption firm and efficacious. How, therefore, shall we reconcile Paul
with Moses? I answer, although the Lord separates the whole seed of Jacob from
the race of Esau, it was done with a view to the Church, which was included in
the posterity of Jacob. And, doubtless, the general election of the people had
reference to this end, that God might have a Church separated from the rest of
the world. What absurdity, then, is there in supposing that Paul applies to
special election the words of Moses, by which it is predicted that the Church
shall spring from the seed of Jacob? And an instance in point was exhibited in
the condition of the heads themselves of these two nations. For Jacob was not
only called by the external voice of the Lord, but, while his brother was passed
by, he was chosen an heir of life. That good pleasure of God, which Moses
commends in the person of Jacob alone, Paul properly extends further: and lest
any one should suppose, that after the two nations had been rendered distinct by
this oracle, the election should pertain indiscriminately to all the sons of
Jacob, Paul brings, on the opposite side, another oracle, I will have mercy on
whom I will have mercy; where we see a certain number severed from the
promiscuous race of Jacob's sons, in the salvation of whom the special election
of God might triumph. Whence it appears that Paul wisely considered the counsel
of God, which was, in truth, that he had transferred the honor of primogeniture
from the elder to the younger, in order that he might choose to himself a
Church, according to his own will, out of the seed of Jacob; not on account of
the merits of men, but as a matter of meres grace. And although God designed
that the means by which the Church was to be collected should be common to the
whole people, yet the end which Paul had in view is chiefly to be regarded;
namely, that there might always be a body of men in the world which should call
upon God with a pure faith, and should be kept even to the end. Let it therefore
remain as a settled point of doctrine, that among men some perish, some obtain
salvation; but the cause of this depends on the secret will of God. For whence
does it arise that they who are born of Abraham are not all possessed of the
same privilege? The disparity of condition certainly cannot be ascribed either
to the virtue of the one, or to the vice of the other, seeing they were not yet
born. Since the common feeling of mankind rejects this doctrine, there have been
found, in all ages, acute men, who have fiercely disputed against the election
of God. It is not my present purpose to refute or to weaken their calumnies: let
it suffice us to hold fast what we gather from Paul's interpretation; that
whereas the whole human race deserves the same destruction, and is bound under
the same sentence of condemnation, some are delivered by gratuitous mercy,
others are justly left in their own destruction: and that those whom God has
chosen are not preferred to others, because God foresaw they <i>would</i> be
holy, but in order that they <i>might</i> be holy. But if the first origin of
holiness is the election of God, we seek in vain for that difference in men,
which rests solely in the will of God. If any one desires a mystical
interpretation of the subject, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F484</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
we may give the following: 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F485</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
whereas many hypocrites, who are for a time enclosed in the womb of the Church,
pride themselves upon an empty title, and, with insolent boastings, exult over
the true sons of God; internal conflicts will hence arise, which will grievously
torment the mother herself.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when her days to be
delivered were fulfilled</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses shows that the
intestine strife in her womb continued to the time of bringing forth; for it was
not by mere accident that Jacob seized his brother by the heel and attempted to
get out before him. The Lord testified by this sign that the effect of his
election does not immediately appear; but rather that the intervening path was
strewed with troubles and conflicts. Therefore Esau's name was allotted to him
on account of his asperity; which even from earliest infancy assumed a manly
form; but the name Jacob signifies that this giant, vainly striving in his
boasted strength, had still been vanquished. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F486</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the boys
grew</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses now briefly describes the manners
of them both. He does not, indeed, commend Jacob on account of those rare and
excellent qualities, which are especially worthy of praise and of remembrance,
but only says that he was <i>simple</i>. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;t</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>tam</i>,) although generally taken for <i>upright</i> and <i>sincere</i>, is
here put antithetically. After the sacred writer has stated that Esau was
robust, and addicted to hunting, he places on the opposite side the mild
disposition of Jacob, who loved the quiet of home so much, that he might seem to
be indolent; just as the Greeks call those persons
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">oijko&gt;sitouv</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>oikositous</i>, who, dwelling at home, give no evidence of their industry. In
short, the comparison implies that Moses praises Esau on account of his vigor,
but speaks of Jacob as being addicted to domestic leisure; and that he describes
the disposition of the former as giving promise that he would be a courageous
man, while the disposition of the latter had nothing worthy of commendation.
Seeing that, by a decree of heaven, the honor of primogeniture would be
transferred to Jacob, why did God suffer him to lie down in his tent, and to
slumber among ashes; unless it be, that he sometimes intends his election to be
concealed for a time, lest men should attribute something to their own
preparatory acts?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Isaac loved
Esau</i></font><font face="Palatino">. That God might more clearly show his own
election to be sufficiently firm, to need no assistance elsewhere, and even
powerful enough to overcome any obstacle whatever, he permitted Esau to be so
preferred to his brother, in the affection and good opinion of his father, that
Jacob appeared in the light of a rejected person. Since, therefore, Moses
clearly demonstrates, by so many circumstances, that the adoption of Jacob was
founded on the sole good pleasure of God, it is an intolerable presumption to
suppose it to depend upon the will of man; or to ascribe it, in part, to means,
(as they are called,) and to human preparations. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F487</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But how was it possible for the father, who was not ignorant of the oracle, to
be thus predisposed in favor of the firstborn, whom he knew to be divinely
rejected?. It would rather have been the part of piety and of modesty to subdue
his own private affection, that he might yield obedience to God. The firstborn
prefers a natural claim to the chief place in the parent's affection; but the
father was not at liberty to exalt <i>him</i> above his brother, who had been
placed in subjection by the oracle of God. That also is still more shameful and
more unworthy of the holy patriarch, which Moses adds; namely, that he had been
induced to give this preference to Esau, by the taste of his venison. Was he so
enslaved to the indulgence of the palate, that, forgetting the oracle, he
despised the grace of God in Jacob, while he preposterously set his affection on
him whom God had rejected? Let the Jews now go and glory in the flesh; since
Isaac, preferring food to the inheritance destined for his son, would pervert
(as far as he had the power) the gratuitous covenant of God! For there is no
room here for excuse; since with a blind, or, at least, a most inconsiderate
love to his firstborn, he undervalued the younger. It is uncertain whether the
mother was chargeable with a fault of the opposite kind. For we commonly find
the affections of parents so divided, that if the wife sees any one of the sons
preferred by her husband, she inclines, by a contrary spirit of emulation, more
towards another. Rebekah loved her son Jacob more than Esau. If, in so doing,
she was obeying the oracle, she acted rightly; but it is possible that her love
was ill regulated. And on this point the corruption of nature too much betrays
itself. There is no bond of mutual concord more sacred than that of marriage:
children form still further links of connection; and yet they often prove the
occasion of dissension. But since we soon after see Rebekah chiefly in earnest
respecting the blessing of God, the conjecture is probable, that she had been
induced, by divine authority, to prefer the younger to the firstborn. Meanwhile,
the foolish affection of the father only the more fully illustrates the grace of
the divine adoption.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob sod
pottage</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This narration differs little from the
sport of children. Jacob is cooking pottage; his brother returns from hunting
weary and famishing, and barters his birthright for food. What kind of bargain,
I pray, was this? Jacob ought of his own accord to have satisfied the hunger of
his brother. When being asked, he refuses to do so: who would not condemn him
for his inhumanity? In compelling Esau to surrender his right of primogeniture,
he seems to make an illicit and frivolous compact. God, however, put the
disposition of Esau to the proof in a matter of small moment; and still farther,
designed to present an instance of Jacob's piety, or, (to speak more properly,)
he brought to light what lay hid in both. Many indeed are mistaken in suspending
the cause of Jacob's election on the fact, that God foresaw some worthiness in
him; and in thinking that Esau was reprobated, because his future impiety had
rendered him unworthy of the divine adoption before he was born. Paul, however,
having declared election to be gratuitous, denies that the distinction is to be
looked for in the persons of men; and, indeed, first assumes it as an axiom,
that since mankind is ruined from its origin, and devoted to destruction,
whosoever are saved are in no other way freed from destruction than by the mere
grace of God. And, therefore, that some are preferred to others, is not on
account of their own merits; but seeing that all are alike unworthy of grace,
they are saved whom God, of his own good pleasure, has chosen. He then ascends
still higher, and reasons thus: Since God is the Creator of the world, he is, by
his own right, in such a sense, the arbiter of life and death, that he cannot be
called to account; but his own will is (so to speak) the <i>cause of causes</i>.
And yet Paul does not, by thus reasoning, impute tyranny to God, as the sophists
triflingly allege in speaking of his absolute power. But whereas He dwells in
inaccessible light, and his judgments are deeper than the lowest abyss, Paul
prudently enjoins acquiescence in God's sole purpose; lest, if men seek to be
too inquisitive, this immense chaos should absorb all their senses. It is
therefore foolishly inferred by some, from this place, that whereas God chose
one of the two brothers, and passed by the other, the merits of both had been
foreseen. For it was necessary that God should have decreed that Jacob should
differ from Esau, otherwise he would not have been unlike his brother. And we
must always remember the doctrine of Paul, that no one excels another by means
of his own industry or virtue, but by the grace of God alone. Although, however,
both the brothers were by nature equal, yet Moses represents to us, in the
person of Esau, as in a mirror, what kind of men all the reprobate are, who,
being left to their own disposition, are not governed by the spirit of God.
While, in the person of Jacob, he shows that the grace of adoption is not idle
in the elect, because the Lord effectually attests it by his vocation. Whence
then does it arise that Esau sets his birthright to sale, but from this cause,
that he, being deprived of the Spirit of God, relishes only the things of the
earth? And whence does it happen that his brother Jacob, denying himself his own
food, patiently endures hunger, except that under the guidance of the Holy
Spirit, he raises himself above the world and aspires to a heavenly life? Hence,
let us learn, that they to whom God does not vouchsafe the grace of his Spirit,
are carnal and brutal; and are so addicted to this fading life, that they think
not of the spiritual kingdom of God; but them whom God has undertaken to govern,
are not so far entangled in the snares of the flesh as to prevent them from
being intent upon their high vocation. Whence it follows, that all the reprobate
remain immersed in the corruptions of the flesh; but that the elect are renewed
by the Holy Spirit, that they may be the workmanship of God, created unto good
works. If any one should raise the objection, that part of the blame may be
ascribed to God, because he does not correct the stupor and the depraved desires
inherent in the reprobate, the solution is ready, that God is exonerated by the
testimony of their own conscience, which compels them to condemn themselves.
Wherefore, nothing remains but that all flesh should keep silence before God,
and that the whole world, confessing itself to be obnoxious to his judgment,
should rather be humbled than proudly
contend.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Feed me, I pray thee, with
that same red pottage</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F488</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Although Esau declares in these words that he by no means desires delicacies,
but is content with food of any kind, (seeing that he contemptuously designates
the pottage from its color only, without regard to its taste,) we may yet
lawfully conjecture that the affair was viewed in a serious light by his
parents; for his own name had not been given him on account of any ludicrous
matter. In desiring and asking food he commits nothing worthy of reprehension;
but when he says, Behold I am at the point to die, and what profit shall this
birthright do to me? he betrays a profane desire entirely addicted to the earth
and to the flesh. It is not, indeed, to be doubted that he spake sincerely, when
he declared that he was impelled by a sense of the approach of death. For they
are under a misapprehension who understand him to use the words, "Behold I die,"
as if he meant merely to say, that his life would not be long, because, by
hunting daily among wild beasts, his life was in constant danger. Therefore, in
order to escape immediate death, he exchanges his birthright for food;
notwithstanding, he grievously sins in so doing, because he regards his
birthright as of no value, unless it may be made profitable in the present life.
For, hence it happens, that he barters a spiritual for an earthly and fading
good. On this account the Apostle calls him a "profane person,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
12:16,) as one who settles in the present life, and will not aspire higher. But
it would have been his true wisdom rather to undergo a thousand deaths than to
renounce his birthright; which, so far from being confined within the narrow
limits of one age alone, was capable of transmitting the perpetuity of a
heavenly life to his posterity also. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F489</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Now, let each of us look well to himself; for since the disposition of us all is
earthly, if we follow nature as our leader, we shall easily renounce the
celestial inheritance. Therefore, we should frequently recall to mind the
Apostle's exhortation, "Let us not be profane persons as Esau
was."</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>33.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob said, Swear to
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Jacob did not act cruelly towards his
brother, for he took nothing from him, but only desired a confirmation of that
right which had been divinely granted to him; and he does this with a pious
intention, that he may hereby the more fully establish the certainty of his own
election. Meanwhile the infatuation of Esau is to be observed, who, in the name
and presence of God, does not hesitate to set his birthright to sale. Although
he had before rushed inconsiderately upon the food under the maddening impulse
of hunger; now, at least, when an oath is exacted from him, some sense of
religion should have stolen over him to correct his brutal cupidity. But he is
so addicted to gluttony that he makes God himself a witness of his
ingratitude.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>34.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then Jacob
gave</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Although, at first sight, this statement
seems to be cold and superfluous, it is nevertheless of great weight. For, in
the first place, Moses commends the piety of holy Jacob, who in aspiring to a
heavenly life, was able to bridle the appetite for food. Certainly he was not a
log of wood; in preparing the food for the satisfying of his hunger, he would
the more sharpen his appetite. Wherefore he must of necessity do violence to
himself in order to bear his hunger. But he would never have been able in this
manner to subdue his flesh, unless a spiritual desire of a better life had
flourished within him. On the other side, the remarkable indifference of his
brother Esau is emphatically described in few words, he did eat and drink, and
rose up and went his way. For what reason are these four things stated? Truly,
that we may know what is declared immediately after, that he accounted the
incomparable benefit of which he was deprived as nothing. The complaint of the
Lacedemonian captive is celebrated by the historians. The army, which had long
sustained a siege, surrendered to the enemy for want of water. After they had
drunk out of the river, O comrades, (he exclaimed,) for what a little pleasure
have we lost an incomparable good! He, miserable man, having quenched his
thirst, returned to his senses, and mourned over his lost liberty. But Esau
having satisfied his appetite, did not consider that he had sacrificed a
blessing far more valuable than a hundred lives, to purchase a repast which
would be ended in half an hour. Thus are all profane persons accustomed to act:
alienated from the celestial life, they do not perceive that they have lost
anything, till God thunders upon them out of heaven. As long as they enjoy their
carnal wishes, they cast the anger of God behind them; and hence it happens that
they go stupidly forward to their own destruction. Wherefore let us learn, if,
at any time, we, being deceived by the allurements of the world, swerve from the
right way, quickly to rouse ourselves from our slumber.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And there was a
famine</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses relates that Isaac was tried by
nearly the same kind of temptation as that through which his father Abraham had
twice passed. I have before explained how severe and violent was this assault.
The condition in which it was the will of God to place his servants, as
strangers and pilgrims in the land which he had promised to give them, seemed
sufficiently troublesome and hard; but it appears still more intolerable, that
he scarcely suffered them to exist (if we may so speak) in this wandering,
uncertain, and changeable kind of life, but almost consumed them with hunger.
Who would not say that God had forgotten himself, when he did not even supply
his own children, &#8212; whom he had received into his especial care and trust,
&#8212; however sparingly and scantily, with food? But God thus tried the holy
fathers, that we might be taught, by their example, not to be effeminate and
cowardly under temptations. Respecting the terms here used, we may observe, that
though there were two seasons of dearth in the time of Abraham, Moses alludes
only to the one, of which the remembrance was most recent. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F490</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord appeared unto
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I do not doubt but a reason is here given
why Isaac rather went to the country of Gerar than to Egypt, which perhaps would
have been more convenient for him; but Moses teaches that he was withheld by a
heavenly oracle, so that a free choice was not left him. It may here be asked,
why does the Lord prohibit Isaac from going to Egypt, whither he had suffered
his father to go? Although Moses does not give the reason, yet we may be allowed
to conjecture that the journey would have been more dangerous to the son. The
Lord could indeed have endued the son also with the power of his Spirit, as he
had done his father Abraham, so that the abundance and delicacies of Egypt
should not have corrupted him by their allurements; but since he governs his
faithful people with such moderation, that he does not correct all their faults
at once, and render them entirely pure, he assists their infirmities, and
anticipates, with suitable remedies, those evils by which they might be
ensnared. Because, therefore, he knew that there was more infirmity in Isaac
than there had been in Abraham, he was unwilling to expose him to danger; for he
is faithful, and will not suffer his own people to be tempted beyond what they
are able to bear.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461013&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 10:13.) Now, as we must be persuaded, that however arduous and
burdensome may be the temptations which alight upon us, the Divine help will
never fail to renew our strength; so, on the other hand, we must beware lest we
rashly rush into dangers; but each should be admonished by his own infirmity to
proceed cautiously and with
fear.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Dwell in the
land</i></font><font face="Palatino">. God commands him to settle in the
promised land, yet with the understanding that he should dwell there as a
stranger. The intimation was thus given, that the time had not yet arrived in
which he should exercise dominion over it. God sustains indeed his mind with the
hope of the promised inheritance, but requires this honor to be given to his
word, that Isaac should remain inwardly at rest, in the midst of outward
agitations; and truly we never lean upon a better support than when,
disregarding the appearance of things present, we depend entirely upon the word
of the Lord, and apprehend by faith that blessing which is not yet apparent.
Moreover, he again inculcates the promise previously made, in order to render
Isaac more prompt to obey; for so is the Lord wont to awaken his servants from
their indolence, that they may fight valiantly for him, while he constantly
affirms that their labor shall not he in vain; for although he requires from us
a free and unreserved obedience, as a father does from his children, he yet so
condescends to the weakness of our capacity, that he invites and encourages us
by the prospect of reward.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because that Abraham obeyed my
voice</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses does not mean that Abraham's
obedience was the reason why the promise of God was confirmed and ratified to
him; but from what has been said before,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
22:18,) where we have a similar expression, we learn, that what God freely
bestows upon the faithful is sometimes, beyond their desert, ascribed to
themselves; that they, knowing their intention to be approved by the Lord, may
the more ardently addict and devote themselves entirely to his service: so he
now commends the obedience of Abraham, in order that Isaac may be stimulated to
an imitation of his example. And although laws, statutes, rites, precepts, and
ceremonies, had not yet been written, Moses used these terms, that he might the
more clearly show how sedulously Abraham regulated his life according to the
will of God alone &#8212; how carefully he abstained from all the impurities of
the heathen &#8212; and how exactly he pursued the straight course of holiness,
without turning aside to the right hand or to the left: for the Lord often
honors his own law with these titles for the sake of restraining our excesses;
as if he should say that it wanted nothing to constitute it a perfect rule, but
embraced everything pertaining to absolute holiness. The meaning therefore is,
that Abraham, having formed his life in entire accordance with the will of God,
walked in his pure service.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the men of the place asked
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses relates that Isaac was tempted in
the same manner as his father Abraham, in having his wife taken from him; and
without doubt he was so led by the example of his father, that he, being
instructed by the similarity of the circumstances, might become associated with
him in his faith. Nevertheless, on this point he ought rather to have avoided
than imitated his father's fault; for no doubt he well remembered that the
chastity of his mother had twice been put in great danger; and although she had
been wonderfully rescued by the hand of God, yet both she and her husband paid
the penalty of their distrust: therefore the negligence of Isaac is inexcusable,
in that he now strikes against the same stone. He does not in express terms deny
his wife; but he is to be blamed, first, because, for the sake of preserving his
life, he resorts to an evasion not far removed from a lie; and secondly,
because, in absolving his wife from conjugal fidelity, he exposes her to
prostitution: but he aggravates his fault, principally (as I have said) in not
taking warning from domestic examples, but voluntarily casting his wife into
manifest danger. Whence it appears how great is the propensity of our nature to
distrust, and how easy it is to be devoid of wisdom in affairs of perplexity.
Since, therefore, we are surrounded on all sides with so many dangers, we must
ask the Lord to confirm us by his Spirit, lest our minds should faint, and be
dissolved in fear and trembling; otherwise we shall be frequently engaged in
vain enterprises, of which we shall repent soon, and yet too late to remedy the
evil.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Abimelech, king of the
Philistines, looked out at a window</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Truly
admirable is the kind forbearance of God, in not only condescending to pardon
the twofold fault of his servant, but in stretching forth his hand, and in
wonderfully averting, by the application of a speedy remedy, the evil which he
would have brought upon himself. God did not suffer &#8212; what twice had
occurred to Abraham &#8212; that his wife should be torn from his bosom; but
stirred up a heathen king, mildly, and without occasioning him any trouble, to
correct his folly. But although God sets before us such an example of his
kindness, that the faithful, if at any time they may have fallen, may
confidently hope to find him gentle and propitious; yet we must beware of
self-security, when we observe, that the holy woman who was, at that time, the
only mother of the Church on earth, was exempted from dishonor, by a special
privilege. Meanwhile, we may conjecture, from the judgment of Abimelech, how
holy and pure had been the conduct of Isaac, on whom not even a suspicion of
evil could fall; and further, how much greater integrity flourished in that age
than in our own. For why does he not condemn Isaac as one guilty of fornication,
since it was probable that some crime was concealed, when he disingenuously
obtruded the name of sister, and tacitly denied her to be his wife? And
therefore I have no doubt that his religion, and the integrity of his life,
availed to defend his character. By this example we are taught so to cultivate
righteousness in our whole life, that men may not be able to suspect anything
wicked or dishonorable respecting us; for there is nothing which will more
completely vindicate us from every mark of infamy than a life passed in modesty
and temperance. We must, however, add, what I have also before alluded to, that
lusts were not, at that time, so commonly and so profusely indulged, as to cause
an unfavourable suspicion to enter into the mind of the king concerning a
sojourner of honest character. Wherefore, he easily persuades himself that
Rebekah was a wife and not a harlot. The chastity of that age is further proved
from this, that Abimelech takes the familiar sporting of Isaac with Rebekah as
an evidence of their marriage. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F491</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For Moses does not speak about marital intercourse, but about some too free
movement, which was a proof of either dissolute exuberance or conjugal love. But
now licentiousness has so broken through all bounds, that husbands are compelled
to hear in silence of the dissolute conduct of their wives with
strangers.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What is this thou hast done
unto us?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Lord does not chastise Isaac as he
deserved, perhaps because he was not so fully endued with patience as his father
was; and, therefore, lest the seizing of his wife should dishearten him, God
mercifully prevents it. Yet, that the censure may produce the deeper shame, God
constitutes a heathen his master and his reprover. We may add, that Abimelech
chides his folly, not so much with the design of injuring him, as of upbraiding
him. It ought, however, deeply to have wounded the mind of the holy man, when he
perceived that his offense was obnoxious to the judgment even of the blind.
Wherefore, let us remember that we must walk in the light which God has kindled
for us, lest even unbelievers, who are wrapped in the darkness of ignorance,
should reprove our stupor. And certainly when we neglect to obey the voice of
God, we deserve to be sent to oxen and asses for instruction. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F492</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Abimelech, truly, does not investigate nor prosecute the whole offense of Isaac,
but only alludes to one part of it. Yet Isaac, when thus gently admonished by a
single word, ought to have condemned himself, seeing that, instead of committing
himself and his wife to God, who had promised to be the guardian of them both,
he had resorted, through his own unbelief, to an illicit remedy. For faith has
this property, that it confines us within divinely prescribed bounds, so that we
attempt nothing except with God's authority or permission. Whence it follows
that Isaac's faith wavered when he swerved from his duty as a husband. We
gather, besides, from the words of Abimelech, that all nations have the
sentiment impressed upon their minds, that the violation of holy wedlock is a
crime worthy of divine vengeance, and have consequently a dread of the judgment
of God. For although the minds of men are darkened with dense clouds, so that
they are frequently deceived; yet God has caused some power of discrimination
between right and wrong to remain, so that each should bear about with him his
own condemnation, and that all should be without excuse. If, then, God cites
even unbelievers to his tribunal, and does not suffer them to escape just
condemnation, how horrible is that punishment which awaits us, if we endeavor to
obliterate, by our own wickedness, that knowledge which God has engraven on our
consciences?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Abimelech charged all his
people</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In denouncing capital punishment
against any who should do injury to this stranger, we may suppose him to have
issued this edict as a special privilege; for it isnot customary thus rigidly to
avenge every kind of injury. Whence, then, arose this disposition on the part of
the king to prefer Isaac to all the native inhabitants of the country, and
almost to treat him as an equal, except that some portion of the divine majesty
shone forth in him, which secured to him this degree of reverence? God, also, to
assist the infirmity of his servant, inclined the mind of the heathen king, in
every way, to show him favor. And there is no doubt that his general modesty
induced the king thus carefully to protect him; for he, perceiving him to be a
timid man, who had been on the point of purchasing his own life by the ruin of
his wife, was the more disposed to assist him in his dangers, in order that he
might live in security under his own
government.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then Isaac
sowed</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here Moses proceeds to relate in what
manner Isaac reaped the manifest fruit of the blessing promised to him by God;
for he says, that when he had sowed, the increase was a hundredfold: which was
an extraordinary fertility, even in that land. He also adds, that he was rich in
cattle, and had a very great household. Moreover, he ascribes the praise of all
these things to the blessing of God; as it is also declared in the psalm, that
the Lord abundantly supplies what will satisfy his people while they sleep.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19C702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
127:2.) It may, however, be asked, how could Isaac sow when God had commanded
him to be a stranger all his life? Some suppose that he had bought a field, and
so translate the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnq</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>kanah</i>) a possession; but the context corrects their error: for we find
soon afterwards, that the holy man was not delayed, by having land to sell, from
removing his effects elsewhere: besides, since the purchasing of land was
contrary to his peculiar vocation and to the command of God, Moses undoubtedly
would not have passed over such a notable offense. To this may be added, that
since express mention is immediately made of a tent, we may hence infer, that
wherever he might come, he would have to dwell in the precarious condition of a
stranger. We must, therefore, maintain, that he sowed in a hired field. For
although he had not a foot of land in his own possession, yet, that he might
discharge the duty of a good householder, it behaved him to prepare food for his
family; and perhaps hunger quickened his care and industry, that he might with
the greater diligence make provision for himself against the future.
Nevertheless, it is right to keep in mind, what I have lately alluded to, that
he received as a divine favor the abundance which he had acquired by his own
labor.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Philistines envied
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We are taught by this history that the
blessings of God which pertain to the present earthly life are never pure and
perfect, but are mixed with some troubles, lest quiet and indulgence should
render us negligent. Wherefore, let us all learn not too ardently to desire
great wealth. If the rich are harassed by any cause of disquietude, let them
know that they are roused by the Lord, lest they should fall fast asleep in the
midst of their pleasures; and let the poor enjoy this consolation, that their
poverty is not without its advantages. For it is no light good to live free from
envy, tumults, and strifes. Should any one raise the objection, that it can by
no means be regarded as a favor, that God, in causing Isaac to abound in wealth,
exposed him to envy, to contentions, and to many troubles; there is a ready
answer, that not all the troubles with which God exercises his people, in any
degree prevent the benefits which he bestows upon them from retaining the taste
of his paternal love. Finally, he so attempers the favor which he manifests
towards his children in this world, that he stirs them up, as with sharp goads,
to the consideration of a celestial life. It was not, however, a slight trial,
that the simple element of water, which is the common property of all animals,
was denied to the holy patriarch; with how much greater patience ought we to
bear our less grievous sufferings! If, however, at any time we are angry at
being unworthily injured; let us remember that, at least, we are not so cruelly
treated as holy Isaac was, when he had to contend for water. Besides, not only
was he deprived of the element of water, but the wells which his father Abraham
had dug for himself and his posterity were filled up. This, therefore, was the
extreme of cruelty, not only to defraud a stranger of every service due to him,
but even to take from him what had been obtained by the labor of his own father,
and what he possessed without inconvenience to any
one.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Abimelech said unto
Isaac</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is uncertain whether the king of
Gerar expelled Isaac of his own accord from his kingdom, or whether he commanded
him to settle elsewhere, because he perceived him to be envied by the people. He
possibly might, in this manner, advise him as a friend; although it is more
probable that his mind had become alienated from Isaac; for at the close of the
chapter Moses relates, that the holy man complains strongly of the king as well
as of others. But since we can assert nothing with certainty respecting the real
feelings of the lying, let it suffice to maintain, what is of more importance,
that in consequence of the common wickedness of mankind, they who are the most
eminent fall under the suspicion of the common people. Satiety, indeed, produces
ferocity. Wherefore there is nothing to which the rich are more prone than
proudly to boast, to carry themselves more insolently than they ought, and to
stretch every nerve of their power to oppress others. No such suspicion, indeed,
could fall upon Isaac; but he had to bear that envy which was the attendant on a
common vice. Whence we infer, how much more useful and desirable it often is,
for us to be placed in a moderate condition; which is, at least, more peaceful,
and which is neither exposed to the storms of envy, nor obnoxious to unjust
suspicions. Moreover, how rare and unwonted was the blessing of God in rendering
Isaac prosperous, may be inferred from the fact, that his wealth had become
formidable both to the king and to the people. A large inheritance truly had
descended to him from his father; but Moses shows, that from his first entrance
into the land, he had so greatly prospered in a very short time, that it seemed
no longer possible for the inhabitants to endure
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Isaac digged again the
wells of water</i></font><font face="Palatino">. First, we see that the holy man
was so hated by his neighbors, as to be under the necessity of seeking a retreat
for himself which was destitute of water; and no habitation is so troublesome
and inconvenient for the ordinary purposes of life as that which suffers from
scarcity of water. Besides, the abundance of his cattle and the multitude of his
servants &#8212; who were like a little army &#8212; rendered a supply of water
very necessary; whence we learn that he was brought into severe straits. But
that this last necessity did not instigate him to seek revenge, is a proof of
singular forbearance; for we know that lighter injuries will often rack the
patience even of humane and moderate men. If any one should object to this view,
that he was deficient in strength; I grant, indeed, that he was not able to
undertake a regular war; but as his father Abraham had armed four hundred
servants, he also certainly had a large troop of domestics, who could easily
have repelled any force brought against him by his neighbors. But the hope which
he had entertained when he settled in the valley of Gerar, was again suddenly
cut off. He knew that his father Abraham had there used wells which were his
own, and which he had himself discovered; and although they had been stopped up,
yet they were well known to have sufficient springs of water to prevent the
labor of digging them again from being misspent. Moreover, the fact that the
wells had been obstructed ever since the departure of Abraham, shows how little
respect the inhabitants had for their guest; for although their own country
would have been benefited by these wells, they chose rather to deprive
themselves of this advantage than to have Abraham for a neighbor; for, in order
that such a convenience might not attract him to the place, they, by stopping up
the wells, did, in a certain sense, intercept his way. It was a custom among the
ancients, if they wished to involve any one in ruin, and to cut him off from the
society of men, to interdict him from water, and from fire: thus the Philistine,
for the purpose of removing Abraham from their vicinity, deprive him of the
element of water.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He called
their names</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He did not give new names to the
wells, but restored those which had been assigned them by his father Abraham,
that, by this memorial, the ancient possession of them might be renewed. But
subsequent violence compelled him to change their names, that at least he might,
by some monument, make manifest the injury which had been done by the
Philistines, and reprove them on account of it: for whereas he calls one well
<i>strife</i>, or <i>contention</i>, another <i>hostility</i>, he denies that
the inhabitants possessed that by right, or by any honest title, which they had
seized upon as enemies or robbers. Meanwhile, it is right to consider, that in
the midst of these strifes he had a contest not less severe with thirst and
deficiency of water, whereby the Philistines attempted to destroy him; such is
the scope of the history. First, Moses, according to his manner, briefly runs
through the summary of the affair: namely, that Isaac intended to apply again to
his own purpose the wells which his father had previously found, and to acquire,
in the way of recovery, the lost possession of them. He then prosecutes the
subject more diffusely, stating that, when he attempted the work, he was
unjustly defrauded of his labor; and whereas, in digging the third well, he
gives thanks to God, and calls it <i>Room</i>, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F493</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because, by the favor of God, a more copious supply is now afforded him, he
furnishes an example of invincible patience. Therefore, however severely he may
have been harassed, yet when, after he had been freed from these troubles, he so
placidly returns thanks to God, and celebrates his goodness, he shows that in
the midst of trials he has retained a composed and tranquil
mind.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he went up from thence to
Beer-sheba</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Next follows a more abundant
consolation, and one affording effectual refreshment to the mind of the holy
man. In the tranquil enjoyment of the well, he acknowledges the favor which God
had showed him: but forasmuch as one word of God weighs more with the faithful
than the accumulated mass of all good things, we cannot doubt that Isaac
received this oracle more joyfully than if a thousand rivers of nectar had
flowed unto him: and truly Moses designedly commemorates in lofty terms this act
of favor, that the Lord encouraged him by his own word,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012624&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
26:24;) whence we may learn, in ascribing proper honor to each of the other
gifts of God, still always to give the palm to that proof of his paternal love
which he grants us in his word. Food, clothing, health, peace, and other
advantages, afford us a taste of the Divine goodness; but when he addresses us
familiarly, and expressly declares himself to be our Father, then indeed it is
that he thoroughly refreshes us to satiety. Moses does not explain what had been
the cause of Isaac's removal to Beer-sheba, the ancient dwelling-place of his
fathers. It might be that the Philistines ceased not occasionally to annoy him;
and thus the holy man, worn out with their implacable malice, removed to a
greater distance. It is indeed probable, taking the circumstance of the time
into account, that he was sorrowful and anxious; for as soon as he had arrived
at that place, God appeared unto him on the very first night. Here, then,
something very opportune is noticed. Moreover, as often as Moses before related
that God had appeared unto Abraham, he, at the same time, showed that the holy
man was either tormented with grievous cares, or was held in suspense under some
apprehension, or was plunged in sadness, or, after many distresses, was nearly
borne down by fatigue, so as to render it apparent that the hand of God was
seasonably stretched out to him as his necessity required, lest he should sink
under the evils which surrounded him. So now, as I explain it, he came to Isaac,
for the purpose of restoring him, already wearied and broken down by various
miseries.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord appeared unto
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This vision (as I have elsewhere said) was
to prepare him to listen more attentively to God, and to convince him that it
was God with whom he had to deal; for a voice <i>alone</i> would have had less
energy. Therefore God <i>appears</i>, in order to produce confidence in and
reverence towards his word. In short, visions were a kind of symbols of the
Divine presence, designed to remove all doubt from the minds of the holy fathers
respecting him who was about to speak. Should it be objected, that such evidence
was not sufficiently sure, since Satan often deceives men by similar
manifestations, being, as it were, the ape of God; &#8212; we must keep in mind
what has been said before, that a clear and unambiguous mark was engraven on the
visions of God, by which the faithful might certainly distinguish them from
those which were fallacious, so that their faith should not be kept in suspense:
and certainly, since Satan can only delude us in the dark, God exempts his
children from this danger, by illuminating their eyes with the brightness of his
countenance. Yet God did not fully manifest his glory to the holy fathers, but
assumed a form by means of which they might apprehend him according to the
measure of their capacities; for, as the majesty of God is infinite, it cannot
be comprehended by the human mind, and by its magnitude it absorbs the whole
world. Besides, it follows of necessity that men, on account of their infirmity,
must not only faint, but be altogether annihilated in the presence of God.
Wherefore, Moses does not mean that God was seen in his true nature and
greatness, but in such a manner as Isaac was able to bear the sight. But what we
have said, namely, that the vision was a testimony of Deity, for the purpose of
giving credibility to the oracle, will more fully appear from the context; for
this appearance was not a mute spectre; but the word immediately followed, which
confirmed, in the mind of Isaac, faith in gratuitous adoption and
salvation.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am the God of
Abraham</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This preface is intended to renew the
memory of all the promises before given, and to direct the mind of Isaac to the
perpetual covenant which had been made with Abraham, and which was to be
transmitted, as by tradition, to his posterity. The Lord therefore begins by
declaring himself to be the God who had spoken at the first to Abraham, in order
that Isaac might not sever the present from the former oracles: for as often as
he repeated the testimony of his grace to the faithful, he sustained their faith
with fresh supports. Yet he would have that very faith to remain based upon the
first covenant by which he had adopted them to himself: and we must always keep
this method in mind, in order that we may learn to gather together the promises
of God, as they are combined in an inseparable bond. Let this also ever occur to
us, as a first principle, that God thus kindly promises us his grace because he
has freely adopted us.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fear
not</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Since these words are elsewhere expounded,
I shall now be the more brief. In the first place, we must observe, that God
thus addresses the faithful for the purpose of tranquillizing their minds; for,
if his word be withdrawn, they necessarily become torpid through stupidity, or
are tormented with disquietude. Whence it follows, that we can receive peace
from no other source than from the mouth of the Lord, when he declares himself
the author of our salvation; not that we are then free from all fear, but
because the confidence of faith is sufficiently efficacious to assuage our
perturbations. Afterwards the Lord gives proofs of his love, by its effect, when
he promises that he will bless Isaac.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he builded an altar
there</i></font><font face="Palatino">. From other passages we are well aware
that Moses here speaks of public worship; for inward invocation of God neither
requires an altar; nor has any special choice of place; and it is certain that
the saints, wherever they lived, worshipped. But because religion ought to
maintain a testimony before men, Isaac, having erected and consecrated an altar,
professes himself a worshipper of the true and only God, and by this method
separates himself from the polluted rites of heathens. He also built the altar,
not for himself alone, but for his whole family; that there, with all his
household, he might offer sacrifices. Moreover, since the altar was built for
the external exercises of faith, the expression, he called upon God, implies as
much as if Moses had said that Isaac celebrated the name of God, and gave
testimony of his own faith. The visible worship of God had also another use;
namely, that men, according to their infirmity, may stimulate and exercise
themselves in the fear of God. Besides, since we know that sacrifices were then
commanded, we must observe that Isaac did not rashly trifle in worshipping God,
but adhered to the rule of faith, that he might undertake nothing without the
word of God. Whence also we infer how preposterous and erroneous a thing it is
to imitate the fathers, unless the Lord join us with them by means of a similar
command. Meanwhile, the words of Moses clearly signify, that whatever exercises
of piety the faithful undertake are to be directed to this end, namely, that God
may be worshipped and invoked. To this point, therefore, all rites and
ceremonies ought to have reference. But although it was the custom of the holy
fathers to build an altar in whatever place they pitched their tent, we yet
gather, from the connection of the words, that after God appeared to his servant
Isaac, this altar was built by him in token of his
gratitude.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And there Isaac's
servants digged a well</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is remarkable that
whereas this place had already received its name from the well which had been
dug in it, Isaac should there again have to seek water, especially since Abraham
had purchased, for himself and his posterity, the right to the well from the
king. Moreover, the digging itself was difficult and labourious; for Moses had a
design in saying, that afterwards the servants came and said to him, We have
found water. I have, therefore, no doubt, that throughout the whole of that
region a conspiracy had been entered into by the inhabitants, for the purpose of
expelling the holy man, through want of water; so that this well of Sheba also
had been fraudulently stopped up. The context also shows, that the first care of
the holy patriarch concerned the worship of God, because Moses relates that an
altar was erected, before he speaks of the well. Now it is of importance to
observe with what great troubles these holy fathers continually had to contend;
which they never would have been able to overcome or to endure, unless they had
been far removed from our delicate course of living. For how severely should we
feel the loss of water, seeing that we often rage against God if we have not
abundance of wine? Therefore, by such examples, let the faithful learn to
accustom themselves to patient endurance: and if at any time food and other
necessaries of life fail them, let them turn their eyes to Isaac, who wandered,
parched with thirst, in the inheritance which had been divinely promised him.

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then Abimelech went to
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We have had an exactly similar narrative
in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012122&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
21:22. The Lord, therefore, followed Isaac with the same favor which he had
before shown to his father Abraham. For it was no common blessing, that
Abimelech should voluntarily seek his friendship. Besides, he would be relieved
from no little care and anxiety, when his neighbors, who had harassed him in so
many ways, being now themselves afraid of him, desire to secure his friendship.
Therefore the Lord both confers signal honor upon his servant, and provides at
the same time for his tranquility. There is not the least doubt that the king
was led to this measure, by a secret divine impulse. For, if he was afraid, why
did he not resort to some other remedy? Why did he humble himself to supplicate
a private man? Why, at least, did he not rather send for him, or command him
with authority to do what he wished? But God had so forcibly impressed his mind,
that he, forgetting his regal pride, sought for peace and alliance with a man
who was neither covetous, nor warlike, nor furnished with a great army. Thus we
may learn, that the minds of men are in the hand of God, so that he not only can
incline those to gentleness who before were swelling with fury, but can humble
them by terror, as often as he pleases.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Isaac said unto them,
Wherefore come ye to me?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Isaac not only
expostulates concerning injuries received, but protests that in future he can
have no confidence in them, since he had found in them a disposition so hostile
to himself. This passage teaches us, that it is lawful for the faithful to
complain of their enemies, in order, if possible, to recall them from their
purpose of doing injury, and to restrain their force, frauds, and acts of
injustice. For liberty is not inconsistent with patience: nor does God require
of his own people, that they should silently digest every injury which may be
inflicted upon them, but only that they should restrain their minds and hands
from revenge. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F495</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Now, if their minds are pure and well regulated, their tongues will not be
virulent in reproaching the faults of others; but their sole purpose will be to
restrain the wicked by a sense of shame from iniquity. For where there is no
hope of profiting by complaints, it is better to cherish peace by silence;
unless, perhaps, for the purpose of rendering those who delight themselves in
wickedness inexcusable. We must, indeed, always beware, lest, from a desire of
vengeance, our tongues break out in reproaches; and, as Solomon says, hatred
stirreth up strifes.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;201012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
10:12.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We saw certainly that the
Lord was with thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By this argument they prove
that they desired a compact with Isaac, not insidiously, but in good faith,
because they acknowledge the favor of God towards him. For it was necessary to
purge themselves from this suspicion, seeing that they now presented themselves
so courteously to one against whom they had before been unreasonably opposed.
This confession of theirs, however, contains very useful instruction. Profane
men in calling one, whose affairs all succeed well and prosperously, the blessed
of the Lord, bear testimony that God is the author of all good things, and that
from him alone flows all prosperity. Exceedingly base, therefore, is our
ingratitude, if, when God acts kindly towards us, we pass by his benefits with
closed eyes. Again, profane men regard the friendship of one whom God favors, as
desirable for themselves; considering that there is no better or holier
commendation than the love of God. Perversely blind, therefore, are they, who
not only neglect those whom God declares to be dear unto him, but also
iniquitously vex them. The Lord proclaims himself ready to execute vengeance on
any one who may injure those whom he takes under his protection; but the greater
part, unmoved by this most terrible denunciation, still wickedly afflict the
good and the simple. We here, however, see that the sense of nature dictated to
unbelievers, what we scarcely credit when spoken by the mouth of God himself.
Still it is surprising that they should be afraid of an inoffensive man; and
should require from him an oath that he would do them no injury. They ought to
have concluded, from the favor which God had showed him, that he was a just man,
and therefore there could be no danger from him; yet because they form their
estimate of him from their own disposition and conduct, they also distrust his
probity. Such perturbation commonly agitates unbelievers, so that they are
inconsistent with themselves; or at least waver and are tossed between
conflicting sentiments, and have nothing fixed and equable. For those principles
of right judgment, which spring up in their breasts, are soon smothered by
depraved affections. Hence it happens, that what is justly conceived by them
vanishes; or is at least corrupted, and does not bring forth good
fruit.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As we have not touched
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. An accusing conscience urges them to
desire to hold him closely bound unto them; and therefore they require an oath
from him that he will not hurt them. For they knew that he might rightfully
avenge himself on them for the sufferings he had endured: but they dissemble on
this point, and even make a wonderful boast of their own acts of kindness. At
first, indeed, the humanity of the king was remarkable, for he not only
entertained Isaac with hospitality, but treated him with peculiar honor; yet he
by no means continued to act thus to the end. It accords, however, with the
common custom of men, to disguise their own faults by whatever artifice or color
they can invent. But if we have committed any offense, it rather becomes us
ingenuously to confess our fault, than by denying it, to wound still more deeply
the minds of those whom we have injured. Nevertheless Isaac, since he had
already sufficiently pierced their consciences, does not press them any further.
For strangers are not to be treated by us as domestics; but if they do not
receive profit, they are to be left to the judgment of God. Therefore, although
Isaac does not extort from them a just confession; yet, that he may not be
thought inwardly to cherish any hostility towards them, he does not refuse to
strike a covenant with them. Thus we learn from his example, that if any have
estranged themselves from us, they are not to be repelled when they again offer
themselves to us. For if we are commanded to follow after peace, even when it
seems to fly from us, it behoves us far less to be repulsive, when our enemies
voluntarily seek reconciliation; especially if there be any hope of amendment in
future, although true repentance may not yet appear. And he receives them to a
feast, not only for the sake of promoting peace, but also for the sake of
showing that he, having laid aside all offense, has become their
friend.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou art now the
blessed of the Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is commonly explained
to mean that they court his favor by flatteries, just as persons are accustomed
to flatter when they ask favor; but I rather think this expression to have been
added in a different sense. Isaac had complained of their injuries in having
expelled him through envy: they answer, that there was no reason why any
particle of grief should remain in his mind, since the Lord had treated him so
kindly and so exactly according to his own wish; as if they had said, What dost
thou want? Art thou not content with thy present success? Let us grant that we
have not discharged the duty of hospitality towards thee; yet the blessing of
God abundantly suffices to obliterate the memory of that time. Perhaps, however,
by these words, they again assert that they are acting towards him with good
faith, because he is under the guardianship of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And sware one to
another</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Isaac does not hesitate to swear;
partly, that the Philistines may be the more easily appeased; partly, that he
may not be suspected by them. And this is the legitimate method of swearing,
when men mutually bind themselves to the cultivation of peace. A simple promise,
indeed, ought to have sufficed; but since dissimulations or inconstancy causes
men to be distrustful of each other, the Lord grants them the use of his name,
that this more holy confirmation may be added to our covenants; and he does not
only permit, he even commands us to swear as often as necessity requires it.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;050613&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
6:13.) Meanwhile we must beware, lest his name be profaned by rashly
swearing.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>32.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to pass the same
day</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Hence it appears, (as I have said a little
before,) that the waters were not found in a moment of time. If it be asked,
whence a supply of water had been obtained for his cattle and his household
during the intervening days, I doubt not, indeed, that he either bought it, or
was compelled to go to a distance to see if any one would be found from whom he
might obtain it by entreaty. With respect to the name, (Sheba,) they are
mistaken, in my judgment, who deem it to be any other than that which Abraham
had first given to the well. For since the Hebrew word is ambiguous, Abraham
alluded to the covenant which he had struck with the king of Gerar; but now
Isaac recalling this ancient memorial to mind, joins with it the covenant in
which he had himself engaged.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>34.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Esau was forty years
old</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For many reasons Moses relates the
marriages of Esau. Inasmuch as he mingled himself with the inhabitants of the
land, from whom the holy race of Abraham was separated, and contracted
affinities by which he became entangled; this was a kind of prelude of his
rejection. It happened also, by the wonderful counsel of God, that these
daughters-in-law were grievous and troublesome to the holy patriarch (Isaac) and
his wife, in order that they might not by degrees become favorable to that
reprobate people. If the manners of the people had been pleasing, and they had
had good and obedient daughters, perhaps also, with their consent, Isaac might
have taken a wife from among them. But it was not lawful for those to be bound
together in marriage, whom God designed to be perpetual enemies. For how would
the inheritance of the land be secured to the posterity of Abraham, but by the
destruction of those among whom he sojourned for a time? Therefore God cuts off
all inducements to these inauspicious marriages, that the disunion which he had
established might remain. It appears hence, with what perpetual affection Esau
was loved by Isaac; for although the holy man justly regarded his son's wives
with aversion, and his mind was exasperated against them, he never failed to act
with the greatest kindness towards his son, as we shall afterwards see. We have
elsewhere spoken concerning polygamy. This corruption had so far prevailed in
every direction among many people, that the custom, though vicious, had acquired
the force of law. It is not, therefore, surprising that a man addicted to the
flesh indulged his appetite by taking two wives.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to pass that when
Isaac was old</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In this chapter Moses
prosecutes, in many words, a history which does not appear to be of great
utility. It amounts to this; Esau having gone out, at his father's command, to
hunt; Jacob, in his brother's clothing, was, by the artifice of his mother,
induced to obtain by stealth the blessing due by the right of nature to the
firstborn. It seems even like child's play to present to his father a kid
instead of venison, to feign himself to be hairy by putting on skins, and, under
the name of his brother, to get the blessing by a lie. But in order to learn
that Moses does not in vain pause over this narrative as a most serious matter,
we must first observe, that when Jacob received the blessing from his father,
this token confirmed to him the oracle by which the Lord had preferred him to
his brother. For the benediction here spoken of was not a mere prayer but a
legitimate sanction, divinely interposed, to make manifest the grace of
election. God had promised to the holy fathers that he would be a God to their
seed for ever. They, when at the point of death, in order that the succession
might be secured to their posterity, put them in possession, as if they would
deliver, from hand to hand, the favor which they had received from God. So
Abraham, in blessing his son Isaac, constituted him the heir of spiritual life
with a solemn rite. With the same design, Isaac now, being worn down with age,
imagines himself to be shortly about to depart this life, and wishes to bless
his firstborn son, in order that the everlasting covenant of God may remain in
his own family. The Patriarchs did not take this upon themselves rashly, or on
their own private account, but were public and divinely ordained witnesses. To
this point belongs the declaration of the Apostle, "the less is blessed of the
better."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580707&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
7:7.) For even the faithful were accustomed to bless each other by mutual
offices of charity; but the Lord enjoined this peculiar service upon the
patriarchs, that they should transmit, as a deposit to posterity, the covenant
which he had struck with them, and which they kept during the whole course of
their life. The same command was afterwards given to the priests, as appears in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;040624&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
6:24, and other similar places. Therefore Isaac, in blessing his son, sustained
another character than that of a father or of a private person, for he was a
prophet and an interpreter of God, who constituted his son an heir of the same
grace which he had received. Hence appears what I have already said, that Moses,
in treating of this matter, is not without reason thus prolix. But let us weigh
each of the circumstances of the case in its proper order; of which this is the
first, that God transferred the blessing of Esau to Jacob, by a mistake on the
part of the father; whose eyes, Moses tells us, were dim. The vision also of
Jacob was dull when he blessed his grandchildren Ephraim and Manasseh; yet his
want of sight did not prevent him from cautiously placing his hands in a
transverse direction. But God suffered Isaac to be deceived, in order to show
that it was not by the will of man that Jacob was raised, contrary to the course
of nature, to the right and honor of
primogeniture.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, now I am old, I know not
the day of my death</i></font><font face="Palatino">. There is not the least
doubt that Isaac implored daily blessings on his sons all his life: this,
therefore, appears to have been an extraordinary kind of benediction. Moreover,
the declaration that he knew not the day of his death, is as much as if he had
said, that death was every moment pressing so closely upon him, a decrepit and
failing man, that he dared not promise himself any longer life. Just as a woman
with child when the time of parturition draws near, might say, that she had now
no day certain. Every one, even in the full vigor of age, carries with him a
thousand deaths. Death claims as its own the foetus in the mother's womb, and
accompanies it through every stage of life. But as it urges the old more
closely, so they ought to place it more constantly before their eyes, and should
pass as pilgrims through the world, or as those who have already one foot in the
grave. In short, Isaac, as one near death, wishes to leave the Church surviving
him in the person of his son.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That my soul may bless
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Wonderfully was the faith of the holy man
blended with a foolish and inconsiderate carnal affection. The general principle
of faith flourishes in his mind, when, in blessing his son, he consigns to him,
under the direction of the Holy Spirit, the right of the inheritance which had
been divinely promised to himself. Meanwhile, he is blindly carried away by the
love of his firstborn son, to prefer him to the other; and in this way he
contends against the oracle of God. For he could not be ignorant of that which
God had pronounced before the children were born. If any one would excuse him,
inasmuch as he had received no command from God to change the accustomed order
of nature by preferring the younger to the elder; this is easily refuted:
because when he knew that the firstborn was rejected, he still persisted in his
excessive attachment. Again, in neglecting to inquire respecting his duty, when
he had been informed of the heavenly oracle by his wife, his indolence was by no
means excusable. For he was not altogether ignorant of his calling; therefore,
his obstinate attachment to his son was a kind of blindness, which proved a
greater obstacle to him than the external dimness of his eyes. Yet this fault,
although deserving of reprehension, did not deprive the holy man of the right of
pronouncing a blessing; but plenary authority remained with him, and the force
and efficacy of his testimony stood entire, just as if God himself had spoken
from heaven; to which subject I shall soon again
allude.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Rebekah
heard</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses now explains more fully the
artifice by which Jacob attained the blessing. It truly appears ridiculous, that
an old man, deceived by the cunning of his wife, should, through ignorance and
error, have given utterance to what was contrary to his wish. And surely the
stratagem of Rebekah was not without fault; for although she could not guide her
husband by salutary counsel, yet it was not a legitimate method of acting, to
circumvent him by such deceit. For, as a lie is in itself culpable, she sinned
more grievously still in this, that she desired to sport in a sacred matter with
such wiles. She knew that the decree by which Jacob had been elected and adopted
was immutable; why then does she not patiently wait till God shall confirm it in
fact, and shall show that what he had once pronounced from heaven is certain?
Therefore, she darkens the celestial oracle by her lie, and abolishes, as far as
she was able, the grace promised to her son. Now, if we consider farther, whence
arose this great desire to bestir herself; her extraordinary faith will on the
other hand appear. For, as she did not hesitate to provoke her husband against
herself, to light up implacable enmity between the brothers, to expose her
beloved son Jacob to the danger of immediate death, and to disturb the whole
family; this certainly flowed from no other source than her faith. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F496</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The inheritance promised by God was firmly fixed in her mind; she knew that it
was decreed to her son Jacob. And therefore, relying upon the covenant of God,
and keeping in mind the oracle received, she forgets the world. Thus, we see,
that her faith was mixed with an unjust and immoderate zeal. This is to be
carefully observed, in order that we may understand that a pure and distinct
knowledge does not always so illuminate the minds of the pious as to cause them
to be governed, in all their actions, by the Holy Spirit, but that the little
light which shows them their path is enveloped in various clouds of ignorance
and error; so that while they hold a right course, and are tending towards the
goal, they yet occasionally slide. Finally, both in Isaac and in his wife the
principle of faith was preeminent. But each, by ignorance in certain
particulars, and by other faults, either diverged a little from the way, or, at
least, stumbled in the way. But seeing that, nevertheless, the election of God
stood firm; nay, that he even executed his design through the deceit of a woman,
he vindicates, in this manner, the whole praise of his benediction to his own
gratuitous goodness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob said to
Rebekah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. That Jacob does not voluntarily
present himself to his father, but rather fears lest, his imposture being
detected, he should bring a curse upon himself, is very contrary to faith. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F497</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For when the Apostle teaches, that "whatsoever is not of faith is sin,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451423&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
14:23,) he trains the sons of God to this sobriety, that they may not permit
themselves to undertake anything with a doubtful and perplexed conscience. This
firm persuasion is the only rule of right conduct, when we, relying on the
command of God, go intrepidly wheresoever he calls us. Jacob, therefore, by
debating with himself, shows that he was deficient in faith; and certainly,
although he was not entirely without it, yet, in this point, he is convicted of
failure. But by this example we are again taught, that faith is not always
extinguished by a given fault; yet, if God sometimes bears with his servants
thus far, that he turns, what they have done perversely, to their salvation, we
must not hence take a license to sin. It happened by the wonderful mercy of God,
that Jacob was not cut off from the grace of adoption. Who would not rather fear
than become presumptuous? And whereas we see that his faith was obscured by
doubting, let us learn to ask of the Lord the spirit of prudence to govern all
our steps. There was added another error of no light kind: for why does he not
rather reverence God than dread his father's anger? Why does it not rather occur
to his mind, that a foul blot would stain the hallowed adoption of God, when it
seemed to owe its accomplishment to a lie? For although it tended to a right
end, it was not lawful to attain that end, through this oblique course.
Meanwhile, there is no doubt that faith prevailed over these impediments. For
what was the cause why he preferred the bare and apparently empty benediction of
his father, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F498</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to the quiet which he then enjoyed, to the conveniences of home, and finally to
life itself? According to the flesh, the father's benediction, of which he was
so desirous, that he knowingly and willingly plunged himself into great
difficulties, was but an imaginary thing. Why did he act thus, but because in
the exercise of simple faith in the word of God, he more highly valued the hope
which was hidden from him, shall the desirable condition which he actually
enjoyed? Besides, his fear of his father's anger had its origin in the true fear
of God. He says that he feared lest he should bring upon himself a curse. But he
would not so greatly have dreaded a verbal censure, if he had not deemed the
grace deposited in the hands of his father worth more than a thousand lives. It
was therefore under an impulse of God that he feared his father, who was really
God's minister. For when the Lord sees us creeping on the earth, he draws us to
himself by the hand of man. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F499</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Upon me be thy curse, my
son</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here Rebekah sins again, because she burns
with such hasty zeal that she does not consider how highly God disapproves of
her evil course. She presumptuously subjects herself to the curse. But whence
this unheeding confidence? Being unfurnished with any divine command, she took
her own counsel. Yet no one will deny that this zeal, although preposterous,
proceeds from special reverence for the word of God. For since she was informed
by the oracle of God, that Jacob was preferred in the sight of God, she
disregarded whatever was visible in the world, and whatever the sense of nature
dictated, in comparison with God's secret election. Therefore we are taught by
this example, that every one should walk modestly and cautiously according to
the rule of his vocation; and should not dare to proceed beyond what the Lord
allows in his word.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he went and
fetched</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Although it is probable that Jacob was
not only influenced by a desire to yield obedience to the authority of his
mother, but was also persuaded by her seasonings, he yet sinned by overstepping
the bounds of his vocation. When Rebekah had taken the blame upon herself, she
told him, doubtless, that injury was done to no one: because Jacob was not
stealing away another's right, but only seeking the blessing which was decreed
to him by the celestial oracle. It seemed a fair and probable excuse for the
fraud, that Isaac, unless he should be imposed upon, was prepared to invalidate
the election of God. Therefore Jacob, instead of simply declining from what was
right in submission to his mother, was rather obeying the word of God. In the
meantime (as I have said) this particular error was not free from blame: because
the truth of God was not to be aided by such falsehoods. The paternal
benediction was a seal of God's grace, I confess it; but she ought rather to
have waited till God should bring relief from heaven, by changing the mind and
guiding the tongue of Isaac, than have attempted what was unlawful. For if
Balaam, who prostituted his venal tongue, was constrained by the Spirit,
contrary to his own wish, to bless the elect people, whom he would rather have
devoted to destruction,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;042212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
22:12,) how much more powerfully would the same spirit have influenced the
tongue of holy Isaac, who was not a mercenary man, but one who desired
faithfully to obey God, and was only hurried by an error in a contrary
direction? Therefore, although in the main, faith shone preeminently in holy
Jacob, yet in this respect he bears the blame of rashness, in that he was
distrustful of the providence of God, and fraudulently gained possession of his
father's blessing.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob said unto his
father, I am Esau</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F500</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
At first Jacob was timid and anxious; now, having dismissed his fear, he
confidently and audaciously lies. By which example we are taught, that when any
one has transgressed the proper bounds of duty, he soon allows himself
unmeasured license. Wherefore there is nothing better than for each to keep
himself within the limits divinely prescribed to him, lest by attempting more
than is lawful, he should open the door to Satan. I have before shown how far
his seeking the blessing by fraud, and insinuating himself into the possession
of it by falsehood, was contrary to faith. Yet this particular fault and
divergence from the right path, did not prevent the faith which had been
produced by the oracle from holding on, in some way, its course. In excusing the
quickness of his return by saying that the venison was brought to him by God, he
speaks in accordance with the rule of piety: he sins, however, in mixing the
sacred name of God with his own falsehoods. Thus, when there is a departure from
truth, the reverence which is apparently shown to God is nothing else than a
profanation of his glory. It was right that the prosperous issue of his hunting
should be ascribed to the providence of God, lest we should imagine that any
good thing was the result of chance; but when Jacob pretended that God was the
author of a benefit which had not been granted to himself, and that, too, as a
cloak for his deception, his fault was not free from
perjury.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come near, I pray thee, that
I may feel thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It hence appears that the holy
man was suspicious of fraud, and therefore hesitated. Whence it may seem that
the benediction was vain, seeing it had no support of faith. But it thus pleased
God so to perform his work by the hand of Isaac, as not to make him, who was the
instrument, a willing furtherer of his design. Nor is it absurd that Isaac, like
a blind man, should ignorantly transfer the blessing to a different person from
him whom he intended. The ordinary function of pastors has something of a
similar kind; for since by the command of God, they reconcile men to him, yet
they do not discern to whom this reconciliation comes; thus they cast abroad the
seed, but are uncertain respecting the fruit. Wherefore God does not place the
office and power with which he has invested them, under the control of their own
judgment. In this way the ignorance of Isaac does not nullify the heavenly
oracles; and God himself, although the senses of his servant fail, does not
desist from the accomplishment of his purpose. Here we have a clear refutation
of the figment of the Papists, that the whole force of the sacrament depends
upon the intention of the man who consecrates; as if, truly, it were left to the
will of man to frustrate the design of God. Nevertheless, what I have already so
often said must be remembered, that however Isaac might be deceived in the
person of his son, he yet did not pronounce the blessing in vain: because a
general faith remained in his mind and in part governed his conduct. In forming
his judgment from the touch, disregarding the voice, he did not act according to
the nature of faith. And, therefore, with respect to the person, he was plainly
in error. This, however, did not happen in consequence of negligence; since he
diligently and even anxiously turned every way, that he might not deprive the
firstborn of his right. But it pleased the Lord thus to render his senses dull,
partly for the purpose of showing, how vain it is for men to strive to change
what he has once decreed, (because it is impossible hut that his counsel should
remain firm and stable though the whole world should oppose it,) and partly, for
the purpose of correcting, by this kind of chastisement, the absurd attachment
by which Isaac was too closely bound to his firstborn. For whence arose this
minute investigation, except from the fact that an inordinate love of Esau,
which had taken entire possession of his mind, turned him aside from the divine
oracle? Therefore, since he yielded an excessive indulgence to natural feeling,
he deserved in every way to be blinded. So much the greater care ought we to
take that, in carrying on God's work, we should not give the reins to our human
affections.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come near now, and kiss
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We know that the practice of kissing was
then in use, which many nations retain to this day. Profane men, however, may
say, that it is ludicrous for an old man, whose mind was already obtuse, and who
moreover had eaten and drunk heartily, should pour forth his benedictions upon a
person who was only acting a part. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F501</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But whereas Moses has previously recorded the oracle of God, by which the
adoption was destined for the younger son, it behoves us reverently to
contemplate the secret providence of God, towards which profane men pay no
respect. Truly Isaac was not so in bondage to the attractions of meat and drink
as to be unable, with sobriety of mind, to reflect upon the divine command given
unto him, and to undertake in seriousness, and with a certain faith in his own
vocation, the very work in which, on account of the infirmity of his flesh, he
vacillated and halted. Therefore, we must not form our estimate of this blessing
from the external appearance, but from the celestial decree; even as it appeared
at length, by the issue, that God neither vainly sported, nor that man rashly
proceeded in this affair: and, truly, if the same religion dwells in us which
flourished in the patriarch's heart, nothing will hinder the divine power from
shining forth the more clearly in the weakness of
man.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>See, the smell of my son is
as the smell of a field</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The allegory of
Ambrose on this passage is not displeasing to me. Jacob, the younger brother, is
blessed under the person of the elder; the garments which were borrowed from his
brother breathe an odour grateful and pleasant to his father. In the same manner
we are blessed, as Ambrose teaches, when, in the name of Christ, we enter the
presence of our Heavenly Father: we receive from him the robe of righteousness,

are put in his place. But Isaac seems here to desire and implore nothing for his
son but what is earthly; for this is the substance of his words, that it might
be well with his son in the world, that he might gather together the abundant
produce of the earth, that he might enjoy great peace, and shine in honor above
others. There is no mention of the heavenly kingdom; and hence it has arisen,
that men without learning, and but little exercised in true piety, have imagined
that these holy fathers were blessed by the Lord only in respect to this frail
and transitory life. But it appears from many passages to have been far
otherwise: and as to the fact that Isaac here confines himself to the earthly
favors of God, the explanation is easy; for the Lord did not formerly set the
hope of the future inheritance plainly before the eyes of the fathers, (as he
now calls and raises us directly towards heaven,) but he led them as by a
circuitous course. Thus he appointed the land of Canaan as a mirror and pledge
to them of the celestial inheritance. In all his acts of kindness he gave them
tokens of his paternal favor, not indeed for the purpose of making them content
with present good, so that they should neglect heaven, or should follow a merely
empty shadow, as some foolishly suppose; but that, being aided by such helps,
according to the time in which they lived, they might by degrees rise towards
heaven; for since Christ, the first-fruits of those who rise again, and the
author of the eternal and incorruptible life, had not yet been manifested, his
spiritual kingdom was, in this way, shadowed forth under figures only, until the
fullness of the time should come; and as all the promises of God were involved,
and in a sense clothed in these symbols, so the faith of the holy fathers
observed the same measure, and made its advances heavenwards by means of these
earthly rudiments. Therefore, although Isaac makes the temporal favors of God
prominent, nothing is further from his mind than to confine the hope of his son
to this world; he would raise him to the same elevation to which he himself
aspired. Some proof of this may be drawn from his own words; for this is the
principal point, that he assigns him the dominion over the nations. But whence
the hope of such a dignity, unless he had been persuaded that his race had been
elected by the Lord, and, indeed, with this stipulation, that the right of the
kingdom should remain with one son only? Meanwhile, let it suffice to adhere to
this principle, that the holy man, when he implores a prosperous course of life
for his son, wishes that God, in whose paternal favor stands our solid and
eternal happiness, may be propitious to
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cursed be every one that
curseth thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. What I have before said must be
remembered, namely, that these are not bare wishes, such as fathers are wont to
utter on behalf of their children, but that promises of God are included in
them; for Isaac is the authorized interpreter of God, and the instrument
employed by the Holy Spirit; and therefore, as in the person of God, he
efficaciously pronounces those accursed who shall oppose the welfare of his son.
This then is the confirmation of the promise, by which God, when he receives the
faithful under his protection, declares that he will be an enemy to their
enemies. The whole force of the benediction turns to this point, that God will
prove himself to be a kind father to his servant Jacob in all things, so that he
will constitute him the chief and the head of a holy and elect people, will
preserve and defend him by his power, and will secure his salvation in the face
of enemies of every kind.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jacob was yet scarce gone
out</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here is added the manner in which Esau was
repulsed, which circumstance availed not a little to confirm the benediction to
Jacob: for if Esau had not been rejected, it might seem that he was not deprived
of that honor which nature had given him: but now Isaac declares, that what he
had done, in virtue of his patriarchal office, could not but be ratified. Here,
truly, it again appears, that the primogeniture which Jacob obtained, at the
expense of his brother, was made his by a free gift; for if we compare the works
of both together, Esau obeys his father, brings him the produce of his hunting,
prepares for his father the food obtained by his own labor, and speaks nothing
but the truth: in short, we find nothing in him which is not worthy of praise.
Jacob never leaves his home, substitutes a kid for venison, insinuates himself
by many lies, brings nothing which would properly commend him, but in many
things deserves reprehension. Hence it must be acknowledged, that the cause of
this event is not to be traced to works, but that it lies hid in the eternal
counsel of God. Yet Esau is not unjustly reprobated, because they who are not
governed by the Spirit of God can receive nothing with a right mind; only let it
be firmly maintained, that since the condition of all is equal, if any one is
preferred to another, it is not because of his own merit, but because the Lord
has gratuitously elected him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>33.

exceedingly</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F502</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Here now again the faith which had been smothered in the breast of the holy man
shines forth and emits fresh sparks; for there is no doubt that his fear springs
from faith. Besides, it is no common fear which Moses describes, but that which
utterly confounds the holy man: for, whereas he was perfectly conscious of his
own vocation, and therefore was persuaded that the duty of naming the heir with
whom he should deposit the covenant of eternal life was divinely enjoined upon
him, he no sooner discovered his error than he was filled with fear, that in an
affair so great and so serious God had suffered him to err; for unless he had
thought that God was the director of this act, what should have hindered him
from alleging his ignorance as an excuse, and from becoming enraged against
Jacob, who had stolen in upon him by fraud and by unjustifiable arts? But
although covered with shame on account of the error he had committed, he
nevertheless, with a collected mind, ratifies the benediction which he had
pronounced; and I do not doubt that he then, as one awaking, began to recall to
memory the oracle to which he had not been sufficiently attentive. Wherefore,
the holy man was not impelled by ambition to be thus tenacious of his purpose,
as obstinate men are wont to be, who prosecute to the last what they have once,
though foolishly, begun; but the declaration, I have blessed him, yea, and he
shall be blessed, was the effect of a rare and precious faith; for he,
renouncing the affections of the flesh, now yields himself entirely to God, and,
acknowledging God as the Author of the benediction which he had uttered,
ascribes due glory to him in not daring to retract it. The benefit of this
doctrine pertains to the whole Church, in order that we may certainly know, that
whatever the heralds of the gospel promise to us by the command of God, will be
efficacious and stable, because they do not speak as private men, but as by the
command of God himself; and the infirmity of the minister does not destroy the
faithfulness, power, and efficacy of God's word. He who presents himself to us
charged with the offer of eternal happiness and life, is subject to our common
miseries and to death; yet, notwithstanding, the promise is efficacious. He who
absolves us from sins is himself a sinner; but because his office is divinely
assigned him, the stability of this grace, having its foundation in God, shall
never fail.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>34.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He cried with a great and
exceeding bitter cry</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Though Esau persists in
imploring the blessing, he yet gives a sign of desperation, which is the reason
why he obtains no benefit, because he enters not by the gate of faith. True
piety, indeed, draws forth tears and great cries from the children of God; but
Esau, trembling and full of fears, breaks out in wailings; afterwards he casts,
at a venture, his wish into the air, that he also may receive a blessing. But
his blind incredulity is reproved by his own words; for whereas one blessing
only had been deposited with his father, he asks that another should be given to
him, as if it were in his father's power indiscriminately to breathe out
blessings, independently of the command of God. Here the admonition of the
Apostle may suggest itself to our
minds,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"that Esau, when he sought
again the forfeited blessing with tears and loud lamentations, found no place
for
repentance,"</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Hebrews

too late, and without profit, because God avenges himself of their idleness. We
must therefore fear lest if, with deafened ears, we suffer the voice of God now
to pass unheeded by, he should, in turn, become deaf to our cry. But it may be
asked, how is this repulse consistent with the
promise,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"If the wicked will turn
from all his sins that he has committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that

18:21.)</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moreover, it may seem at variance with
the clemency of God to reject the sighings of those who, being crushed by
misery, fly for refuge to his mercy. I answer, that repentance, if it be true
and sincere, will never be too late; and the sinner who, from his soul, is
displeased with himself, will obtain pardon: but God in this manner punishes the
contempt of his grace, because they who obstinately reject it, do not seriously
purpose in their mind to return to him. Thus it is that they who are given up to
a reprobate mind are never touched with genuine penitence. Hypocrites truly
break out into tears, like Esau, but their heart within them will remain closed
as with iron bars. Therefore, since Esau rushes forward, destitute of faith and
repentance, to ask a blessing, there is no wonder that he should be
rejected.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>36.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is he not rightly named
Jacob?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> That the mind of Esau was affected with
no sense of penitence appears hence; he accused his brother and took no blame to
himself. But the very beginning of repentance is grief felt on account of sin,
together with self-condemnation. Esau ought to have descended into himself, and
to have become his own judge. Having sold his birthright, he had darted, like a
famished dog, upon the meat and the pottage; and now, as if he had done no
wrong, he vents all his anger on his brother. Further, if the blessing is deemed
of any value, why does he not consider that he had been repelled from it, not
simply by the fraud of man, but by the providence of God? We see, therefore,
that like a blind man feeling in the dark, he cannot find his
way.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>37.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I have made him thy
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Isaac now more openly confirms what I
have before said, that since God was the author of the blessing, it could
neither be vain nor evanescent. For he does not here magnificently boast of his
dignity, but keeps himself within the bounds and measure of a servant, and
denies that he is at liberty to alter anything. For he always considers, (which
is the truth,) that when he sustains the character of God's representative, it
is not lawful for him to proceed further than the command will bear him. Hence,
indeed, Esau ought to have learned from whence he had fallen by his own fault,
in order that he might have humbled himself, and might rather have joined
himself with his brother, in order to become a partaker of his blessing, as his
inferior, than have desired anything separately for himself. But a depraved
cupidity carries him away, so that he, forgetful of the kingdom of God, pursues
and cares for nothing except his own private advantage. Again, we must notice
Isaac's manner of speaking, by which he claims a certain force and efficacy for
his benediction, as if his word carried with it dominion, abundance of corn and
wine, and whatever else God had promised to Abraham. For God, in requiring the
faithful to depend on himself alone, would nevertheless have them to rest
securely upon the word, which, at his command, is declared to them by the tongue
of men. In this way <i>they</i> are said to remit sins, who are only the
messengers and interpreters of free
forgiveness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>38.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hast thou but one
blessing</i></font><font face="Palatino">? Esau seems to take courage; but he
neglects the care of his soul, and turns, like a swine, to the pampering of his
flesh. He had heard that his father had nothing left to grant; because, truly,
the full and entire grace of God so rested upon Jacob, that out of his family
there was no happiness. Wherefore, if Esau sought his own welfare, he ought to
have drawn from that fountain, and rather to have subjected himself to his
brother, than to have cut himself off from a happy connection with him. He
chose, however, rather to be deprived of spiritual grace, provided he might but
possess something of his own, and apart from his brother, than to be his
inferior at home. He could not be ignorant, that there was one sole benediction
by which his brother Jacob had been constituted the heir of the divine covenant:
for Isaac would be daily discoursing with them concerning the singular privilege
which God had vouchsafed to Abraham and his seed. Esau would not previously have
complained so bitterly, unless he had felt that he had been deprived of an
incomparable benefit. Therefore, by departing from this one source of blessing,
he indirectly renounces God, and cuts himself off from the body of the Church,
caring for nothing but this transitory life. But it would have been better for
him, miserably to perish through the want of all things in this world, and with
difficulty to draw his languishing breath, than to slumber amidst temporal
delights. What afterwards follows, &#8212; namely, that he wept with loud
lamentations, &#8212; is a sign of fierce and proud indignation, rather than of
penitence; for he remitted nothing of his ferocity, but raged like a cruel beast
of prey. So the wicked, when punishment overtakes them, bewail the salvation
they have lost; but, meanwhile, do not cease to delight themselves in their
vices; and instead of heartily seeking after the righteousness of God, they
rather desire that his deity should be extinct. Of a similar character is that
gnashing of teeth and weeping in hell which, instead of stimulating the
reprobate to seek after God, only consumes them with unknown
torments</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>39.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, thy dwelling shall be the
fatness of the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. At length Esau obtains
what he had asked. For, perceiving himself to be cast down from the rank and
honor of primogeniture, he chooses rather to have prosperity in the world,
separated from the holy people, than to submit to the yoke of his younger
brother. But it may be thought that Isaac contradicts himself, in offering a new
benediction, when he had before declared, that he had given to his son Jacob all
that was placed at his disposal. I answer, that what has been before said
concerning Ishmael must be noted in this place. For God, though he hearkened to
Abraham's prayer for Ishmael, so far as concerned the present life, yet
immediately restricts his promise, by adding the exception implied in the
declaration, that in Isaac only should the seed be called. I do not, however,
doubt, that the holy man, when he perceived that his younger son Jacob was the
divinely ordained heir of a happy life, would endeavor to retain his firstborn,
Esau, in the bond of fraternal connection, in order that he might not depart
from the holy and elect flock of the Church. But now, when he sees him
obstinately tending in another direction, he declares what will be his future
condition. Meanwhile the spiritual blessing remains in its integrity with Jacob
alone, to whom Esau refusing to attach himself, voluntarily becomes an exile
from the kingdom of God. The prophecy uttered by Malachi,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;390103&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
1:3,) may seem to be contradictory to this statement. For, comparing the two
brothers, Esau and Jacob, with each other, he teaches that Esau was hated,
inasmuch as a possession was given to him in the deserts; and yet Isaac promises
him a fertile land. There is a twofold solution: either that the Prophet,
speaking comparatively, may with truth call Idumea a desert in comparison with
the land of Canaan, which was far more fruitful; or else that he was referring
to his own times. For although the devastations of both lands had been terrible,
yet the land of Canaan in a short time flourished again, while the territory of
Edom was condemned to perpetual sterility, and given up to dragons. Therefore,
although God, with respect to his own people, banished Esau to desert mountains,
he yet gave to him a land sufficiently fertile in itself to render the promise
by no means nugatory. For that mountainous region both had its own natural
fruitfulness, and was so watered by the dew of heaven, that it would yield
sustenance to its inhabitants.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>40.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By thy sword shalt thou live,
and shalt serve thy brother</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is to be
observed that events are here predicted which were never fulfilled in the person
of Esau; and therefore, that the prophecy is concerning things at that time far
distant. For Jacob was so far from having obtained dominion over his brother,
that on his return from Padan-aram, he suppliantly tendered him his obedience;
and the breaking off of the yoke which Isaac here mentions, is referred to a
very remote period. He is therefore relating the future condition of Esau's
posterity. And he says first, that they shall live by their sword: which words
admit a twofold sense, either that, being surrounded by enemies, they shall pass
a warlike and unquiet life; or that they shall be free, and their own masters.
For there is no power to use the sword where there is no liberty. The former
meaning seems the more suitable; namely, that God would limit his promise, lest
Esau should be too much exalted: for nothing is more desirable than peace. The
holy people also are warned that there will always be some enemies to infest
them. This, however, is a very different thing from living by his own sword;
which is as if he had said, that the sons of Esau, like robbers, should maintain
their security by arms and violence, rather than by legitimate authority. A
second limitation of the promise is, that though armed with the sword, he should
still not escape subjection to his brother. For the Idumeans were, at length,
made tributary to the chosen people; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F503</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but the servitude was not long continued; because when the kingdoms were
divided, the power by which they had held all their neighbors in subjection and
fear, was cut off; yet the Lord would have the Idumeans brought into subjection
for a short time, that he might furnish a visible demonstration of this
prophecy. As to the rest of the time, the restless and unbridled liberty of Esau
was more wretched than any state of
subjection.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>41.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Esau hated
Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It hence appears more clearly, that the
tears of Esau were so far from being the effect of true repentance, that they
were rather evidences of furious anger. For he is not content with secretly
cherishing enmity against his brother, but openly breaks out in wicked threats.
And it is evident how deeply malice had struck its roots, when he could indulge
himself in the desperate purpose of murdering his brother. Even a profane and
sacrilegious contumacy betrays itself in him, seeing that he prepares himself to
abolish the decree of God by the sword. I will take care, he says, that Jacob
shall not enjoy the inheritance promised to him. What is this but to annihilate
the force of the benediction, of which he knew that his father was the herald
and the minister? Moreover, a lively picture of a hypocrite is here set before
us. He pretends that the death of his father would be to him a mournful event:
and doubtless it is a religious duty to mourn over a deceased father. But it was
a mere pretense on his part, to speak of the day of mourning, when in his haste
to execute the impious murder of his brother, the death of his father seemed to
come too slowly, and he rejoiced at the prospect of its approach. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F504</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
With what face could he ever pretend to any human affection, when he gasps for
his brother's death, and at the same time attempts to subvert all the laws of
nature? It is even possible, that an impulse of nature itself, extorted from him
the avowal, by which he would the more grievously condemn himself; as God often
censures the wicked out of their own mouth, and renders them more inexcusable.
But if a sense of shame alone restrains a cruel mind, this is not to be deemed
worthy of great praise; nay, it even betrays a stupid and brutal contempt of
God. Sometimes, indeed, the fear of man influences even the pious, as we have
seen, in the preceding chapter,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
26:1, respecting Jacob: but they soon rise above it, so that with them the fear
of God predominates; while forgetfulness of God so pervades the hearts of the
wicked, that they rest their hopes in men alone. Therefore, he who abstains from
wickedness merely through the fear of man, and from a sense of shame, has
hitherto made but little progress. Yet the confession of the Papists is chiefly
honored by them with this praise, that it deters many from sin, through the fear
lest they should be compelled to proclaim their own disgrace. But the rule of
piety is altogether different, since it teaches our conscience to set God before
us as our witness and our judge.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>42.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And these words of Esau... .
were told to Rebekah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses now makes a
transition to a new subject of history, showing how Jacob, as a wanderer from
his father's house, went into Mesopotamia. Without doubt, it was an exceedingly
troublesome and severe temptation to the holy matron, to see that, by her own
deed, her son was placed in imminent danger of death. But by faith she wrestled
to retain the possession of the grace once received. For, if she had been
impelled by a merely womanly attachment to her younger son, it certainly would
have been her best and shortest method, to cause the birthright to be restored
to Esau: for thus the cause of emulation would have been removed; and he who was
burning with grief at the loss of his right, would have had his fury appeased.
It is therefore an evidence of extraordinary faith, that Rebekah does not come
to any agreement, but persuades her son to become a voluntary exile, and chooses
rather to be deprived of his presence, than that he should give up the blessing
he had once received. The benediction of the father might now seem illusory; so
as to make it appear wonderful that so much should be made of it by Rebekah and
Jacob: nevertheless, they were so far from repenting of what they had done, that
they do not refuse the bitter punishment of exile, if only Jacob may carry with
him the benediction uttered by his father. Moreover, we are taught by this
example, that we must bear it patiently, if the cross attends the hope of a
better life, as its companion; or even if the Lord adopts us into his family,
with this condition, that we should wander as pilgrims without any certain
dwelling-place in the world. For, on this account, Jacob is thrust out from his
paternal home, where he might quietly have passed his life, and is compelled to
migrate to a strange land; because the blessing of God is promised unto him. And
as he did not attempt to purchase temporal peace with his brother by the loss of
the grace received; so must we beware lest any carnal advantage or any
allurements of the world should draw us aside from the course of our vocation:
let us rather bear with magnanimity losses of all kinds, so that the anchor of
our hope nay remain fixed in heaven. When Rebekah says that Esau consoled
himself with the thought, that he would slay his brother; the meaning is, that
he could not be pacified by any other means, than by this wicked
murder</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>44.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And tarry with him a few
days</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This circumstance mitigates the severity
of banishment. For the shortness of the time of suffering avails not a little to
support us in adversity. And it was probable that the enmity of Esau would not
prove so obstinate as to be unassuaged by his brother's absence. In the Hebrew
expression which is translated "a few days," the word few is literally "one" put
in the plural number. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F505</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Rebekah means, that as soon as Jacob should have gone away of his own accord,
the memory of the offense would be obliterated from the mind of Esau; as if she
had said, Only depart hence for a little while, and we shall soon assuage his
anger.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>45.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why should I be deprived of
you both in one day</i></font><font face="Palatino">? Why does Rebekah fear a
double privation? for there was no danger that Jacob, endued with a disposition
so mild and placid, should rise up against his brother. We see, therefore, that
Rebekah concluded that God would be the avenger of the iniquitous murder.
Moreover, although God, for a time, might seem to overlook the deed, and to
suspend his judgment, it would yet be necessary for him to withdraw from the
parricide. Therefore, by this law of nature, Rebekah declares that she should be
entirely bereaved; because she would be compelled to dread and to detest him who
survived. But if Rebekah anticipated in her mind what the judgment of God would
be, and devoted the murderer to destruction, because she was persuaded that
wickedness so great would not be unpunished; much less ought we to close our
eyes against the manifest chastisements of God. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F506</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>46.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Rebekah said to
Isaac</i></font><font face="Palatino">. When Jacob might have fled secretly, his
mother, nevertheless, obtains leave for his departure from his father; for so a
well-ordered domestic government and discipline required. In giving another
cause than the true one to her husband, she may be excused from the charge of
falsehood; inasmuch as she neither said the whole truth nor left the whole
unsaid. No doubt, she truly affirms that she was tormented, even to weariness of
life, on account of her Hittite daughters-in-law: but she prudently conceals the
more inward evil, lest she should inflict a mortal wound on her husband: and
also, lest she should the more influence the rage of Esau; for the wicked,
often, when their crime is detected, are the more carried away with desperation.
Now, although in consequence of the evil manners of her daughters-in-law,
affinity with the whole race became hateful to Rebekah, yet in this again the
wonderful providence of God is conspicuous, that Jacob neither blended, nor
entangled himself, with the future enemies of the Church.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Isaac called Jacob, and
blessed him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It may be asked, whether the
reason why Isaac repeats anew the benediction which he had before pronounced,
was that the former one had been of no force; whereas, if he was a prophet and
interpreter of the will of God, what had once proceeded from his mouth ought to
have been firm and perpetual. I answer, although the benedictions was in itself
efficacious, yet the faith of Jacob required support of this kind: just as the
Lord, in reiterating, frequently the same promises, derogates nothing either
from himself or from his word, but rather confirms the certainty of that word to
his servants, lest, at any time, their confidence should be shaken through the
infirmity of the flesh. What I have said must also be kept in mind, that Isaac
prayed, not as a private person, but as one furnished with a special command of
God, to transmit the covenant deposited with himself to his son Jacob. It was
also of the greatest importance that now, at length, Jacob should be blessed by
his father, knowingly and willingly; lest at a future time a doubt, arising from
the recollection of his father's mistake and of his own fraud, might steal over
his mind. Therefore Isaac, now purposely directing his words to his son Jacob,
pronounces the blessing to be due to him by right, lest it should be thought
that, having been before deceived, he had uttered words in vain, under a false
character.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Arise, go to
Padan-aram</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In the first place, he commands him
to take a wife from his maternal race. He might have sent for her by some one of
his servants, as Rebekah had been brought to him; but perhaps he took this
course to avoid the envy of Esau, who might regard it as a reproach if more
solicitude were manifested about his brother's marriage than about his
own.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And God Almighty bless
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here follows the form of benediction,
which slightly differs in words from the former, but nevertheless tends to the
same end. First, he desires that Jacob should be blessed by God; that is, that
he should be so increased and amplified in his own offspring, as to grow into a
multitude of nations; or, in other words, that he should produce many people who
might combine into one body under the same head; as if he had said, Let there
arise from thee many tribes, who shall constitute one people. And this truly
was, in some measure, fulfilled when Moses distributed the people into thirteen
divisions. Nevertheless, Isaac looked for a further result, namely, that many
were at length to be gathered together out of various nations, to the family of
his son, that, in this manner, from a vast and previously scattered multitude,
might be formed one assembly. For it is not to be doubted, that he wished to
hand down what he had received; seeing that he immediately afterwards celebrates
the memory of the original covenant, deriving his present benediction from
thence as its source: as if he had said, that he transferred whatever right he
had from his father; to his son Jacob, in order that the inheritance of life
might remain with him, according to the covenant of God made with Abraham. They
who expound this as being said in the way of comparison, as if Isaac 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F507</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
wished those benefits which God had before conferred on Abraham to be in the
same manner granted to his son, attenuate the meaning of the words. For since
God, in making his covenant with Abraham, had annexed this condition, that it
should descend to his posterity, it was necessary to trace its commencement to
his person as its root. Therefore, Isaac constitutes his son Jacob the heir of
Abraham, as successor to the benediction deposited with him, and promised to his
seed. This also appears more clearly from the context following, where he
assigns to him the dominion over the land, because it had been given to Abraham.
Moreover, we perceive, in this member of the sentence, with what consistency of
faith the holy fathers rested on the word of the Lord; for otherwise, they would
have found it no small temptation to be driven about as strangers and pilgrims
in the very land, the possession of which had been divinely assigned them a
hundred years before. But we see, that in their wanderings and their unsettled
mode of life, they no less highly estimated what God had promised them, than if
they had already been in the full enjoyment of it. And this is the true trial of
faith; when relying on the word of God alone, although tossed on the waves of
the world, we stand as firmly as if our abode were already fixed in heaven.
Isaac expressly fortifies his son against this temptation, when he calls the
land of which he constitutes him lord, the land of his wanderings. For by these
words he teaches him that it was possible he might be a wanderer all the days of
his life: but this did not hinder the promise of God from being so ratified,
that he, contented with that alone, might patiently wait for the time of
revelation. Even the plural number 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F508</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
seems to express something significant, namely, that Jacob would be a wanderer
not once only, but in various ways and perpetually. Since, however, the Hebrew
plural has not always such emphasis, I do not insist on this interpretation. It
is more worthy of notice, that the faith of Jacob was proved by a severe and
rigid trial, seeing, that for this very reason, the land is promised to him in
<i>word</i> only, while in <i>fact</i>, he is cast far away from it. For he
seems to be the object of ridicule, when he is commanded to possess the dominion
of the land, and yet to leave it and to bid it farewell, and to depart into
distant exile.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When Esau
saw</i></font><font face="Palatino">. A brief narration concerning Esau is here
inserted, which it is useful to know; because we learn from it that the wicked,
though they exalt themselves against God, and though, in contempt of his grace,
they please themselves in obtaining their desires, are yet not able to despise
that grace altogether. So now, Esau is penetrated with a desire of the blessing;
not that he aspires to it sincerely and from his heart; but perceiving it to be
something valuable, he is impelled to seek after it, though with reluctance. A
further fault is, that he does not seek it as he ought: for he devises a new and
strange method of reconciling God and his father to himself; and therefore all
his diligence is without profit. At the same time he does not seem to be careful
about pleasing God, so that he may but propitiate his father. Before all things,
it was his duty to cast aside his profane disposition, his perverse manners, and
his corrupt affections of the flesh, and then to bear with meekness the
chastisement inflicted upon him: for genuine repentance would have dictated to
him this sentiment, Seeing I have hitherto rendered myself unworthy of the
birthright, my brother is deservedly preferred before me. Nothing, therefore,
remains for me but to humble myself, and since I am deprived of the honor of
being the head, let it suffice me to be at least one of the members of the
Church. And, certainly, it would have been more desirable for him to remain in
some obscure corner of the Church, than, as one cut off and torn away from the
elect people, to shine with a proud preeminence on earth. He aims, however, at
nothing of this kind, but attempts, by I know not what prevarications, to
appease his father in whatever way he may be able. Moses, in this example,
depicts all hypocrites to the life. For as often as the judgment of God urges
them, though they are wounded with the pain of their punishment, they yet do not
seek a true remedy; for having aimed at offering one kind of satisfaction only,
they entirely neglect a simple and real conversion: and even in the satisfaction
offered, they only make a pretense. Whereas Esau ought thoroughly to have
repented, he only tried to correct the single fault of his marriage; and this
too in a most absurd manner. Yet another defect follows: for while he retains
the wives who were so hateful to his parents, he supposes he has discharged his
duty by marrying a third. But by this method, neither was the trouble of his
parents alleviated, nor his house cleansed from guilt. And now truly, whence
does he marry his third wife? From the race of Ishmael, whom we know to have
been himself degenerate, and whose posterity had departed from the pure worship
of God. A remarkable proof of this is discernible at the present day, in the
pretended and perfidious intermeddlers, who imagine they can admirably adjust
religious differences by simply adorning their too gross corruptions with
attractive colors. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F509</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The actual state of things compels them to confess that the vile errors and
abuses of Popery have so far prevailed as to render a Reformation absolutely
necessary: but they are unwilling that the filth of this Camarine marsh be
stirred; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F510</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
they only desire to conceal its impurities, and even that they do by compulsion.
For they had previously called their abominations the sacred worship of God; but
since these are now dragged to light by the word of God, they therefore descend
to novel artifices. They flatter themselves, however; in vain, seeing they are
here condemned by Moses, in the person of Esau. Away, then, with their impure
pretended reformation, which has nothing simple nor sincere. Moreover, since it
is a disease inherent in the human race, willingly to attempt to deceive God by
some fictitious pretext, let us know that we do nothing effectually, until we
tear up our sins by the roots, and thoroughly devote ourselves to
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob went
out</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In the course of this history we must
especially observe, how the Lord preserved his own Church in the person of one
man. For Isaac, on account of his age, lay like a dry trunk; and although the
living root of piety was concealed within his breast, yet no hope of further
offspring remained in his exhausted and barren old age. Esau, like a green and
flourishing branch, had much of show and splendor, but his vigor was only
momentary. Jacob, as a severed twig, was removed into a far distant land; not
that, being ingrafted or planted there, he should acquire strength and
greatness, but that, being moistened with the dew of heaven, he might put forth
his shoots as into the air itself. For the Lord wonderfully nourishes him, and
supplies him with strength, until he shall bring him back again to his father's
house. Meanwhile, let the reader diligently observe, that while he who was
blessed by God is cast into exile; occasion of glorying was given to the
reprobate Esau, who was left in the possession of everything, so that he might
securely reign without a rival. Let us not, then, be disturbed, if at any time
the wicked sound their triumphs, as having gained their wishes, while we are
oppressed. Moses mentions the name of Beersheba, because, as it formed one of
the boundaries of the land of Canaan, and lay towards the great desert and the
south, it was the more remote from the eastern region towards which Jacob was
going. He afterwards adds Charran,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
29:1,) where Abraham, when he left his own country, dwelt for some time. Now, it
appears that not only the pious old man Terah, when he followed his son, or
accompanied him on his journey, came to Charran where he died; but that his
other son Nahor, with his family, also came to the same place. For we read in
the eleventh chapter
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
11:1,) that Terah took his son Abraham, and Lot his grandson, and Sarai his
daughter-in-law. Whence we infer that Nahor, at that time, remained in Chaldea,
his native country. But now, since Moses says, that Laban dwelt at Charran, we
may hence conjecture, that Nahor, in order that he might not appear guilty of
the inhumanity of deserting his father, afterwards gathered together his goods
and came to him.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Moses here, in a few words,
declares what a severe and arduous journey the holy man (Jacob) had, on account
of its great length: to which also another circumstance is added; namely, that
he lay on the ground, under the open sky, without a companion, and without a
habitation. But as Moses only briefly alludes to these facts, so will I also
avoid prolixity, as the thing speaks for itself. Wherefore, if, at any time, we
think ourselves to be roughly treated, let us remember the example of the holy
man, as a reproof to our fastidiousness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he
dreamed</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses here teaches how opportunely,
and (as we may say) in the critical moment, the Lord succoured his servant. For
who would not have said that holy Jacob was neglected by God, since he was
exposed to the incursion of wild beasts, and obnoxious to every kind of injury
from earth and heaven, and found nowhere any help or solace? But when he was
thus reduced to the last necessity, the Lord suddenly stretches out his hand to
him, and wonderfully alleviates his trouble by a remarkable oracle. As,
therefore, Jacob's invincible perseverance had before shone forth, so now the
Lord gives a memorable example of his paternal care towards the faithful. Three
things are here to be noticed in their order; first, that the Lord appeared unto
Jacob in a dream; secondly, the nature of the vision as described by Moses;
thirdly, the words of the oracle. When mention is made of a dream, no doubt that
mode of revelation is signified, which the Lord formerly was wont to adopt
towards his servants.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;041206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
12:6.) Jacob, therefore, knew that this dream was divinely sent to him, as one
differing from common dreams; and this is intimated in the words of Moses, when
he says that God appeared to him in a dream. For Jacob could not see God, nor
perceive him present, unless his majesty had been distinguishable by certain
marks.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And behold a
ladder</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here the <i>form</i> of the vision is
related, which is very pertinent to the subject of it; namely, that God
manifested himself as seated upon a ladder, the extreme parts of which touched
heaven and earth, and which was the vehicle of angels, who descended from heaven
upon earth. The interpretation of some of the Hebrews, that the ladder is a
figure of the Divine Providence, cannot be admitted: for the Lord has given
another sign more suitable. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F511</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But to us, who hold to this principle, that the covenant of God was founded in
Christ, and that Christ himself was the eternal image of the Father, in which he
manifested himself to the holy patriarchs, there is nothing in this vision
intricate or ambiguous. For since men are alienated from God by sin, though he
fills and sustains all things by his power; yet that communication by which he
would draw us to himself is not perceived by us; but, on the other hand, so
greatly are we at variance with him, that, regarding him as adverse to us, we,
in our turn, flee from his presence. Moreover the angels, to whom is committed
the guardianship of the human race, while strenuously applying themselves to
their office, yet do not communicate with us in such a way that we become
conscious of their presence. It is Christ alone, therefore, who connects heaven
and earth: he is the only Mediator who reaches from heaven down to earth: he is
the medium through which the fullness of all celestial blessings flows down to
us, and through which we, in turn, ascend to God. He it is who, being the head
over angels, causes them to minister to his earthly members. Therefore, (as we
read in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430151&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
1:51,) he properly claims for himself this honor, that after he shall have been
manifested in the world, angels shall ascend and descend. If, then, we say that
the ladder is a figure of Christ, the exposition will not be forced. For the
similitude of a ladder well suits the Mediator, through whom ministering angels,
righteousness and life, with all the graces of the Holy Spirit, descend to us
step by step. We also, who were not only fixed to the earth, but plunged into
the depths of the curse, and into hell itself, ascend even unto God. Also, the
God of hosts is seated on the ladder; because the fullness of the Deity dwells
in Christ; and hence also it is, that it reaches unto heaven. For although all
power is committed even to his human nature by the Father, he still would not
truly sustain our faith, unless he were God manifested in the flesh. And the
fact that the body of Christ is finite, does not prevent him from filling heaven
and earth, because his grace and power are everywhere diffused. Whence also,
Paul being witness, he ascended into heaven that he might fill all things. They
who translate the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l[</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>al</i>) by the word "near," entirely destroy the sense of the passage. For
Moses wishes to state that the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in the person of
the Mediator. Christ not only approached unto us, but clothed himself in our
nature, that he might make us one with himself. That the ladder was a symbol of
Christ, is also confirmed by this consideration, that nothing was more suitable
than that God should ratify his covenant of eternal salvation in his Son to his
servant Jacob. And hence we feel unspeakable joy, when we hear that Christ, who
so far excels all creatures, is nevertheless joined with us. The majesty,
indeed, of God, which here presents itself conspicuously to view, ought to
inspire terror; so that every knee should bow to Christ, that all creatures
should look up to him and adore him, and that all flesh should keep silence in
his presence. But his friendly and lovely image is at the same time depicted;
that we may know by his descent, that heaven is opened to us, and the angels of
God are rendered familiar to us. For hence we have fraternal society with them,
since the common Head both of them and us has his station on
earth.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am the Lord God of
Abraham</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is the third point which, I said,
was to be noticed: for mute visions are cold; therefore the word of the Lord is
as the soul which quickens them. The figure, therefore, of the ladder was the
inferior appendage of this promise; just as God illustrates and adorns his word
by external symbols, that both greater clearness and authority may be added to
it. Whence also we prove that sacraments in the Papacy are frivolous, because no
voice is heard in them which may edify the soul. We may therefore observe, that
whenever God manifested himself to the fathers, he also spoke, lest a mute
vision should have held them in suspense. Under the name
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hwhy
</font><font face="Palatino"><i>Jehovah</i> God teaches that he is the only
Creator of the world, that Jacob might not seek after other gods. But since his
majesty is in itself incomprehensible, he accommodates himself to the capacity
of his servant, by immediately adding, that he is the God of Abraham and Isaac.
For though it is necessary to maintain that the God whom we worship is the only
God; yet because when our senses would aspire to the comprehension of his
greatness, they fail at the first attempt; we must diligently cultivate that
sobriety which teaches us not to desire to know more concerning him than he
reveals unto us; and then he, accommodating himself to our weakness, according
to his infinite goodness, sill omit nothing which tends to promote our
salvation. And whereas he made a special covenant with Abraham and Isaac,
proclaiming himself their God, he recalls his servant Jacob to the true source
of faith, and retains him also in his perpetual covenant. This is the sacred
bond of religion, by which all the sons of God are united among themselves, when
from the first to the last they hear the same promise of salvation, and agree
together in one common hope. And this is the effect of that benediction which
Jacob had lately received from his father; because God with his own mouth
pronounces him to be the heir of the covenant, lest the mere testimony of man
should be thought
illusive.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The land whereon
thou liest</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We read that the land was given to
his posterity; yet he himself was not only a stranger in it to the last, but was
not permitted even to die there. Whence we infer, that under the pledge or
earnest of the land, something better and more excellent was given, seeing that
Abraham was a spiritual possessor of the land, and contented with the mere
beholding of it, fixed his chief regard on heaven. We, may observe, however,
that the seed of Jacob is here placed in opposition to the other sons of
Abraham, who, according to the flesh, traced their origin to him, but were cut
off from the holy people: yet, from the time when the sons of Jacob entered the
land of Canaan, they had the perpetual inheritance unto the coming of Christ, by
whose advent the world was renewed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And thy seed shall be as the
dust of the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The sum of the whole is
this, Whatever the Lord had promised to Abraham, Jacob transmitted to his sons.
Meanwhile it behoved the holy man, in reliance on this divine testimony, to hope
against hope; for though the promise was vast and magnificent, yet, wherever
Jacob turned himself, no ray of good hope shone upon him. He saw himself a
solitary man; no condition better than that of exile presented itself; his
return was uncertain and full of danger; but it was profitable for him to be
thus left destitute of all means of help, that he might learn to depend on the
word of God alone. Thus, at the present time, if God freely promises to give us
all things, and yet seems to approach us empty-handed, it is still proper that
we should pay such honor and reverence to his word, that we may be enriched and
filled with faith. At length, indeed, after the death of Jacob, the event
declared how efficacious had been this promise: by which example we are taught
that the Lord by no means disappoints his people, even when he defers the
granting of those good things which he has promised, till after their
death.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And in thee, and in thy
seed, shall all the families of the earth be
blessed</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F512</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This clause has the greater weight, because in Jacob and in his seed the
blessing is to be restored from which the whole human race had been cut off in
their first parent. But what this expression means, I have explained above;
namely, that Jacob will not only be an exemplar, or <i>formula</i> of blessing,
but its fountain, cause, or foundation; for though a certain exquisite degree of
happiness is often signified by an expression of this kind; yet, in many
passages of Scripture, it means the same as to desire from any one his blessing,
and to acknowledge it as his gift. Thus men are said to bless themselves in God,
when they acknowledge him as the author of all good. So here God promises that
in Jacob and his seed all nations shall bless themselves, because no happiness
will ever be found except what proceeds from this source. That, however, which
is peculiar to Christ, is without impropriety transferred to Jacob, in whose
loins Christ then was. Therefore, inasmuch as Jacob, at that time, represented
the person of Christ, it is said that all nations are to be blessed in him; but,
seeing that the manifestation of a benefit so great depended on another, the
expression <i>in thy seed</i> is immediately added in the way of explanation.
That the word seed is a collective noun, forms no objection to this
interpretation, (as I have elsewhere said,) for since all unbelievers deprive
themselves of honor and of grace, and are thus accounted strangers; it is
necessary to refer to the Head, in order that the unity of the seed may appear.
Whoever will reverently ponder this, will easily see that, in this
interpretation, which is that of Paul, there is nothing tortuous or
constrained.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am with thee, and will keep
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. God now promptly anticipates the
temptation which might steal over the mind of holy Jacob; for though he is, for
a time, thrust out into a foreign land, God declares that he will be his keeper
until he shall have brought him back again. He then extends his promise still
further; saying, that he will never desert him till all things are fulfilled.
There was a twofold use of this promise: first, it retained his mind in the
faith of the divine covenant; and, secondly, it taught him that it could not be
well with him unless he were a partaker of the promised
inheritance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob
awaked</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses again affirms that this was no
common dream; for when any one awakes he immediately perceives that he had been
under a delusions in dreaming. But God impressed a sign on the mind of his
servant, by which, when he awoke, he might recognize the heavenly oracle which
he had heard in his sleep. Moreover, Jacob, in express terms, accuses himself,
and extols the goodness of God, who deigned to present himself to one who sought
him not; for Jacob thought that he was there alone: but now, after the Lord
appeared, he wonders, and exclaims that he had obtained more than he could have
dared to hope for. It is not, however, to be doubted that Jacob had called upon
God, and had trusted that he would be the guide of his journey; but, because his
faith had not availed to persuade him that God was thus near unto him, he justly
extols this act of grace. So, whenever God anticipates our wishes, and grants us
more than our minds have conceived; let us learn, after the example of this
patriarch, to wonder that God should have been present with us. Now, if each of
us would reflect how feeble his faith is, this mode of speaking would appear
always proper for us all; for who can comprehend, in his scanty measure, the
immense multitude of gifts which God is perpetually heaping upon
us?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he was afraid, and
said</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It seems surprising that Jacob should
fear, when God spoke so graciously to him; or that he should call that place
"dreadful," where he had been filled with incredible joy. I answer, although God
exhilarates his servants, he at the same time inspires them with fear, in order
that they may learn, with true humility and self-denial, to embrace his mercy.
We are not therefore to understand that Jacob was struck with terror, as
reprobates are, as soon as God shows himself; but he was inspired with a fear
which produces pious submission. He also properly calls that place the<i> gate
of heaven</i>, on account of the manifestation of God: for, because God is
placed in heaven as on his royal throne, Jacob truly declares that, in seeing
God, he had penetrated into heaven. In this sense the preaching of the gospel is
called the kingdom of heaven, and the sacraments may be called the gate of
heaven, because they admit us into the presence of God. The Papists, however,
foolishly misapply this passage to their temples, as if God dwelt in filthy
places. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F513</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But if we concede, that the places which they designate by this title, are not
polluted with impious superstitions, yet this honor belongs to no peculiar
place, since Christ has filled the whole world with the presence of his Deity.
Those helps to faith only, (as I have before taught,) by which God raises us to
himself, can be called the gates of
heaven.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob rose up
early</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses relates that the holy father was
not satisfied with merely giving thanks at the time, but would also transmit a
memorial of his gratitude to posterity. Therefore he raised a monument, and gave
a name to the place, which implied that he thought such a signal benefit of God
worthy to be celebrated in all ages. For this reason, the Scripture not only
commands the faithful to sing the praises of God among their brethren; but also
enjoins them to train their children to religious duties, and to propagate the
worship of God among their
descendants.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And set it up for
a pillar</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses does not mean that the stone
was made an idol, but that it should be a special memorial. God indeed uses this
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hbxm</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>matsbah</i>,) when he forbids statues to be erected to himself,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;032601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
26:1,) because almost all statues were objects of veneration, as if they were
likenesses of God. But the design of Jacob was different; namely, that he might
leave a testimony of the vision which had appeared unto him, not that he might
represent God by that symbol or figure. Therefore the stone was not there placed
by him, for the purpose of depressing the minds of men into any gross
superstition, but rather of raising them upward. He used oil as a sign of
consecration, and not without reason; for as, in the world, everything is
profane which is destitute of the Spirit of God, so there is no pure religion
except that which the heavenly unction sanctifies. And to this point the solemn
right of consecration, which God commanded in his law, tends, in order that the
faithful may learn to bring in nothing of their own, lest they should pollute
the temple and worship of God. And though, in the times of Jacob, no teaching
had yet been committed to writing; it is, nevertheless, certain that he had been
imbued with that principle of piety which God from the beginning had infused
into the hearts of the devout: wherefore, it is not to be ascribed to
superstition that he poured oil upon the stone; but he rather testified, as I
have said, that no worship can be acceptable to God, or pure, without the
sanctification of the Spirit. Other commentators argue, with more subtlety, that
the stone was a symbol of Christ, on whom all the graces of the Spirit were
poured out, that all might draw out of his fullness; but I do not know that any
such thing entered the mind of Moses or of Jacob. I am satisfied with what I
have before stated, that a stone was erected to be a witness or a memorial (so
to speak) of a vision, the benefit of which reaches to all ages. It may be
asked, Whence did the holy man obtain oil in the desert? They who answer that it
had been brought from a neighboring city are, in my opinion, greatly deceived;
for this place was then void of inhabitants, as I shall soon show. I therefore
rather conjecture, that on account of the necessity of the times, seeing that
suitable accommodations could not always be had, he had taken some portion of
food for his journey along with him; and as we know that great use was made of
oil in those parts, it is no wonder if he carried a flagon of oil with his
bread.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he called the name of
that place Beth-el</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It may appear absurd that
Moses should speak of that place as a city, respecting which he had a little
while before said that Jacob had slept there in the open air; for why did not he
seek an abode, or hide himself in some corner of a house? But the difficulty is
easily solved, because the city was not yet built; neither did the place
immediately take the name which Jacob had assigned, but lay long concealed. Even
when a town was afterwards built on the spot, no mention is made of Beth-el, as
if Jacob had never passed that way; for the inhabitants did not know what had
been done there, and therefore they called the city Luz, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F514</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
according to their own imagination; which name it retained until the Israelites,
having taken possession of the land, recalled into common use, as by an act of
restoration, the former name which had been abolished. And it is to be observed,
that when posterity, by a foolish emulation, worshipped God in Beth-el, seeing
that it was done without a divine command, the prophets severely inveighed
against that worship, calling the name of the place Bethaven, that is, the house
of iniquity: whence we infer how unsafe it is to rely upon the examples of the
fathers without the word of God. The greatest care, therefore, must be taken, in
treating of the worship of God, that what has been once done by men, should not
be drawn into a precedent; but that what God himself has prescribed in his word
should remain an inflexible rule.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob vowed a
vow</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The design of this vow was, that Jacob
would manifest his gratitude, if God should prove favorable unto him. Thus they
offered peace-offerings under the law, to testify their gratitude; and since
thanksgiving is a sacrifice of a sweet odour, the Lord declares vows of this
nature to be acceptable to him; and therefore we must also have respect to this
point, when we are asked <i>what</i> and <i>how</i> it is lawful to vow to God;
for some are too fastidious, who would utterly condemn all vows rather than open
the door to superstitions. But if the rashness of those persons is perverse, who
indiscriminately pour forth their vows, we must also beware lest we become like
those on the opposite side, who disallow all vows without exception. Now, in
order that a vow may be lawful and pleasing to God, it is first necessary that
it should tend to a right end; and next, that men should devote nothing by a vow
but what is in itself approved by God, and what he has placed within their own
power. When the separate parts of this vow are examined, we shall see holy Jacob
so regulating his conduct as to omit none of these things which I have
mentioned. In the first place, he has nothing else in his mind than to testify
his gratitude. Secondly, he confines whatever he is about to do, to the lawful
worship of God. Inthe third place, he does not proudly promise what he had not
the power to perform, but devotes the tithe of his goods as a sacred oblation.
Wherefore, the folly of the Papists is easily refuted; who, in order to justify
their own confused farrago of vows, catch at one or another vow, soberly
conceived, as a precedent, when in the meantime their own license exceeds all
bounds. Whatever comes uppermost they are not ashamed to obtrude upon God. One
man makes his worship to consist in abstinence from flesh, another in
pilgrimages, a third in sanctifyingcertain days by the use of sackcloth, or by
other things of the same kind; and not to God only do they make their vows, but
also admit any dead person they please into a participation of this honor. They
arrogate to themselves the choice of perpetual celibacy. What do they find in
the example of Jacob which has any similitude or affinity to such rashness, that
they should hence catch at such a covering for themselves? But, for the purpose
of bringing all these things clearly to light, we must first enter upon an
explanation of the words. It may seem absurd that Jacob here makes a covenant
with God, to be his worshipper, if he will give him what he desires; as if truly
he did not intend to worship God for nothing. I answer, that, by interposing
this condition, Jacob did not by any means act from distrust, as if he doubted
of God's continual protection; but that in this manner made provision against
his own infirmity, in preparing himself to celebrate the divine goodness by a
vow previously made. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F515</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The superstitious deal with God just as they do with mortal man; they try to
soothe him with their allurements. The design of Jacob was far different;
namely, that he might the more effectually stimulate himself to the duties of
religion. He had often heard from the mouth of God, I will be always with thee;
and he annexes his vow as an appendage to that promise. He seems indeed, at
first sight, like a mercenary, acting in a servile manner; but since he depends
entirely upon the promises given unto him, and forms both his language and his
affections in accordance with them, he aims at nothing but the confirmation of
his faith, and gathers together those aids which he knows to be suitable to his
infirmity. When, therefore, he speaks of food and clothing, we must not, on that
account, accuse him of solicitude respecting this earthly life alone; whereas he
rather contends, like a valiant champion, against violent temptations. He found
himself in want of all things; hunger and nakedness were continually threatening
him with death, not to mention his other innumerable dangers: therefore he arms
himself with confidence, that he might proceed through all difficulties and
obstacles, being fully assured that every kind of assistance was laid up for him
in the grace of God: for he confesses himself to be in extreme destitution, when
he says, If the Lord will supply me with food and raiment. It may nevertheless
be asked, since his grandfather Abraham had sent his servant with a splendid
retinue, with camels and precious ornaments; why does Isaac now send away his
son without a single companion, and almost without provisions? It is possible
that he was thus dismissed, that the mind of cruel Esau might be moved to
tenderness by a spectacle so miserable. Yet, in my judgment, another reason was
of greater weight; for Abraham, fearing lest his son Isaac should remain with
his relatives, took an oath from his servant that he would not suffer his son to
go into Mesopotamia. But now, since necessity compels holy Isaac to determine
differently for his son Jacob; he, at least, takes care not to do anything which
might retard his return. He therefore supplies him with no wealth, and with no
delicacies which might ensnare his mind, but purposely sends him away poor and
empty, that he might be the more ready to return. Thus we see that Jacob
preferred his father's house to all kingdoms, and had no desire of settled
repose elsewhere.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then shall the Lord be my
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In these words Jacob binds himself never
to apostatize from the pure worship of the One God; for there is no doubt that
he here comprises the sum of piety. But he may seem to promise what far exceeds
his strength; for newness of life, spiritual righteousness, integrity of heart,
and a holy regulation of the whole life, were not in his own power. I answer,
when holy men vow those things which God requires of them, and which are due
from them as acts of piety; they, at the same time, embrace what God promises
concerning the remission of sins by the help of his Holy Spirit. Hence it
follows that they ascribe nothing to their own strength; and also, that whatever
falls short of entire perfection does not vitiate their worship, because God,
mercifully and with paternal indulgence, pardons
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And this stone which I have
set for a pillar</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This ceremony was an
appendage to divine worship; for external rites do not make men true worshippers
of God, but are only aids to piety. But because the holy fathers were then at
liberty to erect altars wherever they pleased, Jacob poured a libation upon the
stone, because he had then no other sacrifice to offer; not that he worshipped
God according to his own will, (for the direction of the Spirit was instead of
the written law,) but he erected in that place a stone &#8212; as he was
permitted to do by the kindness and permission of God, which should be a
testimony of the vision. Moreover, this form of speech, that the stone shall be
Beth-el, is <i>metonymical</i>; as we are sanctioned, by common usage, to
transfer to external signs what properly belongs to the things represented. I
have lately shown how ignorantly posterity has abused this holy exercise of
piety. What next follows respecting the offering of tithes, is not a simple
ceremony, but has a duty of charity annexed; for Jacob enumerates, in a
threefold order, first, the spiritual worship of God; then the external rite, by
which he both assists his own piety, and makes profession of it before men; in
the third place, an oblation, by which he exercises himself in giving friendly
aid to his brethren; for there is no doubt that tithes were applied to that
use.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then Jacob went on his
journey</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F516</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Moses now relates the arrival of Jacob in Mesopotamia, and the manner in which
he was received by his uncle; and although the narration may seem superfluous,
it yet contains nothing but what is useful to be known; for he commends the
extraordinary strength of Jacob's faith, when he says, that he lifted up his
feet to come into an unknown land. Again, he would have us to consider the
providence of God, which caused Jacob to fall in with the shepherds, by whom he
was conducted to the home he sought; for this did not happen accidentally, but
he was guided by the hidden hand of God to that place; and the shepherds, who
were to instruct and confirm him respecting all things, were brought thither at
the same time. Therefore, whenever we may wander in uncertainty through
intricate windings, we must contemplate, with eyes of faith, the secret
providence of God which governs us and our affairs, and leads us to unexpected
results.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My brethren, whence be
ye?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The great frankness of that age appears in
this manner of meeting together; for, though the fraternal name is often abused
by dishonest and wicked men, it is yet not to be doubted that friendly
intercourse was then more faithfully cultivated than it is now. This was the
reason why Jacob salutes unknown men as brethren, undoubtedly according to
received custom. Frugality also is apparent, in that Rachel sometimes pays
attention to the flock; for, since Laban abounds with servants, how does it
happen that he employs his own daughter in a vile and sordid service, except
that it was deemed disgraceful to educate children in idleness, softness, and
indulgence? Whereas, on the contrary, at this day, since ambition, pride, and
refinement, have rendered manners effeminate, the care of domestic concerns is
held in such contempt, that women, for the most part, are ashamed of their
proper office. It followed, from the same purity of manners which has been
mentioned, that Jacob ventured so unceremoniously to kiss his cousin; for much
greater liberty was allowed in their chaste and modest mode of living. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F517</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In our times, impurity and ungovernable lusts are the cause why not only kisses
are suspected, but even looks are dreaded; and not unjustly, since the world is
filled with every kind of corruption, and such perfidy prevails, that the
intercourse between men and women is seldom conducted with modesty:
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F518</font></sup><font face="Palatino">wherefore,
that ancient simplicity ought to cause us deeply to mourn; so that this vile
corruption into which the world has fallen may be distasteful to us, and that
the contagion of it may not affect us and our families. The order of events,
however, is inverted in the narration of Moses; for Jacob did not kiss Rachel
till he had informed her that he was her relative. Hence also his weeping; for,
partly through joy, partly through the memory of his father's house, and through
natural affection, he burst into tears.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he told Laban all these
things</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Since Laban had previously seen one of
Abraham's servants replenished with great wealth, an unfavourable opinion of his
nephew might instantly enter into his mind: it was therefore necessary for holy
Jacob to explain the causes of his own departure, and the reason why he had been
sent away so contemptibly clothed. It is also probable that he had been
instructed by his mother respecting the signs and marks by which he might
convince them of his relationship: therefore Laban exclaims, Surely thou art my
bone and my flesh; intimating that he was fully satisfied, and that he was
induced by indubitable tokens to acknowledge Jacob as his nephew. This knowledge
inclines him to humanity; for the sense of nature dictates that they who are
united by ties of blood should endeavor to assist each other; but though the
bond between relatives is closer, yet our kindness ought to extend more widely,
so that it may diffuse itself through the whole human race. If, however, all the
sons of Adam are thus joined together, that spiritual relationship which God
produces between the faithful, and than which there is no holier bond of mutual
benevolence, ought to be much more
effectual.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he abode with him the
space of a month</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Though Laban did not doubt
that Jacob was his nephew by his sister, he nevertheless puts his character to
trial during a month, and then treats with him respecting wages. Hence may be
inferred the uprightness of the holy man; because he was not idle while with his
uncle, but employed himself in honest labors, that he might not in idleness eat
another's bread for nothing; hence Laban is compelled to acknowledge that some
reward beyond his mere food was due to him. When he says, "Because thou art my
brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought?" his meaning may be
twofold; either that it would be excessively absurd and unjust to defraud a
relation of his due reward, for whom he ought to have greater consideration than
for any stranger; or that he was unwilling to exact gratuitous service under the
color of relationship. This second exposition is the more suitable, and is
received nearly by the consent of all. For they read in one connected sentence,
"Because thou art my brother, shalt thou therefore serve me for nought?"
Moreover, we must note the end for which Moses relates these things. In the
first place, a great principle of equity is set before us in Laban; inasmuch as
this sentiment is inherent in almost all minds, that justice ought to be
mutually cultivated, till blind cupidity draws them away in another direction.
And God has engraven in man's nature a law of equity; so that whoever declines
from that rule, through an immoderate desire of private advantage, is left
utterly without excuse. But a little while after, when it came to a matter of
practice, Laban, forgetful of this equity, thinks only of what may be profitable
to himself. Such an example is certainly worthy of notice, for men seldom err in
general principles, and therefore, with one mouth, confess that every man ought
to receive what is his due but as soon as they descend to their own affairs,
perverse self-love blinds them, or at least envelopes them in such clouds that
they are carried in an opposite course. Wherefore, let us learn to restrain
ourselves, that a desire of our own advantage may not prevail to the sacrifice
of justice. And hence has arisen the proverb, that no one is a fit judge in his
own cause, because each, being unduly favorable to himself, becomes forgetful of
what is right. Wherefore, we must ask God to govern and restrain our affections
by a spirit of sound judgment. Laban, in wishing to enter into a covenant, does
what tends to avoid contentions and complaints. The ancient saying is known, "We
should deal lawfully with our friends, that we may not afterwards be obliged to
go to law with them." For, whence arise so many legal broils, except that every
one is more liberal towards himself, and more niggardly towards others than he
ought to be? Therefore, for the purpose of cherishing concord, firm compacts are
necessary, which may prevent injustice on one side or the
other.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will serve thee seven
years</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The iniquity of Laban betrays itself in
a moment; for it is a shameful barbarity to give his daughter, by way of reward,
in exchange for Jacob's services, making her the subject of a kind of barter. He
ought, on the other hand, not only to have assigned a portion to his daughter,
but also to have acted more liberally towards his future son-in-law. But under
the pretext of affinity, he defrauds him of the reward of his labor, the very
thing which he had before acknowledged to be unjust. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F519</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
We therefore perceive still more clearly what I have previously alluded to, that
although from their mother's womb men have a general notion of justice, yet as
soon as their own advantage presents itself to view, they become actually
unjust, unless the Lord reforms them by his Spirit. Moses does not here relate
something rare or unusual, but what is of most common occurrence. For though men
do not set their daughters to sale, yet the desire of gain hurries the greater
part so far away, that they prostitute their honor and sell their souls.
Further, it is not altogether to be deemed a fault that Jacob was rather
inclined to love Rachel; whether it was that Leah, on account of her tender
eyes, was less beautiful, or that she was pleasing only by the comeliness of her
eyes, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F520</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
while Rachel excelled her altogether in elegance of form. For we see how
naturally a secret kind of affection produces mutual love. Only excess is to be
guarded against, and so much the more diligently, because it is difficult so to
restrain affections of this kind, that they do not prevail to the stifling of
reason. Therefore he who shall be induced to choose a wife, because of the
elegance of her form, will not necessarily sin, provided reason always maintains
the ascendancy, and holds the wantonness of passion in subjection. Yet perhaps
Jacob sinned in being too self-indulgent, when he desired Rachel the younger
sister to be given to him, to the injury of the elder; and also, while yielding
to the desire of his own eyes, he undervalued the virtues of Leah: for this is a
very culpable want of self-government, when any one chooses a wife only for the
sake of her beauty, whereas excellence of disposition ought to be deemed of the
first importance. But the strength and ardor of his attachment manifests itself
in this, that he felt no weariness in the labor of seven years: but chastity was
also joined with it, so that he persevered, during this long period, with a
patient and quiet mind in the midst of so many labors. And here again the
integrity and continence of that age is apparent, because, though dwelling under
the same roof, and accustomed to familiar intercourse, Jacob yet conducted
himself with modesty, and abstained from all impropriety. Therefore, at the
close of the appointed time he said, "Give me my wife, that I may go in unto
her," by which he implies that she had been hitherto a pure
virgin.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Laban gathered
together</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses does not mean that a supper was
prepared for the whole people, but that many guests were invited, as is
customary in splendid nuptials; and there is no doubt that he applied himself
with the greater earnestness to adorn that feast, for the purpose of holding
Jacob bound by a sense of shame, so that he should not dare to depreciate the
marriage into which he had been deceived. We hence gather what, at that time,
was the religious observance connected with the marriage bed. For this was the
occasion of Jacob's deception that, out of regard for the modesty of brides,
they were led veiled into the chamber; but now, the ancient discipline being
rejected, men become almost brutal.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he said to
Laban</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Jacob rightly expostulates respecting
the fraud practiced upon him. And the answer of Laban, though it is not without
a pretext, yet forms no excuse for the fraud. It was not the custom to give the
younger daughters in marriage before the elder: and injustice would have been
done to the firstborn by disturbing this accustomed order. But he ought not, on
that account, craftily to have betrothed Rachel to Jacob, and then to have
substituted Leah in her place. He should rather have cautioned Jacob himself, in
time, to turn his thoughts to Leah, or else to refrain from marriage with either
of them. But we may learn from this, that wicked and deceitful men, when once
they have turned aside from truth, make no end of transgressing: meanwhile, they
always put forward some pretext for the purpose of freeing themselves from
blame. He had before acted unjustly toward his nephew in demanding seven years'
labor for his daughter; he had also unjustly set his daughter to sale, without
dowry, for the sake of gain; but the most unworthy deed of all was perfidiously
to deprive his nephew of his betrothed wife, to pervert the sacred laws of
marriage, and to leave nothing safe or sound. Yet we see him pretending that he
has an honorable defense for his conduct, because it was not the custom of the
country to prefer the younger to the
elder.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fulfil her
week</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Laban now is become callous in
wickedness, for he extorts other seven years from his nephew to allow him to
marry his other daughter. If he had had ten more daughters, he would have been
ready thus to dispose of them all: yea, of his own accord, he obtrudes his
daughter as an object of merchandise, thinking nothing of the disgrace of this
illicit sale, if only he may make it a source of gain. In this truly he
grievously sins, that he not only involves his nephew in polygamy, but pollutes
both him and his own daughters by incestuous nuptials. If by any means a wife is
not loved by her husband, it is better to repudiate her than that she should be
retained as a captive, and consumed with grief by the introduction of a second
wife. Therefore the Lord, by Malachi, pronounces divorce to be more tolerable
than polygamy.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;390214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
2:14.) Laban, blinded by avarice, so sets his daughters together, that they
spend their whole lives in mutual hostility. He also perverts all the laws of
nature by casting two sisters into one marriage-bed, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F521</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
so that the one is the competitor of the other. Since Moses sets these crimes
before the Israelites in the very commencement of their history, it is not for
them to be inflated by the sense of their nobility, so that they should boast of
their descent from holy fathers. For, however excellent Jacob might be, he had
no other offspring than that which sprung from an impure source; since, contrary
to nature, two sisters are mixed together in one bed; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F522</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in the mode of beasts; and two concubines are afterwards added to the mass. We
have seen indeed, above, that this license was too common among oriental
nations; but it was not allowable for men, at their own pleasure, to subvert, by
a depraved custom, the law of marriage divinely sanctioned from the beginning.
Therefore, Laban is, in every way, inexcusable. And although necessity may, in
some degree, excuse the fault of Jacob, it cannot altogether absolve him from
blame. For he might have dismissed Leah, because she had not been his lawful
wife: because the mutual consent of the man and the woman, respecting which
mistake is impossible, constitutes marriage. But Jacob reluctantly retains her
as his wife, from whom he was released and free, and thus doubles his fault by
polygamy, and trebles it by an incestuous marriage. Thus we see that the
inordinate love of Rachel, which had been once excited in his mind, was inflamed
to such a degree, that he possessed neither moderation nor judgment. With
respect to the words made use of, interpreters ascribe to them different
meanings. Some refer the demonstrative pronoun to the week; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F523</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
others to Leah, as if it had been said, that he should not have Rachel until he
had lived with her sister one week. But I rather explain it of Rachel, that he
should purchase a marriage with her by another seven years' service; not that
Laban deferred the nuptials to the end of that time, but that Jacob was
compelled to engage himself in a new
servitude.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he loved also Rachel more
than Leah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. No doubt Moses intended to exhibit
the sins of Jacob, that we might learn to fear, and to conform all our actions
to the sole rule of God's word. For if the holy patriarch fell so grievously,
who among us is secure from a similar fall, unless kept by the guardian care of
God? At the same time, it appears how dangerous it is to imitate the fathers
while we neglect the law of the Lord. And yet the foolish Papists so greatly
delight themselves in this imitation, that they do not scruple to observe, as a
law, whatever they find to have been practiced by the fathers. Besides which,
they own as fathers those who are worthy of such sons, so that any raving monk
is of more account with them than all the patriarchs. It was not without fault
on Leah's part that she was despised by her husband; and the Lord justly
chastised her, because she, being aware of her father's fraud, dishonorably
obtained possession of her sister's husband; but her fault forms no excuse for
Jacob's lust.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when the Lord
saw</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses here shows that Jacob's extravagant
love was corrected by the Lord; as the affections of the faithful, when they
become inordinate, are wont to be tamed by the rod. Rachel is loved, not without
wrong to her sister, to whom due honor is not given. The Lord, therefore,
interposes as her vindicator, and, by a suitable remedy, turns the mind of Jacob
into that direction, to which it had been most averse. This passage teaches us,
that offspring is a special gift of God; since the power of rendering one
fertile, and of cursing the womb of the other with barrenness, is expressly
ascribed to him. We must observe further, that the bringing forth of offspring
tends to conciliate husbands to their wives. Whence also the ancients have
called children by the name of <i>pledges</i>; because they avail, in no slight
degree, to increase and to cherish mutual love. When Moses asserts that Leah was
hated, his meaning is, that she was not loved so much as she ought to have been.
For she was not intolerable to Jacob, neither did he pursue her with hatred; but
Moses, by the use of this word, amplifies his fault, in not having discharged
the duty of a husband, and in not having treated her who was his first wife with
adequate kindness and honor. It is of importance carefully to notice this,
because many think they fulfill their duty if they do not break out into mortal
hatred. But we see that the Holy Spirit pronounces those as hated who are not
sufficiently loved; and we know, that men were created for this end, that they
should love one another. Therefore, none will be counted guiltless of the crime
of hatred before God, but he who embraces his neighbors with love. For not only
will a secret displeasure be accounted as hatred, but even that neglect of
brethren, and that cold charity which ever reigns in the world. But in
proportion as any one is more closely connected with another, must be the
endeavor to adhere to each other in a more sacred bond of affection. Moreover,
with respect to married persons, though they may not openly disagree, yet if
they are cold in their affection towards each other, this disgust is not far
removed from hatred.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>32.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>She called his name
Reuben</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses relates that Leah was not
ungrateful to God. And truly, I do not doubt, that the benefits of God were then
commonly more appreciated than they are now. For a profane stupor so occupies
the mind of nearly all men, that, like cattle, they swallow up whatever benefits
God, in his kindness, bestows upon them. Further, Leah not only acknowledges God
as the author of her fruitfulness; but also assigns as a reason, that her
affliction had been looked upon by the Lord, and a son had been given her who
should draw the affection of her husband to herself. Whence it appears probable,
that when she saw herself despised, she had recourse to prayer, in order that
she might receive more succor from heaven. For thanksgiving is a proof that
persons have previously exercised themselves in prayer; since they who hope for
nothing from God do, by their indolence, bury in oblivion all the favors he has
conferred upon them. Therefore, Leah inscribed on the person of her son 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F524</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
a memorial whereby she might stir herself up to offer praise to God. This
passage also teaches, that they who are unjustly despised by men are regarded by
the Lord. Hence it affords a singularly profitable consolation to the faithful;
who, as experience shows, are for the most part despised in the world. Whenever,
therefore, they are treated harshly and contumeliously by men, let them take
refuge in this thought, that God will be the more propitious to them. Leah
followed the same course in reference to her second son; for she gave him a name
which is derived from "hearing," 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F525</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to recall to her memory that her sighs had been heard by the Lord. Whence we
conjecture (as I have just before said) that when affliction was pressing upon
her, she cast her griefs into the bosom of God. Her third son she names from
"joining;" 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F526</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as if she would say, now a new link is interposed, so that she should be more
loved by her husband. In her fourth son, she again declares her piety towards
God, for she gives to him the name of "praise," 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F527</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as having been granted to her by the special kindness of God. She had, indeed,
previously given thanks to the Lord; but whereas more abundant material for
praise is supplied, she acknowledges not once only, nor by one single method,
but frequently, that she has been assisted by the favor of God.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when Rachel
saw</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here Moses begins to relate that Jacob was
distracted with domestic strifes. But although the Lord was punishing him,
because he had been guilty of no light sin in marrying two wives, and especially
sisters; yet the chastisement was paternal; and God himself, seeing that he is
wont mercifully to pardon his own people, restrained in some degree his hand.
Whence also it happened, that Jacob did not immediately repent, but added new
offenses to the former. But first we must speak of Rachel. Whereas she rejoiced
to see her sister subjected to contempt and grief, the Lord represses this
sinful joy, by giving his blessing to Leah, in order to make the condition of
both of them equal. She hears the grateful acknowledgment of her sister, and
learns from the names given to the four sons, that God had pitied, and had
sustained by his favor, her who had been unjustly despised by man. Nevertheless
envy inflames her, and will not suffer anything of the dignity becoming a wife
to appear in her. We see what ambition can do. For Rachel, in seeking
preeminence, does not spare even her own sister; and scarcely refrains from
venting her anger against God, for having honored that sister with the gift of
fruitfulness. Her emulation did not proceed from any injuries that she had
received, but because she could not bear to have a partner and an equal, though
she herself was really the younger. What would she have done had she been
provoked, seeing that she envies her sister who was contented with her lot? Now
Moses, by exhibiting this evil in Rachel, would teach us that it is inherent in
all; in order that each of us, tearing it up by the roots, may vigilantly purify
himself from it. That we may be cured of envy, it behaves us to put away pride
and selflove; as Paul prescribes this single remedy against
contentions</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Let nothing be done
through vainglory."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;500803&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Philippians
2:3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob's anger was
kindled</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The tenderness of Jacob's affection
rendered him unwilling to offend his wife; yet her unworthy conduct compelled
him to do so, when he saw her petulantly exalt herself, not only against her
sister, who piously, homily, and thankfully was enjoying the gifts of God; but
even against God himself, of whom it is said that the fruit of the womb is his
reward.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19C703&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
127:3.) On this account, therefore, Jacob is angry, because his wife ascribes
nothing to the providence of God, and, by imagining that children are the
offspring of chance, would deprive God of the care and government of mankind. It
is probable that Jacob had been already sorrowful on account of his wife's
barrenness. He now, therefore, fears lest her folly should still farther provoke
God's anger to inflict more severe strokes. This was a holy indignation, by
which Jacob maintained the honor due to God, while he corrected his wife, and
taught her that it was not without sufficient cause that she had been hitherto
barren. For when he affirms that the Lord had shut her womb, he obliquely
intimates that she ought the more deeply to humble
herself.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold my maid
Bilhah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here the vanity of the female
disposition appears. For Rachel is not induced to flee unto the Lord, but
strives to gain a triumph by illicit arts. Therefore she hurries Jacob into a
third marriage. Whence we infer, that there is no end of sinning, when once the
Divine institution is treated with neglect. And this is what I have said, that
Jacob was not immediately brought back to a right state of mind by Divine
chastisements. He acts, indeed, in this instance, at the instigation of his
wife: but is his wife in the place of God, from whom alone the law of marriage
proceeds? But to please his wife, or to yield to her importunity, he does not
scruple to depart from the command of God.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To bear upon the
knees</i></font><font face="Palatino">, is nothing more than to commit the child
when born to another to be brought up. Bilhah was a maidservant; and therefore
did not bear for herself but for her mistress, who, claiming the child as her
own, thus procured the honor of a mother. Therefore it is added, in the way of
explanation, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I shall have
children, or I shall be built up by her</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
For the word which Moses here uses, is derived from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;b</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>ben</i>,) <i>a son</i>: because children are as the support and stay of a
house. But Rachel acted sinfully, because she attempted, by an unlawful method,
and in opposition to the will of God, to become a
mother.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Bilhah
conceived</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is wonderful that God should have
deigned to honor an adulterous connection with offspring: but he does sometimes
thus strive to overcome by kindness the wickedness of men, and pursues the
unworthy with his favor. Moreover, he does not always make the punishment equal
to the offenses of his people, nor does he always rouse them, alike quickly,
from their torpor, but waits for the matured season of correction. Therefore it
was his will that they who were born from this faulty connection, should yet be
reckoned among the legitimate children; just as Moses shortly before called
Bilhah a wife, who yet might more properly have been called a harlot. And the
common rule does not hold, that what had no force from the beginning can never
acquire validity by succession of time; for although the compact, into which the
husband and wife sinfully entered against the Divine command and the sacred
order of nature, was void; it came to pass nevertheless, by special privilege,
that the conjunction, which in itself was adulterous, obtained the honor of
wedlock. At length Rachel begins to ascribe to God what is his own; but this
confession of hers is so mixed up with ambition, that it breathes nothing of
sincerity or rectitude. She pompously announces, that her cause has been
undertaken by the Lord. As if truly, she had been so injured by her sister, that
she deserved to be raised by the favor of God; and as if she had not attempted
to deprive herself of his help. We see, then, that under the pretext of praising
God, she rather does him wrong, by rendering him subservient to her desires. Add
to this, that she imitates hypocrites, who, while in adversity, rush against God
with closed eyes; vet when more prosperous fortune favors them, indulge in vain
boastings, as if God smiled upon all their deeds and sayings. Rachel, therefore,
does not so much celebrate the goodness of God, as she applauds herself
Wherefore let the faithful, instructed by her example, abstain from polluting
the sacred name of God by hypocrisy.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>

wrestlings</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F528</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Others translate it, "I am joined with the joinings of God;" 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F529</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as if she exulted in having recovered what she had lost; or, certainly, in
having obtained an equal degree of honor with her sister. Others render it, I am
doubled with the duplications of God. But both derive the noun and the verb from
the root
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ltp</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>patal</i>,) which signifies a twisted thread. The former of these senses
comes to this; that since Rachel has attained a condition equal to that of her
sister, there is no reason why her sister should claim any superiority over her.
But the latter sense expresses more confident boasting, since she proclaims
herself a conqueror, and doubly superior. But a more simple meaning is (in my
opinion) adduced by others, namely, that she "wrestled with divine or excellent
wrestlings." For the Hebrews indicate all excellence by adding the name of God;
because the more excellent anything is, the more does the glory of God shine in
it. But perverse is that boasting with which she glories over her sister, when
she ought rather suppliantly to have implored forgiveness. In Rachel the pride
of the human mind is depicted; because they whom God has endowed with his
benefits, for the most part are so elated, that they rage contumeliously against
their neighbors. Besides, she foolishly prefers herself to her sister in
fruitfulness, in which she is still manifestly inferior. But they who are puffed
up with pride have also the habit of malignantly depreciating those gifts which
the Lord has bestowed on others, in comparison with their own smaller gifts.
Perhaps, also, she expected a numerous progeny, as if God were under obligation
to her. She did not, as pious persons are wont to do, conceive hope from
benefits received; but, by a confident presumption of the flesh, made herself
sure of everything she wished. Hitherto, then, she gave no sign of pious
modesty. Whence is this, but because her temporary barrenness had not yet
thoroughly subdued her? Therefore we ought the more to beware, lest if God
relaxes our punishments, we, being inflated by his kindness, should
perish.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When Leah saw that she had left
bearing.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Moses returns to Leah, who, not
content with four sons, devised a method whereby she might always retain her
superior rank: and therefore she also, in turn, substitutes her maid in her
place. And truly Rachel deserved such a reward of her perverse design; since
she, desiring to snatch the palm from her sister, does not consider that the
same contrivance to which she had resorted, might speedily be employed against
herself. Yet Leah sins still more grievously, by using wicked and unjust arts in
the contest. Within a short period, she had experienced the wonderful blessing
of God; and now, because she ceased from bearing, for a little while, she
despairs concerning the future, as if she had never participated in the Divine
favor. What, if her desire was strong; why did she not resort to the fountain of
blessing? In obtruding, therefore, her maid, she gave proof not only of
impatience, but also of distrust; because with the remembrance of Divine mercy,
faith also is extinguished in her heart. And we know that all who rely upon the
Lord are so tranquil and sedate in their mind, that they patiently wait for what
he is about to give. And it is the just punishment of unbelief when any one
stumbles through excessive haste. So much the more ought we to beware of the
assaults of the flesh, if we desire to maintain a right
course.</font><br><font face="Palatino">As to the name <i>Gad</i>, this passage
is variously expounded by commentators. In this point they agree, that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dgb</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>bagad</i>) means the same as if Leah had said "the time of bearing is come."
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F530</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But some suppose
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dg</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>Gad</i>,) to be the prosperous star of Jupiter; others, Mercury; others,
<i>good fortune</i>. They adduce
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;236511&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
65:11, where it is written, "they offer a libation to Gad." 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F531</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But the context of the Prophet shows that this ought rather to be understood of
the host of heaven, or of the number of false gods; because it immediately
follows that they offer sacrifices to the stars, and furnish tables for a
multitude of gods: the punishment is then added, that as they had fabricated an
immense number of deities, so God will "number" them "to the sword". As it
respects the present passage, nothing is less probable than that Leah should
extol the planet Jupiter instead of God, seeing that she, at least, maintained
the principle that the propagation of the human race flows from God alone. I
wonder also that interpreters understand this of prosperous fortune, when Moses
afterwards,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014919&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
49:19, leads us to an opposite meaning. For the allusion he there makes would be
inappropriate, "Gad, a troop shall overcome him," etc., unless it had been the
design of Leah to congratulate herself on the <i>troop</i> of her children. For
since she had so far surpassed her sister, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F532</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
she declares that she has children in great abundance. When she proclaims
herself <i>happy</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F533</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in her sixth son, it again appears in what great esteem fecundity was then held.
And certainly it is a great honor, when God confers on mortals the sacred title
of parents, and through them propagates the human race formed after his own
image.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.

that a boy brought home I know not what kind of fruit out of the fields, and
presented it to his mother, by which she purchased of her sister one nigh with
her husband, has the appearance of being light and puerile. Yet it contains a
useful instruction. For we know how foolishly the Jews glory in extolling the
origin of their own nation: for they scarcely deign to acknowledge that they
leave sprung from Adam and Noah, with the rest of mankind. And certainly they do

purposely aimed at beating down this arrogance, when he described their race as
sprung from a beginning, so mean and abject. For he does not here erect a

because her mind had been long so exasperated that she could not address herself
mildly and courteously to her sister: Perhaps the sisters were not thus
contentious by nature; but God suffered them to contend with each other, that
the punishment of polygamy might be exhibited to posterity. And it is not to be
doubted that this domestic private quarrel, yea, hostile dissension, brought
great grief and torment to the holy man. But the reason why he found himself
thus distracted by opposite parties was, that against all right, he had broken
the unity of the conjugal bond.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And God hearkened unto
Leah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses expressly declares this, in order
that we may know how indulgently God dealt with that family. For who would have
thought, that, while Leah was hatefully denying to her sister the fruits
gathered by her boy, and was purchasing, by the price of those fruits, a night
with her husband, there would be any place for prayers? Moses, therefore,
teaches us, that pardon was granted for these faults, to prove that the Lord
would not fail to complete his work notwithstanding such great infirmity. But
Leah ignorantly boasts that her son was given to her as a reward of her sin; for
she had violatedthe fidelity of holy wedlock, when she introduced a fresh
concubine to oppose her sister. Truly, she is so far from the confession of her
fault, that she proclaims her own merit. I grant there was some excuse for her
conduct; for she intimates that she was not so much excited by lust, as by
modest love, because she desired to increase her family and to fulfill the duty
of an honorable mother of a family. But though this pretext is specious in the
eyes of men, yet the profanation of holy marriage cannot be pleasing to God. She
errs, therefore, in taking what was <i>no cause</i> for <i>the cause</i>. And
this is the more to be observed; because it is a fault which too much prevails
in the world, for men to reckon the free gifts of God as their own reward; yea,
even to boast of their deserts, when they are condemned by the word of God. In
her sixth son, she more purely and rightly estimates the divine goodness, when
she gives thanks to God, that, by his kindness, her husband would hereafter be
more closely united to her, (verse 20). For although he had lived with her
before, yet, being too much attached to Rachel, he was almost entirely alienated
from Leah. It has before been said, that children born in lawful wedlock are
bonds to unite the minds of their
parents.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And afterward she bare a
daughter</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is not known whether Jacob had any
other daughter; for it is not uncommon in Scripture, when genealogies are
recorded, to omit the women, since they do not bear their own name, but lie
concealed under the shadow of their husbands. Meanwhile, if anything worthy of
commemoration occurs to any women, especial mention is then made of them. This
was the case with Dinah, on account of the violence done to her; of which more
will be said hereafter. But whereas the sons of Jacob subsequently regarded it
as an indignity that their sister should marry one of another nation; and as
Moses records nothing of any other daughters, either as being settled in the
land of Canaan, or married in Egypt, it is probable that Dinah was the only one
born to him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And God remembered
Rachel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Since with God nothing is either
<i>before</i> or <i>after</i>, but all things are present, he is subject to no
forgetfulness, so that, in the lapse of time, he should need to be reminded of
what is past. But the Scripture describes the presence and memory of God from
the effect produced upon ourselves, because we conceive him to be such as he
appears to be by his acts. Moreover, whether Rachel's child was born the last of
all, cannot with certainty be gathered from the words of Moses. They who, in
this place, affirm that the figure <i>hysteron</i> <i>proteron</i>, which puts
the last first, is used, are moved by the consideration, that if Joseph had been
born after the last of his brethren, the age which Moses records in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014146&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
41:46, would not accord with the fact. But they are deceived in this, that they
reckon the nuptials of Rachel from the end of the second seven years; whereas it
is certainly proved from the context, that although Jacob agreed to give his
service for Rachel, yet he obtained her immediately; because from the beginning,
the strife between the two sisters broke forth. Moses clearly intimates, in this
place, that the blessing of God was bestowed late, when Rachel had despaired of
issue, and had long been subject to reproach because of her barrenness. On
account of this prosperous omen she gave the name Joseph 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F536</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to her son, deriving the hope of two sons from the prospect of <i>one</i>.

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Send me away, that I may
go</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Seeing that Jacob had been retained by a
proposed reward for his services, it might appear that he was acting craftily in
desiring his dismissal from his father-in-law. I cannot, however, doubt that the
desire to return had already entered his mind, and that he ingenuously avowed
his intention. First; having experienced, in many ways, how unjust, how
perfidious, and even cruel, Laban had been, there is no wonder that he should
wish to depart from him, as soon as ever the opportunity was afforded. Secondly;
since, from the long space of time which had elapsed, he hoped that his
brother's mind would be appeased, he could not but earnestly wish to return to
his parents; especially as he had been oppressed by so many troubles, that he
could scarcely fear a worse condition in any other place. But the promise of God
was the most powerful stimulant of all to excite his desire to return. For he
had not rejected the benediction which was dearer to him than his own life. To
this point his declaration refers, "I will go to my own place and to my
country;" for he does not use this language concerning Canaan, only because he
was born there, but because he knew that it had been divinely granted to him.
For if he had said that he desired to return, merely because it was his native
soil, he might have been exposed to ridicule; since his father had passed a
wandering and unsettled life, continually changing his abode. I therefore
conclude, that although he might have dwelt commodiously elsewhere, the oracle
of God, by which the land of Canaan had been destined for him, was ever fresh in
his memory. And although, for a time, he submits to detention, this does not
alter his purpose to depart: for necessity, in part, extorted it from him, since
he was unable to extricate himself from the snares of his uncle; in part also,
he voluntarily gave way, in order that he might acquire something for himself
and his family, lest he should return poor and naked to his own country. But
here the insane wickedness of Laban is discovered. After he had almost worn out
his nephew and son-in-law, by hard and constant toil for fourteen years, he yet
offers him no wages for the future. The equity, of which at first he had made
such pretensions, had already vanished. For the greater had been the forbearance
of Jacob, the more tyrannical license did he usurp over him. So the world abuses
the gentleness of the pious; and the more meekly they conduct themselves, the
more ferociously does the world assail them. But though, like sheep, we are
exposed, in this world, to the violence and injuries of wolves; we must not fear
lest they should hurt or devour us, since the Heavenly Shepherd keeps us under
his protection.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I pray thee, if I have found
favor in thine eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We perceive hence, that
Jacob had not been a burdensome guest, seeing that Laban soothes him with bland
address, in order to procure from him a longer continuance in his service. For,
sordid and grasping as he was, he would not have suffered Jacob to remain a
moment in his house, unless he had found his presence to be a certain source of
gain. Inasmuch therefore, as he not only did not thrust him out, but anxiously
sought to retain him, we hence infer that the holy man had undergone incredible
labors, which had not only sufficed for the sustenance of a large family, but
had also brought great profit to his father-in-law. Wherefore, he complains
afterwards, not unjustly, that he had endured the heat of the day, and the cold
of the night. Nevertheless, there is no doubt, that the blessing of God availed
more than any labors whatever, so that Laban perceived Jacob to be a kind of
horn of plenty, as he himself confesses. For he not only commends his fidelity
and diligence, but expressly declares that he himself had I been blessed by the
Lord, for Jacob's sake. It appears, then, that the wealth of Laban had so
increased, from the time of Jacob's coming, that it was as if his gains had
visibly distilled from heaven. Moreover, as the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;jn</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>nachash</i>,) among the Hebrews, means to know by auguries or by divination,
some interpreters imagine that Laban, having been instructed in magic arts,
found that the presence of Jacob was useful and profitable to him. Others,
however, expound the words more simply, as meaning that he had proved it to be
so by experiment. To me the true interpretation seems to be, as if he had said,
that the blessing of God was as perceptible to him, as if it had been attested
by prophecy, or found out by augury.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou knowest how I have
served thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This answer of Jacob is not
intended to increase the amount of his wages; but he would expostulate with
Laban, and would charge him with acting unjustly and unkindly in requiring a
prolongation of the time of service. There is also no doubt that he is carried
forth, with every desire of his mind, towards the land of Canaan. Therefore a
return thither was, in his view, preferable to any kind of riches whatever. Yet,
in the mealtime, he indirectly accuses his father-in-law, both of cunning and of
inhumanity, in order that he may extort something from him, if be must remain
longer. For he could not hope that the perfidious old fox would, of himself,
perform an act of justice; neither does Jacob simply commend his own industry,
but shows that he had to deal with an unjust and cruel man. Meanwhile, it is to
be observed, that although he had labored strenuously, he yet ascribes nothing
to his own labor, but imputes it entirely to the blessing of God that Laban had
been enriched. For though when men faithfully devote themselves to their duty,
they do not lose their labor; yet their success depends entirely upon the favor
of God. What Paul asserts concerning the efficacy of teaching, extends still
further, that he who plants and he who waters is nothing,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460307&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 3:7,) for the similitude is taken from general experience. The use
of this doctrine is twofold. First, whatever I attempt, or to whatever work I
apply my hands, it is my duty to desire God to bless my labor, that it may not
be vain and fruitless. Then, if I have obtained anything, my second duty is to
ascribe the praise to God; without whose blessing, men in vain rise up early,
fatigue themselves the whole day, late take rest, eat the bread of carefulness,
and taste even a little water with sorrow. With respect to the meaning of the
<i>words</i>, when Jacob says, "It was little that thou hadst <i>in my
sight</i>," 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F538</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Jerome has well and skilfully translated them "before I came." For Moses puts
the <i>face</i> of Jacob for his actual <i>coming</i> and dwelling with
Laban.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And now, when shall I provide
for mine own house also?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He reasons, that when
he had so long expended his labors for another, it would be unjust that his own
family should be neglected. For nature prescribes this order, that every one
should take care of the family committed to him. To which point the saying of
Solomon is applicable, Drink water from thy own fountains, and let rivers flow
to thy neighbors. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F539</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Had Jacob been alone, he might have devoted himself more freely to the interests
of another; but now, since he is the husband of four wives, and the father of a
numerous offspring, he ought not to be forgetful of those whom he has received
at the hand of God to bring up.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt not give me
anything</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The antithesis between this and the
preceding clause is to be noticed. For Jacob does not demand for himself certain
and definite wages; but he treats with Laban, on this condition, that he shall
receive whatever offspring may be brought forth by the sheep and goats of a pure
and uniform color, which shall prove to be party-coloured and spotted. There is
indeed some obscurity in the words. For, at first, Jacob seems to require for
himself the spotted sheep as a present reward. But from the thirty-third verse
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;013033&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
30:33) another sense may be gathered: namely, that Jacob would suffer whatever
was variegated in the flock to be separated and delivered to the sons of Laban
to be fed; but that he himself would retain the unspotted sheep and goats. And
certainly it would be absurd that Jacob should now claim part of the flock for
himself, when he had just confessed, that hitherto he had made no gain.
Moreover, the gain thus acquired would have been more than was just; and there
was no hope that this could be obtained from Laban. A question however arises,
by what hope, or by what counsel bad Jacob been induced to propose this
condition? A little afterwards, Moses will relate that he had used cunning, in
order that party-coloured and spotted lambs might be brought forth by the pure
flock; but in the following chapter he more fully declares that Jacob had been
divinely instructed thus to act
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;013101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
31:1.) Therefore, although it was improbable in itself that this agreement
should prove useful to the holy man, he yet obeys the celestial oracle, and
wishes to be enriched in no other manner than according to the will of God. But
Laban was dealt with according to his own disposition; for he eagerly caught at
what seemed advantageous to himself, but God disappointed his shameful
cupidity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>33.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So shall my righteousness
answer for me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Literally it is, "My
righteousness shall answer in me." But the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">yb</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>bi</i>) signifies <i>to me</i> or <i>for me</i>. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F540</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The sense, however, is clear, that Jacob does not expect success, except through
his faith and integrity. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F541</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Respecting the next clause, interpreters differ. For some read, "When thou shalt
come to my reward." 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F542</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But others, translating in the third person, explain it of righteousness, which
shall come to the reward, or to the remunerating of Jacob. Although either sense
will suit the passage, I rather refer it to righteousness; because it is
immediately added, "before thee." 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F543</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For it would be an improper form of expression, "Thou wilt come before thine own
eyes to my reward." It now sufficiently appears what Jacob meant. For he
declares that he hoped for a testimony of his faith and uprightness from the
Lord, in the happy result of his labors, as if he had said, "The Lord who is the
best judge and vindicator of my righteousness, will indeed show with what
sincerity and faithfulness I have hitherto conducted myself." And though the
Lord often permits sinners to be enriched by wicked arts, and suffers them to
acquire abundant gain by seizing the goods of others as their own: this proves
no exception to the rule, that his blessing is the ordinary attendant on good
faith and equity. Wherefore, Jacob justly gave this token of his fidelity, that
he committed the success of his labors to the Lord, in order that his integrity
might hence be made manifest. The sense of the words is now clear, "My
righteousness shall openly testify for me, because it will voluntarily come to
remunerate me; and that so obviously, that it shall not he hidden even from
thee." A tacit reproof is couched in this language, intimating that Laban should
feel how unjustly he had withheld the wages of the holy man, and that God would
shortly show, by the result, how wickedly he had dissembled respecting his own
obligation to him. For there is an antithesis to be understood between the
future and the past time, when he says, "<i>Tomorrow</i> (or in time to come) it
will answer for me," since indeed, <i>yesterday</i> and the <i>day before</i>,
he could extort no justice from
Laban.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every one that is not
speckled and spotted</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Jacob binds himself to
the crime and punishment of theft, if he should take away any unspotted sheep
from the flock: as if he would say, "Shouldst thou find with me anything
unspotted, I am willing to be charged as a thief; because I require nothing to
be given to me but the spotted lambs." Some expound the words otherwise,
"Whatsoever thou shalt find deficient in thy flock, require of me, as if I had
stolen it;" but this appears to me a forced
interpretation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>35.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he removed that
day</i></font><font face="Palatino">. From this verse the form of the compact is
more certainly known. Laban separates the sheep and goats marked with spots from
the pure flock, that is, from the white or black, and commits these to his sons
to be fed; interposing a three-days' journey between them and the rest; lest, by
promiscuous intercourse, a particoloured offspring should be produced. It
follows, therefore, that, in the flock which Jacob fed, nothing remained but
cattle of one color: thus but faint hope of gain remained to the holy man, while
every provision was made for Laban's advantage. It also appears, from the
distance of the places, in which Laban kept his flocks apart, that he was not
less suspicious than covetous; for dishonest men are wont to measure others by
their own standard; whence it happens that they are always distrustful and
alarmed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>37.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob took him rods of
green poplar</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The narration of Moses, at first
sight, may seem absurd: for he either intends to censure holy Jacob as guilty of
fraud, or to praise his industry. But from the context it will appear that this
adroitness was not culpable. Let us then see how it is to be excused. Should any
one contend that he was impelled to act as he did, by the numerous injuries of
his father-in-law, and that he sought nothing but the reparation of former
losses; the defense would perhaps be plausible: yet in the sight of God it is
neither firm nor probable; for although we may be unjustly treated, we must not
enter the contest with equal injustice. And were it permitted to avenge our own
injuries, or to repair our own wrongs, there would be no place for legal
judgments, and thence would arise horrible confusion. Therefore Jacob ought not
to have resorted to this stratagem, for the purpose of producing degenerate
cattle, but rather to have followed the rule which the Lord delivers by the
mouth of Paul, that the faithful should study to overcome evil with good,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451221&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
12:21.) This simplicity, I confess, ought to have been cultivated by Jacob,
unless the Lord from heaven had commanded otherwise. But in this narrative there
is a <i>hysteron proteron</i>, (a putting of the last first,) for Moses first
relates the fact, and then subjoins that Jacob had attempted nothing but by the
command of God. Wherefore, it is not for those persons to claim him as their
advocate, who oppose malignant and fraudulent men with fallacies like their own;
because Jacob did not, of his own will, take license craftily to circumvent his
father-in-law, by whom he had been unworthily deceived; but, pursuing the course
prescribed to him by the Lord, kept himself within due bounds. In vain, also,
according to my judgment, do some dispute whence Jacob learnt this; whether by
long practice or by the teaching of his fathers; for it is possible, that he had
been suddenly instructed respecting a matter previously unknown. If any one
object, the absurdity of supposing, that this act of deceit was suggested by
God; the answer is easy, that God is the author of no fraud, when he stretches
out his hand to protect his servant. Nothing is more appropriate to him, and
more in accordance with his justice, than that he should interpose as an
avenger, when any injury is inflicted. But it is not our part to prescribe to
him his method of acting. He suffered Laban to retain what he unjustly
possessed; but in six years he withdrew his blessing from Laban, and transferred
it to his servant Jacob. If an earthly judge condemns a thief to restore twofold
or fourfold, no one complains: and why should we concede less to God, than to a
mortal and perishing man? He had other methods in his power; but he purposed to
connect his grace with the labor and diligence of Jacob, that he might openly
repay to him those wages of which he had been long defrauded. For Laban was
constrained to open his eyes, which being before shut, he had been accustomed to
consume the sweat and even the blood of another. Moreover, as it respects
physical causes, it is well known, that the sight of objects by the female has
great effect on the form of the foetus. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F544</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
When this happens with women, takes it at least place with animals, where is no
reason, but where reigns an enormous rush of carnal lusts. Now Jacob did three
things. For first, he stripped the bark from twigs that he might make bare some
white places by the incisions in the bark, and thus a varying and manifold color
was produced. Secondly, he chose the times when the males and females were
assembled. Thirdly, he put the twigs in the waters, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F545</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for like the drinking feeds the animal parts, it also urges on the sexual drive.
By the <i>stronger</i> cattle Moses may be understood to speak of those who bore
in spring &#8212; by the feeble, those who bore in
autumn.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>43.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the man increased
exceedingly</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses added this for the purpose
of showing that he was not made thus suddenly rich without a miracle. We shall
see hereafter how great his wealth was. For being entirely destitute, he yet
gathered out of nothing, greater riches than any man of moderate wealth could do
in twenty or thirty years. And that no one may deem this fabulous, as not being
in accordance with the usual method, Moses meets the objection by saying, that
the holy man was enriched in an extraordinary manner.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he heard the
words</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Although Jacob ardently desired his own
country, and was continually thinking of his return to it; yet his admirable
patience appears in this, that he suspends his purpose till a new occasion
presents itself. I do not, however, deny, that some imperfection was mixed with
this virtue, in that he did not make more haste to return; but that the promise
of God was always retained its his mind will shortly appear. In this respect,
however, he showed something of human nature, that for the sake of obtaining
wealth he postponed his return for six years: for when Laban was perpetually
changing his terms, he might justly have bidden him farewell. But that he was
detained by force and fear together, we infer from his clandestine flight. Now,
at least, he has a sufficient cause for asking his dismissal; because his riches
had become grievous and hateful to the sons of Laban: nevertheless he does not
dare openly to withdraw himself from their enmity, but is compelled to flee
secretly. Yet though his tardiness is in some degree excusable, it was probably
connected with indolence; even as the faithful, when they direct their course
towards God, often do not pursue it with becoming fervor. Wherefore, whenever
the indolence of the flesh retards us, let us learn to fan the ardor of our
spirits into a flame. There is no doubt that the Lord corrected the infirmity of
his servant, and gently spurred him on as he proceeded in his course. For if
Laban had treated him kindly and pleasantly, his mind would have been lulled to
sleep; but now he is driven away by adverse looks. So the Lord often better
secures the salvation of his people, by subjecting them to the hatred, the envy,
and the malevolence of the wicked, than by suffering them to be soothed with
bland address. It was far more useful to holy Jacob to have his father-in-law
and his sons opposed, than to have them courteously obsequious to his wishes;
because their favor might have deprived him of the blessing of God. We also have
more than sufficient experience of the power of earthly attractions, and of the
ease with which, when they abound, the oblivion of celestial blessings steals
over us. Wherefore let us not think it hard to be awakened by the Lord, when we
fall into adversity, or receive but little favor from the world; for hatred,
threats, disgrace, and slanders, are often more advantageous to us than the
applause of all men on every side. Moreover, we must notice the inhumanity of
Laban's sons, who complain throughout as if they had been plundered by Jacob.
But sordid and avaricious men labor under the disease of thinking that they are
robbed of everything with which they do not gorge themselves. For since their
avarice is insatiable, it follows of necessity that the prosperity of others
torments them, as if they themselves would be thereby reduced to want. They do
not consider whether Jacob acquired this great wealth justly or unjustly; but
they are enraged and envious, because they conceive that so much has been
abstracted from them. Laban had before confessed, that he had been enriched by
the coming of Jacob, and even that he had been blessed by the Lord for Jacob's
sake; but now his sons murmur, and he himself is tortured with grief, to find
that Jacob also is made a partaker of the same blessing. Hence we perceive the
blindness of avarice which can never be satisfied. Whence also it is called by
Paul the root of all evil; because they who desire to swallow up everything must
be perfidious, and cruel, and ungrateful, and in every way unjust. Besides, it
is to be observed that the sons of Laban, in the impetuosity of their younger
years, give vent to their vexation; but the father, like a cunning old fox, is
silent, yet betrays his wickedness by his
countenance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said unto
Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The timidity of the holy man is here
more plainly seen; for he, perceiving that evil was designed against him by his
father-in-law, still dared not to move a foot, unless encouraged by a new
oracle. But the Lord, who, by facts, had shown him already that no longer delay
was to be made, now also urges him by words. Let us learn from this example,
that although the Lord may incite us to duty by adversity, yet we shall thereby
profit little, unless the stimulus of the word be added. And we see what will
happen to the reprobate; for either they become stupefied in their wickedness,
or they break out into fury. Wherefore, that the instruction conveyed by outward
things may profit us, we must ask the Lord to shine upon us in his own word. The
design, however, of Moses chiefly refers to this point, that we may know that
Jacob returned to his own country, under the special guidance of God. Now the
land of Canaan is called the land of Abraham and Isaac, not because they had
sprung from it; but because it had been divinely promised to them as their
inheritance. Wherefore, by this voice the holy man was admonished, that although
Isaac had been a stranger, yet, in the sight of God, he was the heir and lord of
that land, in which he possessed nothing but a
sepulcher.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob
sent</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He sends for his wives, in order to
explain to them his intention, and to exhort them to accompany him in his
flight; for it was his duty as a good husband to take them away with him; and
therefore it was necessary to inform them of his design. And he was not so blind
as to be unmindful of the many dangers of his plan. It was difficult to convey
women, who had never left their father's house, to a remote region, by an
unknown journey. Moreover, there was ground to fear lest they, in seeking
protection for themselves, might betray their husband to his enemies. The
coverage of many would so far have failed them, in such a state of perturbation,
that they would have disregarded conjugal fidelity, to provide for their own
safety. Jacob, therefore, acted with great constancy in choosing rather to
expose himself to danger than to fail in the duty of a good husband and master
of a family. If his wives had refused to accompany him, the call of God would
have compelled him to depart. But God granted him what was far more desirable,
that his whole family, with one consent, were prepared to follow him: moreover,
his wives, with whose mutual strifes his house before had rung, now freely
consent to go with him into exile. So the Lord, when in good faith we discharge
our duty, and shun nothing which he commands, enables us to succeed, even in the
most doubtful affairs. Further, from the fact that Jacob calls his wives to him
into the field, we infer what an anxious life he led. Certainly it would have
been a primary convenience of his life, to dwell at home with his wives. He was
already advanced in age, and worn down with many toils; and therefore he had the
greater need of their service. Yet satisfied with a cottage in which he might
watch over his flock, he lived apart from them. If, then, there had been a
particle of equity in Laban and his sons, they would have found no cause for
envy.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I see your father's
countenance</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This address consists of two
parts. For first, he speaks of his own integrity, and expostulates concerning
the perfidy of his father-in-law. He next testifies that God is the author of
his prosperity, in order that Rachel and Leah may the more willingly accompany
him. And whereas he had become very rich in a short space of time, he purges
himself from all suspicion; and even appeals to them as witnesses of his
diligence. And though Moses does not minutely relate everything; yet there is no
doubt that the honesty of their husband had been made clear to them by many
proofs, and that, on the other hand, the injuries, frauds, and rapacity of their
father, were well known. When he complains that his wages had been changed ten
times, it is probable that the number ten is simply put for <i>many</i> times.
Nevertheless it may be, that within six years Laban might thus frequently have
broken his agreements; since there would be twice as many seasons of breeding
lambs, namely, at spring and autumn, as we have said. But this narration of the
dream, although it follows in a subsequent part of the history, shows that holy
Jacob had undertaken nothing but by the Divine command. Moses had before related
the transaction simply, saying nothing respecting the counsel from which it had
proceeded; but now, in the person of Jacob himself, he removes all doubt
respecting it; for he does not intimate that Jacob was lying, in order, by this
artifice, to deceive his wives; but he introduces the holy servant of God,
avowing truly, and without pretense, the case as it really was. For otherwise he
would have abused the name of God, not without abominable impiety, by connecting
this vision with that former one, in which we see that the gate of heaven was
opened unto him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am the God of
Beth-el</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is not wonderful that the angel
should assume the person of God: either because God the Father appeared to the
holy patriarchs in his own Word, as in a lively mirror, and that under the form
of an angel; or because angels, speaking by the command of God, rightly utter
their words, as from his mouth. For the prophets are accustomed to this form of
speaking; not that they may exalt themselves into the place of God; but only
that the majesty of God, whose ministers they are, may shine forth in his
message. Now, it is proper that we should more carefully consider the force of
this form of expression. He does not call himself the God of Bethel, because he
is confined within the limits of a given place, but for the purpose of renewing
to his servant the remembrance of his own promise; for holy Jacob had not yet
attained to that degree of perfection which rendered the more simple rudiments
unnecessary for him. But little light of true doctrine at that time prevailed;
and even that was wrapped in many shadows. Nearly the whole world had
apostatized to false gods; and that region, nay, even the house of his
father-in-law, was filled with unholy superstitions. Therefore, amid so many
hindrances, nothing was more difficult for him than to hold his faith in the one
true God firm and invincible. Wherefore, in the first place, pure religion is
commended to him, in order that, among the various errors of the world, he may
adhere to the obedience and worship of that God whom he had once known.
Secondly; the promise which he had before received is anew confirmed to him, in
order that he may always keep his mind fixed on the special covenant which God
had made with Abraham and his posterity. Thus he is directed to the land of
Canaan, which was his own inheritance; lest the temporal blessing of God, which
he was soon to enjoy, should detain his heart in Mesopotamia. For since this
oracle was only an appendix of the previous one, whatever benefits God
afterwards bestowed ought to be referred to that first design. We may also
conjecture from this passage, that Jacob had before preached to his household
concerning the true God and the true religion, as became a pious father of his
family. For he would have acted absurdly in uttering this discourse, unless his
wives had been previously instructed respecting that wonderful vision. To the
same point belongs what he had said before, that the God of his father had
brought him assistance. For it is just as if he would openly distinguish the God
whom he worshipped from the god of Laban. And now, because he holds familiar
discourse with his wives, as on subjects which they know, the conjecture is
probable, that it was not Jacob's fault if they were not imbued with the
knowledge of the one God, and with sincere piety. Further, by this oracle the
Lord declared that he is always mindful of the godly, even when they seem to be
cast down and deserted. For who would not have said that the outcast Jacob was
now deprived of all celestial help? And truly the Lord appears to him late; but
beyond all expectation shows, that he had never been forgetful of him. Let the
faithful, also, at this day, feel that he is the same towards them; and if, in
any way, the wicked tyrannically oppress them by unjust violence, let them bear
it patiently, until at length, in due time, he shall avenge
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.

God.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450828&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:28.) For since the wives of Jacob had been unjustly treated by their father,
they so far act in opposition to the natural tenderness of their sex, that at
the desire of their husband, they become willing to follow him into a distant
and unknown region. Therefore, if Jacob is compelled to take many and very
bitter draughts of grief, he is now cheered by the most satisfying compensation,
that his wives are not separated from him by their attachment to their father's
house: but rather, being overcome by the irksome nature of their sufferings,
they earnestly undertake to join him in his flight. "There is nothing," they
say, "which should cause us to remain with our father; for daughters adhere to
their fathers, because they are esteemed members of his family; but what a cruel
rejection is this, not only that he has passed us off without dowry, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F546</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but that he has set us to sale, and has devoured the price for which he sold
us?" By the word <i>money</i>
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;013115&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
31:15), I understand the price of sale. For they complain that, at least, they
had not received, instead of dowry, the profit which had been unjustly extorted
from their husband, but this gain also had been unjustly suppressed by their
covetous father. Therefore the particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;g
</font><font face="Palatino">(<i>gam</i>) is inserted, which is used for the
purpose of amplification among the Hebrews. For this increased not a little the
meanness of Laban, that, as an insatiable whirlpool, he had absorbed the gain
acquired by this most dishonorable traffic. And it is to be noted, that they
were then devoted to their husband, and were therefore free to depart from their
father; especially since they knew that the hand of God was stretched out to
them. There is also no doubt, seeing they were persuaded that Jacob was a
faithful prophet of God, but that they freely embraced the heavenly oracle from
his mouth; for at the close of their reply, they show that they did not so much
yield to his wish as to the command of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For all the riches which God
has taken from our father</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Rachel and Leah
confirm the speech of Jacob; but yet in a profane and common manner, not with a
lively and pure sense of religion. For they only make a passing allusion to the
fact, that God, in pity to his servant, had deigned to honor him with peculiar
favor; and in the meantime, insist upon a reason of little solidity, that what
they were carrying away was justly their due, because a part of the inheritance
pertained to them. They do not argue that the riches they possessed were theirs,
because they had been justly acquired. by the labor of their husband; but
because they themselves ought not to have been defrauded of their dowry, and now
deprived of their lawful inheritance. For this reason they mention also their
children with themselves, as having sprung from the blood of Laban. By this
method they not only obscure the blessing of God, but indulge themselves in
greater license than is right. They also form a mean estimate of their husband's
labors, in boasting that the fruit of those labors proceeded from themselves.
Wherefore we are, by no means, to seek hence a precedent for the way in which
each is to defend his own right, or to attempt the recovery of it, when it has
been unjustly wrested from him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then Jacob rose
up</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The departure of Jacob Moses afterwards
more fully relates, he now only briefly says that "he rose up;" by which he
means, that as soon as he could obtain the consent of his wives to go with him,
he yielded to no other obstacles. Herein appears the manly strength and
constancy of his mind. For Moses leaves many things to be reflected upon by his
readers; and especially that intermediate period, during which the holy man was
doubtless agitated with a multiplicity of cares. He had believed that his exile
from home would be only for a short time: but, deprived of the sight of his
parents and of his native soil during twenty years, he suffered many things so
severe and bitter, that the endurance of them might have rendered him callous,
or, at least, might have so oppressed him as to have consumed the remnant of his
life. He was now verging towards old age, and the coldness of old age produces
tardiness. Yet the flight for which he was preparing was not free from danger.
Therefore it was necessary that he should be armed with the spirit of fortitude,
in order that the vigor and alacrity of which Moses speaks, might cause him to
hasten his steps. And since we read that the departure of the holy man was
effected by stealth, and was attended with discredit; let us learn, whenever God
abases us, to turn our minds to such examples as
this.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Rachel had
stolen</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Although the Hebrews sometimes call
those images
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yprt</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>teraphim</i>,) which are not set forth as objects of worship: yet since this
term is commonly used in an ill sense, I do not doubt that they were the
household gods of Laban. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F547</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Even he himself, shortly afterwards, expressly calls them his gods. It appears
hence how great is the propensity of the human mind to idolatry: since in all
ages this evil has prevailed; namely, that men seek out for themselves visible
representations of God. From the death of Noah not yet two hundred years had
elapsed; Shem had departed but a little while before; his teaching, handed down
by tradition, ought most of all to have flourished among the posterity of Terah;
because the Lord had chosen this family to himself, as the only sanctuary on
earth in which he was to be worshipped in purity. The voice of Shem himself was
sounding in their ears until the death of Abraham.; yet now, from Terah himself,
the common filth of superstition inundated this place, while the patriarch Shem
was still living and speaking. And though there is no doubt that he endeavored,
with all his power, to bring back his descendants to a right mind, we see what
was his success. It is not indeed to be believed, that Bethuel had been entirely
ignorant of the call of Abraham; yet neither he, with his family, was, on that
account, withdrawn from this vanity. Holy Jacob also had not been silent during
twenty years, but had endeavored, by counsel and admonition, to correct these
gross vices, but in vain; because superstition, in its violent course,
prevailed. Therefore, that idolatry is almost innate in the human mind, the very
antiquity of its origin bears witness. And that it is so firmly fixed there as
scarcely to be capable of being uprooted, shows its obstinacy. But it is still
more absurd, that not even Rachel could be healed of this contagion, in so great
a length of time. She had often heard her husband speaking of the true and
genuine worship of God: yet she is so addicted to the corruptions which she had
imbibed from her childhood, that she is ready to infect the land chosen by God
with them. She imagines that, with her husband, she is following God as her
leader, and at the same time takes with her the idols by which she would subvert
his worship. It is even possible that by the excessive indulgence of his beloved
wife, Jacob might give too much encouragement to such superstitions. Wherefore,
let pious fathers of families learn to use their utmost diligence that no stain
of evil may remain in their wives or children. Some inconsiderately excuse
Rachel, on the ground that, by a pious theft, she wished to purge her father's
house from idols. But if this had been her design, why, in crossing the
Euphrates, did she not cast away these abominations? Why did she not, after her
departure, explain to her husband what she had done? But there is no need of
conjecture, since, from the sequel of the history, it is manifest that the house
of Jacob was polluted with idols, even to the time of the violation of Dinah. It
was not, then, the piety of Rachel, but her insane hankering after superstition
which impelled her to the theft: because she thought that God could not be
worshipped but through idols; for this is the source of the disease, that since
men are carnal, they imagine God to be carnal
too.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob stole away unawares
to Laban</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F548</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
By the Hebrew form of expression, "stole away the heart of Laban," Moses shows
that Jacob departed privately, or by stealth, unknown to his father-in-law.
Meanwhile, he wishes to point out to what straits Jacob was reduced, so that he
had no hope of deliverance but in flight. For Laban had determined to hold him
all his life as a captive, as if he had been a slave bound to the soil, or
sentenced to the mines. Therefore let us also learn, by his example, when the
Lord calls us, courageously to strive against every kind of obstacle, and not to
be surprised if many arduous difficulties oppose themselves against
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it was told
Laban</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Lord gave to his servant the
interval of a three-days' journey, so that having passed the Euphrates, he might
enter the boundaries of the promised land. And perhaps, in the mean time, he
cooled the rage of Laban, the assault of which, in its first heat, might have
been intolerable severe. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F549</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
By afterward permitting Jacob to be intercepted in the midst of his journey, God
intended to tender his own interposition the more illustrious. It seemed
desirable that Jacob's course should not be interrupted, and that he should not
be filled with alarm by the hostile approach of his father-in-law; but when
Laban, like a savage wild beast, breathing nothing but slaughter, is suddenly
restrained by the Lord, this was far more likely to confirm the faith of the
holy man, and therefore far more useful to him. For, as in the very act of
giving assistance, the power of God shone forth more clearly; so, relying on
divine help, he passed more courageously through remaining trials. Whence we
learn, that those perturbations which, at the time, are troublesome to us, yet
tend to our salvation, if only we obediently submit to the will of God; who
purposely thus tries us, that he may indeed show more fully the care which he
takes of us. It was a sad and miserable sight, that Jacob, taking so large a
family with him, should flee as if his conscience had accused him of evil: but
it was far more bitter and more formidable, that Laban, intent on his
destruction, should threaten his life. Yet the method of his deliverance, which
is described by Moses, was more illustrious than any victory. For God,
descending from heaven to bring assistance to his servant, places himself
between the parties, and in a moment assuages the indomitable fury with which
Laban was inflamed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And pursued him seven days'
journey</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Since the cruelty of Laban was now
appeased, or at least bridled, he did not dare severely to threaten; but laying
aside his ferocity, he descended to feigned and hypocritical blandishments. He
complains that injury had been done him, because he had been kept in ignorance
of Jacob's departure, whom he would rather leave sent forth with customary
tokens of joy, in token of his paternal affection. Thus hypocrites, when the
power of inflicting injury is taken away from them, heap false complaints upon
the good and simple, as if the blame rested with them. Wherefore, if at any time
wicked and perfidious men, when they have unjustly harassed us, put forward some
pretext of equity on their own part, we must bear with the iniquity; not because
a just defense is to be entirely omitted; but because we find it inevitable that
perverse men, ever ready to speak evil, will shamelessly cast upon us the blame
of crimes of which we are innocent. Meanwhile, we must prudently guard against
giving them the occasion against us which they
seek.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It is in the power of my
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Hebrew phrase is different, "my hand
is to power;" yet the meaning is clear, that Laban declares he is ready to take
vengeance. Some expound the words thus: "my hand is to God;" but from other
places it appears that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">la</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>el</i>) is taken for <i>power</i>. But Laban, inflated with foolish
boasting, contradicts himself; for whereas he had been forbidden by God to
attempt anything against Jacob, where was the <i>power</i> of which he boasted?
We see, therefore, he precipitates himself by a blind impulse, as if, at his own
pleasure, he could do anything against the purpose of God. For when he perceives
that God is opposed to him, he yet does not hesitate to glory in his own
strength; and why is this, unless he aimed at being superior to God? Finally;
pride is always the companion of unbelief; so that unbelievers, although
vanquished, yet cease not impetuously to rise up against God. To this they add
another sin, that they complain of being unjustly oppressed by
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the God of your
father</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Why does he not also acknowledge God as
his own God, unless because Satan had so fascinated his mind already, that he
chose rather to wander in darkness than to turn to the light presented before
him? Willingly or unwillingly, he is compelled to yield to the God of Abraham;
and yet he defrauds him of the glory which is due, by retaining those fictitious
deities by which he had been deceived. We see then that the ungodly, even when
they have had proof of the power of God, yet do not entirely submit themselves
to his authority. Wherefore, when God manifests himself to us, we must also seek
from heaven the spirit of meekness, which shall bend and subdue us to obedience
unto himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F550</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The second head of accusation which is alleged against Jacob is, that he had not
departed through love to his country, nor for any just and probable cause; but
that, in fact, he was implicated in an act of robbery. Heavy and disgraceful
charge, of which Jacob was far from being guilty! But we learn hence, that no
one can live so innocently in the world, but he must sometimes bear undeserved
reproach and marks of infamy. Whenever this may happen to us, let that precious
promise sustain us, that the Lord, in his own time, will bring forth our
innocence as the morning light.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193706&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
37:6.) For by this artifice Satan attempts to seduce us from the practice of
well-doing, when, without any fault of ours, we are traduced by false calumnies.
And since the world is ungrateful, it often makes the very worst return for acts
of kindness. Some, indeed, are found, who, with heroic magnanimity, despise
unfavourable reports, because they esteem the testimony of a good conscience
more highly than depraved popular opinion. But it behoves the faithful to look
to God, that their conscience may never fail them. We see that Laban calls his
gods </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yprt
</font><font face="Palatino">(<i>teraphim</i>,) not because he thought the Deity
was enclosed within them; but because he worshipped these images in honor of the
gods. Or rather, because, when he was about to pay homage to God, he turned
himself to those images. At this day, by the sole difference of a word, the
Papists think they skilfully effect their escape, because they do not attribute
to idols the name of gods. But the subterfuge is frivolous, since in reality
they are altogether alike; for they pour forth before pictures or statues
whatever honor they acknowledge to be due to the one God. To the ancient
idolaters the pretext was not wanting, that by a metonymy they styled those
images gods, which were formed for the sake of representing
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob
answered</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He briefly refutes each head of the
accusation: with respect to his secret departure, he modestly excuses himself,
as having been afraid that he might be deprived of his wives. And in this way he
takes part of the blame to himself, deeming it sufficient to exonerate himself
from the malice of which he was thought to be guilty. He does not dispute, as a
casuist, whether it was lawful to depart by stealth; but leaves it undetermined
whether or not his fear was culpable. Let all the children of God learn to
imitate this modesty, lest through an immoderate desire to vindicate their own
reputation, they should rush into contentions: just as we have seen many raise
tragic scenes out of nothing, because they will not endure that any censure,
however trifling, should be cast upon them. Jacob, therefore, was content with
this excuse, that he had done nothing wickedly. His defense on the other charge
follows, in which Jacob shows his confidence, by adjudicating the person to
death, with whom the things stolen should be found. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F551</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He speaks, indeed, from his heart; but if the truth had then been discovered, he
must, of necessity, have been ashamed of his rashness. Therefore, though he was
not conscious of guilt, he yet singled through excessive haste, in not having
diligently inquired before he pronounced concerning a doubtful matter. He ought
to have called both his wives and his children, and to have inquired of each how
the affair stood. He was, indeed, persuaded, that his family was so well
conducted, that no suspicion of the theft had ever entered into his mind; but he
ought not so to have relied upon his own discipline, as to be free from fear
when a crime is alleged against his family. Wherefore, let us learn to suspend
our judgment in matters of which we are ignorant, lest we should repent too late
of our temerity. We may add, that hence it happened, that the pollution which he
might have exterminated immediately, continued still longer in the family of
Jacob.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>32.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That Rachel had stolen
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses relates the manner in which Rachel
had concealed her theft; namely, by sitting on the idols, and pretending the
custom of women as her excuse. It is a question, whether she did this through
shame or pertinacity. It was disgraceful to be caught in the act of theft; she
also dreaded the severe sentence of her husband. Yet to me it appears probable
that fear did not so much influence her as the obstinate love of idolatry. For
we know how greatly superstition infatuates the mind. Therefore, as if she had
obtained an incomparable treasure, she thinks that she must attempt anything
rather than allow herself to be deprived of it. Moreover, she chooses rather to
incur the displeasure of her father and her husband, than to relinquish the
object of her superstition. To her stratagem she also adds lying words, so that
she deserves manifold censure.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>36.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob was wroth, and
chode with Laban</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Jacob again acts amiss, in
contending with Laban about a matter not sufficiently known, and in wrongfully
fastening on him the charge of calumny. For although he supposed all his family
to be free from blame, yet he was deceived by his own negligence. He acts,
indeed, with moderation, because in expostulating with Laban he does not use
reproaches; but in this he is not to be excused, that he undertakes the cause of
his whole family, when they were not exempt from blame. If any one should make
the objection to this statement, that Jacob was constrained by fear, because
Laban had brought with him a great band of companions: the circumstances
themselves show, that his mind was thus influenced by moderation rather than by
fear. For he boldly resists, and shows no sign of fear; only he abstains from
the insolence of evil speaking. He then adds that he had just cause of
accusation against Laban; not because he wished to rise in a spirit of
recrimination against his father-in-law; but because it was right that the
kindred and associates of Laban should be made witnesses of all that had passed,
in order that, by the protracted patient endurance of Jacob, his integrity might
be the more manifest. Jacob also calls to mind, not only that he had been a
faithful keeper of the flock, but also that his labor had been rendered
prosperous by the blessing of God; he adds, besides, that he had been held
accountable for all losses. In this he insinuates against Laban the charge of
great injustice: for it was not the duty of Jacob voluntarily to inflame the
avarice and rapacity of his father-in-law, by attempting to soothe him; but he
yielded, by constraint, to his injuries. When he says that sleep departed from
his eyes, he not only intimates that he passed sleepless nights, but that he had
so contended against nature itself, as to defraud himself of necessary
repose.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>42.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Except the God of my
father</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Jacob here ascribes it to the favor of
God, that he was not about to return home entirely empty; whereby he not only
aggravates the sin of Laban, but meets an objection which might seem at variance
with his complaints. He therefore denies that he has been made rich by the
kindness of his father-in-law; but testifies that he has been favourably
regarded by the Lord: as if he had said, I owe it not to thee, that thou hast
not further injured me; but God, who is propitious to me, has withstood thee.
Now, since God is not the defender of unfaithfulness, nor is wont to help the
wicked, the integrity of Jacob may be ascertained from the fact that God
interposed as his vindicator. It is also to be observed, that by expressly
distinguishing the God of Abraham from all fictitious gods, he declares that
there is no other true God: by which he, at the same time, proves himself to be
a truly pious worshipper. The expression "the fear of Isaac," is to be taken
passively for the God whom Isaac revered; just as, on account of the reverence
due to him, he is called the "fear and the dread" of his people. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F552</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
A similar expression occurs immediately after, in the same chapter. Now the
pious, while they fear God, are by no means horror &#8212; struck at his
presence, like the reprobates; but trembling at his judgment, they walk
circumspectly before him.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God
has seen my affliction, and the labor of my
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This was spoken from a pious feeling
that God would bring help to him when afflicted, if he should conduct himself
with fidelity and honesty. Therefore, in order that the Lord may sustain us with
his favor, let us learn to discharge our duty rightly; let us not flee from our
proper work; and let us not refuse to purchase peace by submitting to many
inconveniences. Further, if they from whom we have deserved well treat us
severely and unjustly, let us bear our cross in hope and in silence, until the
Lord shall succor us: for he will never forsake us, as the whole Scripture
testifies. But Jacob distinctly presses his father-in-law with his own
confession. For why had God rebuked him, unless because he was persecuting an
innocent man in defiance of justice and equity; for as I have lately intimated,
it is abhorrent to the nature of God to favor evil and unjust
causes.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>43.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These daughters are my
daughters</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Laban begins now to speak in a
manner very different from before: he sees that he has no farther ground of
contention. Therefore, being convinced, he buries all strife, and glides into
placid and amicable discourse. "Why," he asks, "should I be hostile to thee,
when all things between us are common? Shall I rage against my own bowels? For
both thy wives and thy children are my own blood; wherefore I ought to be
affected towards you, as if you all were part of myself." 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F553</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He now answers like an honorable man. Whence, then, has this humanity so
suddenly sprung up in the breast of him who lately had been hurried onward,
without any respect to right or wrong, to ruin Jacob; unless it were, that he
knew Jacob to have acted towards him with fidelity, and to have been at length
compelled by necessity to adopt the design of departing by stealth? And this was
an indication that he was not absolutely desperate: for we may find many persons
of such abandoned impudence, that though overcome and silenced by arguments,
they yet do not cease to rush headlong in insane rebellion. From this passage we
infer, that although avarice and other sinful affections take away judgment and
soundness of mind; there yet remains a knowledge of truth engraven on the souls
of men, which being stirred up emits scintillations, to prevent the universal
triumph of depravity. If any one before had said, What does thou, Laban? What
brutality is this to rage against thine own bowels? the remonstrance would not
have been heard, for he burned with headstrong fury. But now he voluntarily
suggests this to himself, and proclaims what he would have been unwilling to
hear from another. It appears, then, that the light of justice which now breaks
forth, had been smothered in his mind. In short, it is self-love alone which
blinds us; because we all judge aright where personal interests are not
concerned. If, however, it should so happen that we are for a time in
perplexity, we must still seek to obey the dictates of reason and justice. But
if any one hardens himself in wickedness, the interior and hidden knowledge, of
which I have spoken, will yet remain engraven in his mind, and will suffice for
his condemnation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>44.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let us make a covenant, I and
thou</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Laban here acts as men conscious of guilt
are wont to do, when they wish to guard themselves against revenge: and this
kind of trepidation and anxiety is the just reward of evil deeds. Besides,
wicked men always judge of others from their own disposition: whence it happens
that they have fears on all sides. Moses before relates a somewhat similar
example, when Abimelech made a covenant with Isaac. Wherefore we must take the
greater care, if we desire to possess tranquil minds, that we act sincerely and
without injury towards our neighbors. Meanwhile Moses shows how placable Jacob
was, and how easily he permitted himself to be conciliated. He had endured very
many and grievous wrongs; but now, forgetting all, he freely stretches out the
hand of kindness: and so far is he from being pertinacious in defending his own
right, that he, in a manner, anticipates Laban himself, being the first to take
a stone, and set it up for a pillar. And truly it becomes the children of God,
not only with alacrity to embrace peace, but even ardently to search for it, as
we are commanded in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193414&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
34:14. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F554</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
As to the heap of stones, it was always the practice to use some ceremony which
might confirm the compact on both sides; on this occasion a heap of stones is
raised, in order that the memory of the covenant might be transmitted to
posterity. That Jacob took part in this was a proof, as we have said, of a mind
disposed to peace. He freely complained, indeed, when it was right to do so; but
when the season of pacification arrived, he showed that he cherished no rancour.
Moses, in relating afterwards that they did eat there, upon the heap, does not
observe the order of the history. For, on both sides, the conditions of the
covenant were agreed upon and declared, before the feast was celebrated: but
this figure of speech (as we have before seen) was sufficiently in
use.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>47.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Laban called
it</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Each, in his own language, gives a name, of
the same signification, to the heap. Whence it appears, that Laban used the
Syrian tongue, though born of the race of Heber. But it is not wonderful that
he, dwelling among Syrians, should have accustomed himself to the language as
well as to the manners of the Syrians. And a little before, he is twice called a
Syrian; as if Moses would describe him as degenerate, and alienated from the
Hebrews. But this seems by no means accordant with the previous history, where
we read that the daughters of Laban gave Hebrew names to their sons. Yet the
solution is not difficult; for since the affinity between these languages was
great, the inflection of one word into another was easy: besides, if the wives
of Jacob were tractable, it is not surprising that they should have learned his
language. And beyond doubt, he would himself make a point of this matter: seeing
he knew that his family was separated from the rest of the nations. Moses, in
using the name of Galeed, does it proleptically; for since he was writing for
his own times, he does not scruple to give it the generally received name.
Moreover we hence infer, that ceremonies and rites ought to refer to that which
those who use them mutually agree upon. Which rule also ought to be applied to
the sacraments; because if the word by which God enters into covenant with us be
taken away, useless and dead figures will alone
remain.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>49.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord watch between me and
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Laban commits to the judgment of God, for
vengeance, whatever offense either of them should be guilty of against the other
in his absence; as if he would say, "Though the knowledge of the injury should
not reach me, because I shall be far distant, yet the Lord, who is everywhere
present, will behold it." Which sentiment he more clearly expresses afterwards,
when he says, "No one is with us; God will be witness between me and thee." By
which words he means, that God will be a severe avenger of every wickedness,
though there should be no judge upon earth to decide the cause. And certainly if
there were any religion flourishing within us, the presence of God would
influence us far more than the observation of men. But it arises from the brutal
stupidity of our flesh, that we reverence men only; as if we might mock God with
impunity, when we are not convicted by the testimony of men. If, then, this
common feeling of nature dictated to Laban, that the frauds which were hidden
from men would come into judgment before God; we who enjoy the light of the
gospel should indeed be ashamed to seek a covert for our fallacies. Hence also,
we gather the legitimate use of an oath, which the Apostle declares in his
epistle to the Hebrews; namely, that men, in order to put an end to their
controversies, resort to the judgment of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>50.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If thou shalt take other
wives besides my daughters</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Laban declares that
it would be a species of perfidy, if Jacob should take to himself any other
wives. But he had himself compelled Jacob to the act of polygamy: for whence was
it that the holy man had more wives than one, except that Leah had been craftily
substituted in the place of Rachel? But he now, from a pure sentiment of nature,
condemns the fault, of which, blinded by avarice, he had wickedly been the
author. And certainly, when the bond of marriage is broken, than which none
among men is more sacred, the whole of human society sinks into decay.
Wherefore, those fanatical men, who, at this day, delight to defend polygamy,
have no need of any other judge than
Laban.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>53.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The God of
Abraham</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is indeed rightly and properly
done, that Laban should adjure Jacob by the name of God. For this is the
confirmation of covenants; to appeal to God on both sides, that he may not
suffer perfidy to pass unpunished. But he sinfully blends idols with the true
God, between whom there is nothing in common. Thus, truly, men involved in
superstitions, are accustomed to confound promiscuously sacred things with
profane, and the figments of men with the true God. He is compelled to give some
honor to the God of Abraham, yet he lies plunged in his own idolatrous
pollution; and, that his religion may not appear the worse, he gives it the
color of antiquity. For in calling him the God of his father, he boasts that
this God was handed down to him from his ancestors. Meanwhile Jacob does not
swear superstitiously. For Moses expressly declares, that he sware only by "the
fear of Isaac;" whence we learn that he did not assent to the preposterous form
of oath dictated by his father-in-law; no too many do, who, in order to gain the
favor of the wicked, pretend to be of the same religion with them. But when once
the only God is made known to us, we wickedly suppress his truth, unless by its
light all the clouds of error are
dispersed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>54.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And called his brethren to
eat bread</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In courteously receiving his
kindred, by whom he had been ill-treated, as his guests, Jacob showed his
kindness. Moses also intimates that it was by the special favor of God that,
after the most dreadful storm which threatened the holy man with destruction, a
placid serenity suddenly shone forth. To the same cause is to be assigned what
immediately follows, that Laban departed in a friendly manner: for by this
method the Lord openly manifested himself as the guardian of his servant, seeing
that he wonderfully delivered him as a lost sheep out of the jaws of the wolf.
And truly, not only was the fury of Laban appeased; but he put on paternal
affection, as if he had been changed into a new
man.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>55.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And blessed
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The character of the person is here to be
noticed, because Laban, who had lapsed from true piety, and was a man of unholy
and wicked manners, yet retained the habit of giving his blessing. For we are
hereby taught, that certain principles of divine knowledge remain in the hearts
of the wicked, so that no excuse may be left to them on the ground of ignorance;
for the custom of pronouncing a blessing arises hence, that men are certainly
persuaded that God alone is the author of all good things. For although they may
proudly arrogate what they please to themselves; yet when they return to their
right mind, they are compelled, whether they will or no, to acknowledge that all
good proceeds from God alone.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob went on his
way</i></font><font face="Palatino">. After Jacob has escaped from the hands of
his father-in-law, that is, from present death, he meets with his brother, whose
cruelty was as much, or still more, to be dreaded; for by the threats of this
brother he had been driven from his country; and now no better prospect lies
before him. He therefore proceeds with trepidation, as one who goes to the
slaughter. Seeing, however, it was scarcely possible but that he should sink
oppressed by grief, the Lord affords him timely succor; and prepares him for
this conflict, as well as for others, in such a manner that he should stand
forth a brave and invincible champion in them all. Therefore, that he may know
himself to be defended by the guardianship of God, angels go forth to meet him,
arranged in ranks on both sides. Hebrew interpreters think that the camp of the
enemy had been placed on one side; and that the angels, or rather God, stood on
the other. But it is much more probable, that angels were distributed in two
camps on different sides of Jacob, that he might perceive himself to be
everywhere surrounded and fortified by celestial troops; as in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
34:7, it is declared that angels, to preserve the worshippers of God, pitch
their tents around them. Yet I am not dissatisfied with the opinion of those who
take the dual number simply for the plural; understanding that Jacob was
entirely surrounded with an army of angels. Now the use of this vision was
twofold; for, first, since the holy man was very anxious about the future, the
Lord designed early to remove this cause of terror from him; or, at least, to
afford him some alleviation, lest he should sink under temptation. Secondly, God
designed, when Jacob should have been delivered from his brother, so to fix the
memory of the past benefit in his mind, that it should never be lost. We know
how prone men are to forget the benefits of God. Even while God is stretching
out his hand to help them, scarcely one out of a hundred raises his eyes towards
heaven. Therefore it was necessary that the visible protection of God should be
placed before the eyes of the holy man; so that, as in a splendid theater, he
might perceive that he had been lately delivered, not by chance, out of the hand
of Laban; but that he had the angels of God fighting for him; and might
certainly hope, that their help would be ready for him against the attempts of
his brother; and finally, that, when the danger was surmounted, he might
remember the protection he had received from them. This doctrine is of use to us
all, that we may learn to mark the invisible presence of God in his manifested
favors. Chiefly, however, it was necessary that the holy man should be furnished
with new weapons to endure the approaching contest. He did not know whether his
brother Esau had been changed for the better or the worse. But he would rather
incline to the suspicion that the sanguinary man would devise nothing but what
was hostile. Therefore the angels appear for the purpose of confirming his faith
in future, not less than for that of calling past favors to his remembrance. The
number of these angels also encourages him not a little: for although a single
angel would suffice as a guardian for us, yet the Lord acts more liberally
towards us. Therefore they who think that each of us is defended by one angel
only, wickedly depreciate the kindness of God. And there is no doubt that the
devil, by this crafty device, has endeavored, in some measure, to diminish our
faith. The gratitude of the holy man is noted by Moses, in the fact that he
assigns to the place a name, (Galeed,) as a token of perpetual
remembrance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob sent
messengers</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It now happened, by the providence
of God, that Esau, having left his father, had gone to Mount Seir of his own
accord; and had thus departed from the land of promise, by which means the
possession of it would remain void for the posterity of Jacob, without slaughter
among brethren. For it was not to be believed that he had changed his
habitation, either because he was compelled by his father's command, or because
he was willing to be accounted inferior to his brother. I rather conjecture that
he had become greatly enriched, and that this induced him to leave his father's
house. For we know that profane persons and men of this world so vehemently pant
for present advantages, that when anything offers itself in accordance with
their desire, they are hurried towards it with a brutish impetuosity. Esau was
imperious and ferocious; he was incensed against his mother; had shaken off all
reverence for his father, and knew that he was himself also obnoxious to them
both: his wives were engaged in incessant contentions; it seemed to him hard and
troublesome, to be in the condition of a child in the family, when he was now
advancing to old age; for proud men do not regard themselves as free, so long as
any one has the preeminence over them. Therefore, in order to pass his life free
from the authority of others, he chose to live in a state of separation from his
father; and, allured by this attraction, he disregarded the promised
inheritance, and left the place for his brother. I have said that this was done
by the divine will: for God himself declares by Malachi, that it was by a
species of banishment that Esau was led to Mount Seir.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;390103&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
1:3) 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F555</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For although he departed voluntarily, yet, by the secret counsel of God was he
deprived of that land which he had earnestly desired. But, attracted by the
present lust of dominion, he was blinded in his choice; since the land of Seir
was mountainous and rugged, destitute of fertility and pleasantness. Moreover,
he would appear to himself a great man, in giving his own name to the country.
Nevertheless, it is probable that Moses called that country the land of Edom by
the figure <i>prolepsis</i>, because it afterwards began to be so called. The
question now occurs, Whence did Jacob know that his brother dwelt in that
region? Though I assert nothing as certain; yet the conjecture is probable, that
he had been informed of it by his mother; for, in the great number of her
servants, a faithful messenger would not be wanting. And it is easily gathered
from the words of Moses, that Jacob, before he had entered the land, knew the
fact respecting the new residence of his brother. And we know that many things
of this kind were omitted by Moses, which may easily suggest themselves to the
mind of the reader.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus shall ye speak unto my lord
Esau</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses here relates the anxiety of Jacob
to appease his brother. For this suppliant deprecation was extorted only by
great and severe torture of mind. It seems, however, to be an absurd submission,
whereby he cedes to his brother that dominion for which he had contended at the
hazard of his life. For if Esau has the primogeniture, what does Jacob reserve
for himself? For what end did he bring upon himself such hatred, expose himself
to such dangers, and at length endure twenty years of banishment, if he does not
refuse to be in subjection to his brother? I answer, that though he gives up the
temporal dominion, he yields nothing of his right to the secret benediction. He
knows that the effect of the divine promise is still suspended: and therefore,
being content with the hope of the future inheritance, he does not hesitate, at
present, to prefer his brother in honor to himself, and to profess himself his
brother's servant. Nor was there anything feigned in these words; because he was
willing to bear his brother on his shoulders; so that he might not lose his own
future right, which was as yet
concealed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have
oxen</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Jacob does not proclaim his riches for
the sake of boasting, but that by this method Esau might be inclined to
humanity. For it would have been exceedingly disgraceful, cruelly to drive away
one who had been enriched, by the favor of God, in a distant land. Besides, he
cuts off occasion of future emulation: for if he had come empty and famishing,
Esau might conceive fresh indignation against him, through fear of the expense
which might be entailed on himself. Therefore Jacob declares, that he does not
come for the purpose of consuming his father's substance, nor of being made rich
by his brother's ruin: as if he had said, "Let thy earthly inheritance be
secure; thy claim shall not be injured by me; only suffer me to live." By this
example we are taught in what way we are to cultivate peace with the wicked. The
Lord does not indeed forbid us to defend our own right, so far as our
adversaries allow; but we must rather recede from that right, than originate
contention by our own fault.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the messengers
returned</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Esau advances to meet his brother
with a feeling of benevolence: but Jacob, reflecting on his cruel ferocity,
inflated spirits, and savage threats, expects no humanity from him. And the Lord
willed that the mind of his servant should be oppressed by this anxiety for a
time, although without any real cause, in order the more to excite the fervor of
his prayer. For we know what coldness, on this point, security engenders.
Therefore, lest our faith, being stirred up by no stimulants, should become
torpid, God often suffers us to fear things which are not terrible in
themselves. For although he anticipates our wishes, and opposes our evils, he
yet conceals his remedies until he has exercised our faith. Meanwhile it is to
be noted, that the sons of God are never endued with a constancy so steadfast,
that the infirmity of the flesh does not betray itself in them. For they who
fancy that faith is exempt from all fear, have had no experience of the true
nature of faith. For God does not promise that he will be present with us for
the purpose of removing the sense of our dangers, but in order that fear may not
prevail, and overwhelm us in despair. Moreover our faith is never so firm at
every point, as to repel wicked doubts and sinful fears, in the way that might
be wished.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he divided the
people</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses relates that Jacob formed his
plans according to the existing state of affairs. He divides his family into two
parts, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F556</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and puts his maids in the foremost place, that they may bear the first assault,
if necessary; but he places his free wives further from the danger. Hence indeed
we gather, that Jacob was not so overcome with fear as to be unable to arrange
his plans. We know that when a panic seizes the mind, it is deprived of
discretion; and they who ought to look after their own concerns, become stupid
and inanimate. Therefore it proceeded from the spirit of faith that Jacob
interposed a certain space between the two parts of his family, in order that if
any destruction approached, the whole seed of the Church might not perish. For
by this scheme, he offered the half of his family to the slaughter, that, at
length, the promised inheritance might come to the remainder who
survived.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O God of my father
Abraham</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Having arranged his affairs as the
necessity of the occasion suggested, he now retakes himself to prayer. And this
prayer is evidence that the holy man was not so oppressed with fear as to
prevent faith from proving victorious. For he does not, in a hesitating manner,
commend himself and his family to God; but trusting both to God's promises and
to the benefits already received, he casts his cares and his troubles into his
heavenly Father's bosom. We have declared before, what is the point aimed at in
assigning these titles to God; in calling God the God of his fathers Abraham and
Isaac, and what the terms mean; namely, that since men are so far removed from
God, that they cannot, by their own power, ascend to his throne, he himself
comes down to the faithful. God in thus calling himself the God of Abraham and
Isaac, graciously invites their son Jacob to himself: for, access to the God of
his fathers was not difficult to the holy man. Again, since the whole world had
sunk under superstition, God would have himself to be distinguished from all
idols, in order that he might retain an elect people in his own covenant. Jacob,
therefore, in expressly addressing God as the God of his fathers, places fully
before himself the promises given to him in their person, that he may not pray
with a doubtful mind, but may securely rely on this stay, that the heir of the
promised blessing will have God propitious towards him. And indeed we must seek
the true rule of prayer in the word of God, that we may not rashly break through
to Him, but may approach him in the manner in which he has revealed himself to
us. This appears more clearly from the adjoining context, where Jacob, recalling
the command and promise of God to memory, is supported as by two pillars.
Certainly the legitimate method of praying is, that the faithful should answer
to God who calls them; and thus there is such a mutual agreement between his
word and their vows, that no sweeter and more harmonious symphony can be
imagined. "O Lord," he says, "I return at thy command: thou also didst promise
protection to me returning; it is therefore right that thou shouldest become the
guide of my journey." This is a holy boldness, when, having discharged our duty
according to God's calling, we familiarly ask of him whatsoever he has promised;
since he, by binding himself gratuitously to us, becomes in a sense voluntarily
our debtor. But whoever, relying on no command or promise of God, offers his
prayers, does nothing but cast vain and empty words into the air. This passage
gives stronger confirmation to what has been said before, that Jacob did not
falsely pretend to his wives, that God had commanded him to return. For if he
had then spoken falsely, no ground of hope would now be left to him. But he does
not scruple to approach the heavenly tribunal with this confidence, that he
shall be protected by the hand of God, under whose auspices he had ventured to
return to the land of Canaan.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am not worthy of the least
of all the mercies</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F557</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Although this expression sounds harsh to Latin ears, the sense is not obscure.
Jacob confesses, that greater mercies of God had been heaped upon him than he
had dared to hope for: and therefore, far be it from him that he should plead
anything of dignity or merit, for the purpose of obtaining what he asks. He
therefore says, that he is less than God's favors; because he felt himself to be
unworthy of those excellent gifts which the Lord had so liberally bestowed upon
him. Moreover, that the design of the holy patriarch may more clearly appear,
the craft of Satan is to be observed: for, in order to deter us from praying,
through a sense of our unworthiness, he would suggest to us this thought, "Who
art thou that thou shouldst dare to enter into the presence of God?" Jacob early
anticipates this objection, in declaring beforehand that he is unworthy of God's
former gifts, and at the same time acknowledges that God is not like men, in
ever becoming weary to continue and increase his acts of kindness. Meanwhile,
Jacob collects materials for confidence from the fact, that he has so often
found God benignant towards him. Therefore, he had a double end in view; first,
because he wished to counteract the distrust which might steal upon him in
consequence of the magnitude of God's gifts; and then, he turns those gifts to a
different purpose, to assure himself that God would be the same to him that he
had hitherto been. He uses two words, <i>mercies</i> and <i>truth</i>, to show
that God is inclined by his mere goodness to benefit us; and in this way proves
his own faithfulness. This combination of mercy with truth frequently occurs in
the Scriptures, to teach us that all good things flow to us through the
gratuitous favor of God; but that we are made capable of receiving them, when by
faith we embrace his
promises.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For with my
staff</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F558</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Jacob does not enumerate separately the mercies of God, but under one species
comprises the rest; namely, that whereas he had passed over Jordan, a poor and
solitary traveler, he now returns rich, and replenished with abundance. The
antithesis between a <i>staff</i> and <i>two troops</i> is to be noticed; in
which he compares his former solitude and poverty with his present
affluence.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Deliver
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. After he has declared himself to be bound
by so many of God's benefits that he cannot boast of his own merits, and thus
raised his mind to higher expectation, he now mentions his own necessity, as if
he would say, "O Lord, unless thou choosest to reduce so many excellent gifts to
nothing, now is the time for thee to succor one, and to avert the destruction
which, through my brother, is suspended over me." But having thus expressed his
fear, he adds a clause concerning the blessing promised him, that he may confirm
himself in the promises made to him.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To slay the mother with the
children</i></font><font face="Palatino">, I suppose to have been a proverbial
saying among the Jews, which means to leave nothing remaining. It is a metaphor
taken from birds, when hawks seize the young with their dams, and empty the
whole nest.

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And took of that which came
to his hand</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In endeavoring to appease his
brother by presents, he does not act distrustfully, as if he doubted whether he
should be safe under the protection of God. This, indeed, is a fault too common
among men, that when they have prayed to God, they turn themselves hither and
thither, and contrive vain subterfuges for themselves: whereas the principal
advantage of prayer is, to wait for the Lord in silence and quietness. But the
design of the holy man was not to busy and to vex himself, as one discontented
with the sole help of God. For although he was certainly persuaded that to have
God propitious to him would alone be sufficient, yet he did not omit the use of
the means which were in his power, while leaving success in the hand of God. For
though by prayer we cast our cares upon God, that we may have peaceful and
tranquil minds; yet this security ought not to render us indolent. For the Lord
will have all the aids which he affords us applied to use. But the diligence of
the pious differs greatly from the restless activity of the world; because the
world, relying on its own industry, independently of the blessing of God, does
not consider what is right or lawful; moreover it is always in trepidation, and
by its bustling, increases more and more its own disquietude. The pious,
however, hoping for the success of their labor, only from the mercy of God,
apply their minds in seeking out means, for this sole reason, that they may not
bury the gifts of God by their own torpor. When they have discharged their duty,
they still depend on the same grace of God; and when nothing remains which they
can attempt, they nevertheless are at
rest.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Two hundred
she-goats</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Hence we perceive the value which
Jacob set upon the promise given to him, seeing he does not refuse to make so
great a sacrifice of his property. We know that those things which are obtained
with great toil and trouble are the more highly esteemed. So that generally they
who are enriched by their own labor are proportionally sparing and tenacious. It
was, however, no trivial diminution even of great wealth, to give forty cows,
thirty camels with their young, twenty bulls, and as many asses with their
foals, two hundred she-goats, and as many sheep, with twenty rams, and the same
number of he-goats. But Jacob freely lays upon himself this tax, that he may
obtains a safe return to his own country. Certainly it would not have been
difficult to find some nook where he might live with his property entire: and an
equally commodious habitations might have been found elsewhere. But, that he
might not lose the benefit of the promise, he purchases, at so great a price,
from his brother, a peaceable abode in the land of Canaan. Therefore should we
be ashamed of our effeminacy and tardiness, who wickedly turn aside from the
duty of our calling, as soon as any loss is to be sustained. With a clear and
loud voice the Lord commands us to do what he pleases; but some, because they
find it troublesome to take up their burdens, lie in idleness; pleasures also
keep back some; riches or honors impede others; finally, few follow God, because
scarcely one in a hundred will bear to be losers. In putting a space between the
messengers, and in sending them at different times from each other, he does it
to mitigate by degrees the ferocity of his brother: Whence we infer again, that
he was not so seized with fear, as to be unable prudently to order his
affairs.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he rose up that
night</i></font><font face="Palatino">. After he has prayed to the Lord, and
arranged his plans, he now takes confidence and meets the danger. By which
example the faithful are taught, that whenever any danger approaches, this order
of proceeding is to be observed; first, to resort directly to the Lord;
secondly, to apply to immediate use whatever means of help may offer themselves;
and thirdly, as persons prepared for any event, to proceed with intrepidity
whithersoever the Lord commands. So Jacob, that he might not fail in this
particular, does not dread the passage which he perceives to be full of hazard,
but, as with closed eyes, pursues his course. Therefore, after his example, we
must overcome anxiety in intricate affairs, lest we should be hindered or
retarded in our duty. He remains alone, &#8212; having sent forward his wives
and children, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F560</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8212; not that he might himself escape if he heard of their destruction, but
because solitude was more suitable for prayer. And there is no doubt that,
fearing the extremity of his peril, he was completely carried away with the
ardor of supplication to God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There wrestled a man with
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F561</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Although this vision was particularly useful to Jacob himself, to teach him
beforehand that many conflicts awaited him, and that he might certainly conclude
that he should be the conqueror in them all; there is yet not the least doubt
that the Lord exhibited, in his person, a specimen of the temptations &#8212;
common to all his people &#8212; which await them, and must be constantly
submitted to, in this transitory life. Wherefore it is right to keep in view
this designs of the vision, which is to represent all the servants of God in
this world as wrestlers; because the Lord exercises them with various kinds of
conflicts. Moreover, it is not said that Satan, or any mortal man, wrestled with
Jacob, but God himself: to teach us that our faith is tried by him; and whenever
we are tempted, our business is truly with him, not only because we fight under
his auspices, but because he, as an antagonist, descends into the arena to try
our strength. This, though at first sight it seems absurd, experience and reason
teaches us to be true. For as all prosperity flows from his goodness, so
adversity is either the rod with which he corrects our sins, or the test of our
faith and patience. And since there is no kind of temptations by which God does
not try his faithful people, the similitude is very suitable, which represents
him as coming, hand to hand, to combat with them. Therefore, what was once
exhibited under a visible form to our father Jacob, is daily fulfilled in the
individual members of the Church; namely, that, in their temptations, it is
necessary for them to wrestle with God. He is said, indeed, to tempt us in a
different manner from Satan; but because he alone is the Author of our crosses
and afflictions, and he alone creates light and darkness, (as is declared in
Isaiah,) he is said to tempt us when he makes a trial of our faith. But the
question now occurs, Who is able to stand against an Antagonist, at whose breath
alone all flesh perishes and vanishes away, at whose look the mountains melt, at
whose word or beck the whole world is shaken to pieces, and therefore to attempt
the least contest with him would be insane temerity? But it is easy to untie the
knot. For we do not fight against him, except by his own power, and with his own
weapons; for he, having challenged us to this contest, at the same time
furnishes us with means of resistance, so that he both fights <i>against</i> us
and <i>for</i> us. In short, such is his apportioning of it is conflict, that,
while he assails us with one hand, he defends us with the other; yea, inasmuch
as he supplies us with more strength to resist than he employs in opposing us,
we may truly and properly say, that he fights <i>against</i> us with his
<i>left</i> hand, and <i>for</i> us with his <i>right</i> hand. For while he
lightly opposes us, he supplies invincible strength whereby we overcome. It is
true he remains at perfect unity with himself: but the double method in which he
deals with us cannot be otherwise expressed, than that in striking us with a
human rod, he does not put forth his full strength in the temptation; but that
in granting the victory to our faith, he becomes in us stronger than the power
by which he opposes us. And although these forms of expression are harsh, yet
their harshness will be easily mitigated in practice. For if temptations are
contests, (and we know that they are not accidental, but are divinely appointed
for us,) it follows hence, that God acts in the character of an antagonist, and
on this the rest depends; namely, that in the temptation itself he appears to be
weak <i>against</i> us, that he may conquer <i>in</i> us. Some restrict this to
one kind of temptation only, where God openly and avowedly manifests himself as
our adversary, as if armed for our destruction. And truly, I confess, that this
differs from common conflicts, and requires, beyond all others, a rare, and even
heroic strength. Yet I include willingly every kind of conflict in which God
exercises the faithful: since in all they have God for an antagonist, although
he may not openly proclaim himself hostile unto them. That Moses here calls
<i>him</i> a man whom a little after he declares to have been God, is a
sufficiently usual form of speech. For since God appeared under the form of a
man, the name is thence assumed; just as, because of the visible symbol, the
Spirit is called a dove; and, in turn, the name of the Spirit is transferred to
the dove. That this disclosure was not sooner made to the holy man, I understand
to be for this reason, because God had resolved to call him, as a soldier,
robust and skillful in war, to more severe contests. For as raw recruits are
spared, and young oxen are not immediately yoked to the plough; so the Lord more
gently exercises his own people, until, having gathered strength, they become
more inured to toil. Jacob, therefore, having been accustomed to bear
sufferings, is now led forth to real war. Perhaps also, the Lord had reference
to the conflict which was then approaching. But I think Jacob was admonished, at
his very entrance on the promised land, that he was not there to expect a
tranquil life for himself. For his return to his own country might seem to be a
kind of release; and thus Jacob, like a soldier who had kept his term of
service, would have given himself up to repose. Wherefore it was highly
necessary for him to be taught what his future conditions should be. We, also,
are to learn from him, that we must fight during the whole course of our life;
lest any one, promising himself rest, should wilfully deceive himself. And this
admonition is very needful for us; for we see how prone we are to sloth. Whence
it arises, that we shall not only be thinking of a truce in perpetual war; but
also of peace in the heat of the conflict, unless the Lord rouse
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when he saw that he
prevailed not against him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here is described to
us the victory of Jacob, which, however, was not gained without a wound. In
saying that the wrestling angel, or God, wished to retire from the contest,
because he saw he should not prevail, Moses speaks after the manner of men. For
we know that God, when he descends from his majesty to us, is wont to transfer
the properties of human nature to himself. The Lord knew with certainty the
event of the contest, before he came down to engage in it; he had even already
determined what he would do: but his knowledge is here put for the experience of
the thing itself.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He touched
the hollow of his thigh</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Though Jacob gains the
victory; yet the angel strikes him on the thigh, from which cause he was lame
even to the end of his life. And although the vision was by night, yet the Lord
designed this mark of it to continue through all his days, that it might thence
appear not to have been a vain dream. Moreover, by this sign it is made manifest
to all the faithful, that they can come forth conquerors in their temptations,
only by being injured and wounded in the conflict. For we know that the strength
of God is made perfect in our weakness, in order that our exaltation may be
joined with humility; for if our own strength remained entire, and there were no
injury or dislocation produced, immediately the flesh would become haughty, and
we should forget that we had conquered by the help of God. But the wound
received, and the weakness which follows it, compel us to be
modest.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let me
go</i></font><font face="Palatino">. God concedes the praise of victory to his
servant, and is ready to depart, as if unequal to him in strength: not because a
truce was needed by him, to whom it belongs to grant a truce or peace whenever
he pleases; but that Jacob might rejoice over the grace afforded to him. A
wonderful method of triumphing; where the Lord, to whose power all praise is
entirely due, yet chooses that feeble man shall excel as a conqueror, and thus
raises him on high with special eulogy. At the same time he commends the
invincible perseverance of Jacob, who, having endured a long and severe
conflict, still strenuously maintains his ground. And certainly we adopt a
proper mode of contending, when we never grow weary, till the Lord recedes of
his own accord. We are, indeed, permitted to ask him to consider our infirmity,
and, according to his paternal indulgence, to spare the tender and the weak: we
may even groan under our burden, and desire the termination of our contests;
nevertheless, in the meantime, we must beware lest our minds should become
relaxed or faint; and rather endeavor, with collected mind and strength, to
persist unwearied in the conflict. The reason which the angel assigns, namely,
that the day breaketh, is to this effect, that Jacob may now that he has been
divinely taught by the nocturnal vision. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F562</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
will not let thee go, except</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Hence it appears,
that at length the holy man knew his antagonist; for this prayer, in which he
asks to be blessed, is no common prayer. The inferior is blessed by the greater;
and therefore it is the property of God alone to bless us. Truly the father of
Jacob did not otherwise bless him, than by divine command, as one who
represented the person of God. A similar office also was imposed on the priests
under the law, that, as ministers and expositors of divine grace, they might
bless the people. Jacob knew, then, that the combatant with whom he had wrestled
was God; because he desires a blessing from him, which it was not lawful simply
to ask from mortal man. So, in my judgment, ought the place in Hosea
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;281203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
12:3) to be understood, Jacob prevailed over the angel, and was strengthened; he
wept, and made supplication to him. For the Prophet means, that after Jacob had
come off conqueror, he was yet a suppliant before God, and prayed with tears.
Moreover, this passage teaches us always to expect the blessing of God, although
we may have experienced his presence to be harsh and grievous, even to the
disjointing of our members. For it is far better for the sons of God to be
blessed, though mutilated and half destroyed, than to desire that peace in which
they shall fall asleep, or than they should withdraw themselves from the
presence of God, so as to turn away from his command, that they may riot with
the wicked.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy name shall be called no
more Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Jacob, as we have seen, received
his name from his mother's womb, because he had seized the heel of his brother's
foot, and had attempted to hold him back. God now gives him a new and more
honorable name; not that he may entirely abolish the other, which was a token of
memorable grace, but that he may testify a still higher progress of his grace.
Therefore, of the two names the second is preferred to the former, as being more
honorable. The name is derived from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hr&ccedil;
</font><font face="Palatino">(<i>sarah</i>) or
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rw&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>sur</i>,) which signifies to rule, as if he were called a Prince of God: for
I have said, a little before, that God had transferred the praise of his own
strength to Jacob, for the purpose of triumphing in his person. The explanation
of the name which is immediately annexed, is thus given literally by Moses,
"Because thou hast ruled with, or, towards God and towards man, and shalt
prevail." Yet the sense seems to be faithfully rendered by Jerome: 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F563</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but if Jacob acted thus heroically with God, much more should he prove superior
to men; for certainly it was the purpose of God to send forth his servant to
various combats, inspired with the confidence resulting from so great a victory,
lest he should afterwards become vacillating. For he does not merely impose a
name, as risen are accustomed to do, but with the name he gives the thing itself
which the name implies, that the event may correspond with
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Tell me, I pray thee, thy
name</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This seems opposed to what is declared
above; for I have lately said, that when Jacob sought a blessing, it was a token
of his submission. Why, therefore, as if he were of doubtful mind, does he now
inquire the name of him whom he had before acknowledged to be God? But the
solution of the question is easy; for, though Jacob does acknowledge God, yet,
not content will an obscure and slight knowledge, he wishes to ascend higher.
And it is not to be wondered at, that the holy man, to whom God had manifested
himself under so many veils and coverings, that he had not yet obtained any
clear knowledge of him, should break forth in this wish; nay, it is certain that
all the saints, under the law, were inflamed with this desire. Such a prayer
also of Manoah, is read in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;071318&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Judges
13:18, to which the answer from God is added, except that there, the Lord
pronounces his name to be wonderful and secret, in order that Manoah may not
proceed further. The sum therefore is this, that though Jacob's wish was pious,
the Lord does not grant it, because the time of full revelation was not yet
completed: for the fathers, in the beginning, were required to walk in the
twilight of morning; and the Lord manifested himself to them, by degrees, until,
at length, Christ the Sun of Righteousness arose, in whom perfect brightness
shines forth. This is the reason why he rendered himself more conspicuous to
Moses, who nevertheless was only permitted to behold his glory from behind: yet
because he occupied an intermediate place between patriarchs and apostles, he is
said, in comparison with them, to have seen, face to face, the God Who had been
hidden from the fathers. But now, since God has approached more nearly unto us,
our ingratitude is most impious and detestable, if we do not run to meet with
ardent desire to obtain such great grace; as also Peter admonishes us in the
first chapter of his first epistle.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;600112&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 1:12,13.) It is to be observed, that although Jacob piously desires to
know God more fully, yet, because he is carried beyond the bounds prescribed to
the age in which he lived, he suffers a repulse: for the Lord, cutting short his
wish, commands him to rest contented with his own blessing. But if that measure
of illumination which we have received, was denied to the holy man, how
intolerable will be our curiosity, if it breaks forth beyond the contended limit
now prescribed by God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob called the name of
the place</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F564</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The gratitude of our father Jacob is again commended, because he took diligent
care that the memory of God's grace should never perish. He therefore leaves a
monument to posterity, from which they might know that God had appeared there;
for this was not a private vision, but had reference to the whole Church.
Moreover, Jacob not only declares that he has seen the face of God, but also
gives thanks that he has been snatched from death. This language frequently
occurs in the Scriptures, and was common among the ancient people; and not
without reason; for, if the earth trembles at the presence of God, if the
mountains melt, if darkness overspreads the heavens, what must happen to
miserable men! Nay, since the immense majesty of God cannot be comprehended even
by angels, but rather absorbs them; were his glory to shine on us it would
destroy us, and reduce us to nothing, unless he sustained and protected us. So
long as we do not perceive God to be present, we proudly please ourselves; and
this is the imaginary life which the flesh foolishly arrogates to itself when it
inclines towards the earth. But the faithful, when God reveals himself to them,
feel themselves to be more evanescent than any smoke. Finally; would we bring
down the pride of the flesh, we must draw near to God. So Jacob confesses that,
by the special indulgence of God, he had been rescued from destruction when he
saw God. It may however be asked, "Why, when he had obtained so slight a taste
only of God's glory, he should boast that he had seen him, face to face?" I
answer, it is in no way absurd that Jacob highly celebrates this vision above
all others, in which the Lord had not so plainly appeared unto him; and yet, if
it be compared with the splendor of the gospel, or even of the law, it will
appear like sparks, or obscure rays. The simple meaning then is, that he saw God
in an unwonted and extraordinary manner. Now, if Jacob so greatly exults and
congratulates himself in that slender measure of knowledge; what ought we to do
at this day, to whom Christ, the living image of God, is evidently set before
our eyes in the mirror of the gospel! Let us therefore learn to open our eyes,
lest we be blind at noonday, as Paul exhorts us in

Corinthians 3:1-4:1.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he halted upon his
thigh</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is probable, and it may be gathered
even from the words of Moses, that this halting was without the sense of pain,
in order that the miracle might be the more evident. For God, in the flesh of
his servant, has exhibited a spectacle to all ages, from which the faithful may
perceive that no one is such a powerful combatant as not to carry away some
wound after a spiritual convict, for infirmity ever cleaves to all, that no one
may be pleased with himself above measure. Whereas Moses relates that the Jews
abstained from the shrunken sinew, or that part of the thigh in which it was
placed: this was not done out of superstition. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F565</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For that age, as we know, was the infancy of the Church; wherefore the Lord
retained the faithful, who then lived, under the teaching of the schoolmaster.
And now, though, since the coming of Christ, our condition is more free; the
memory of the fact ought to be retained among us, that God disciplined his
people of old by external ceremonies.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob lifted up his
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We have said how greatly Jacob feared for
himself from his brother; but now when Esau himself approaches, his terror is
not only renewed, but increased. For although he goes forth like a courageous
and spirited combatant to this contest, he is still not exempt from a sense of
danger; whence it follows, that he is not free, either from anxiety or fear. For
his cruel brother had still the same cause of hatred against him as before. And
it was not probable, that, after he had left his father's house, and had been
living as he pleased, he had become more mild. Therefore, as in a doubtful
affair, and one of great danger, Jacob placed his wives and children in the
order described; that, if Esau should attempt anything hostile, the whole seed
might not perish, but part might have time for flight. The only thing which
appears to be done by him out of order is, that he prefers Rachel and her son
Joseph to all the rest; whereas the substance of the benediction is really in
Judah. But his excuse in reference to Judah is, that the oracle had not yet been
revealed; nor, in fact, was made known till shortly before his death, in order
that he might become at once its witness and its herald. Meanwhile, it is not to
be denied, that he was excessively indulgent to Rachel. It is, indeed, a proof
of distinguished courage, that, from a desire to preserve a part of his seed, he
precedes his companies, and offers himself as a victim, if necessity demanded
it. For there is no doubt that the promise of God was his authority and his
guide in this design; nor would he have been able, unless sustained by the
contident expectation of celestial life, thus bravely to meet death. It happens,
indeed, sometimes, that a father, regardless of himself, will expose his life to
danger for his children: but holy Jacob's reason was different; for the promise
of God was so deeply fixed in his mind, that he, disregarding the earth, looked
up towards heaven. But while he follows the word of God, yet by the affection of
the flesh, he is slightly drawn aside from the right way. For the faith of the
holy fathers was not so pure, in all respects, but that they were liable to
swerve to one side or the other. Nevertheless, the Spirit always so far
prevailed, that the infirmity of the flesh might not divert them from their aim,
but that they might hold on their course. So much the more ought every one of us
to be suspicious of himself, lest he should deem himself perfectly pure, because
he intends to act rightly; for the flesh ever mingles itself with our holy
purpose, and many faults and corruptions steal in upon us. But God deals kindly
with us, and does not impute faults of this kind to
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And bowed himself to the ground
seven times</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This, indeed, he might do for the
sake of giving honor: for we know that the people of the east are addicted to
far more ceremonies than are in use with us. To me, however, it seems more
probable, that Jacob did not pay this honor simply to his brother, but that he
worshipped God, partly to give him thanks, and partly to implore him to render
his brother propitious; for he is said to have bowed down seven times before he
approached his brother. Therefore, before he came in sight of his brother, he
had already given the token of reverence or worship. Hence we may conjecture, as
I have said, that this homage was paid to God and not to man: yet this is not at
variance with the fact, that he also approached as a suppliant, for the purpose
of assuaging his brother's ferocity by his humiliation. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F566</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
If any one object, that in this manner he depreciated his right of
primogeniture; the answer is easy, that the holy man, by the eyes of faith, was
looking higher; for he knew that the effect of the benediction was deferred to
its proper season, and was, therefore, now like the decaying seed under the
earth. Therefore, although he was despoiled of his patrimony, and lay
contemptible at his brother's feet; yet since he knew that his birthright was
secured to him, he was contented with this latent right, counted honors and
riches as nothing, and did not shrink from being regarded as an inferior in the
presence of his brother.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Esau ran to meet
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. That Esau meets his brother with
unexpected benevolence and kindness, is the effect of the special favor of God.
Therefore, by this method, God proved that he has the hearts of men in his hand,
to soften their hardness, and to mitigate their cruelty as often as he pleases:
in short, that he tames them as wild beasts are wont to be tamed; and then, that
he hearkened to the prayers of his servant Jacob. Wherefore, if at any time the
threats of enemies alarm us, let us learn to resort to this sacred anchor. God,
indeed, works in various ways, and does not always incline cruel minds to
humanity; but, while they rage, he restrains them from doing harm by his own
power: but if it is right, he can as easily render them placable towards us; and
we here see that Esau became so towards his brother Jacob. It is also possible,
that even while cruelty was pent up within, the feeling of humanity may have had
a temporary ascendancy. And as we see that the Egyptians were constrained, for a
moment, to the exercise of humanity, although they were rendered nothing better
than before, as their madness, which soon afterwards broke out, bears witness:
so it is credible that the malice of Esau was now under constraint; and not only
so, but that his mind was divinely moved to put on fraternal affection. For even
in the reprobate, God's established order of nature prevails, not indeed in an
even tenor, but as far as he restrains them, to the end that they may not mingle
all things in one common slaughter. And this is most necessary for the
preservation of the human race. For few are so governed by the spirit of
adoption, as sincerely to cultivate mutual charity among themselves, as
brethren. Therefore, that men spare each other, and do not furiously rush on
each other's destruction, arises from no other cause than the secret providence
of God, which watches for the protection of mankind. But to God the life of his
own faithful people is still more precious, so that he vouchsafes to them
peculiar care. Wherefore it is no wonder, that for the sake of his servant
Jacob, he should have composed the fierce mind of Esau to
gentleness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he lifted up his
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses relates the conversation held
between the brothers. And as Esau had testified his fraternal affection by tears
and embraces, there is no doubt that he inquires after the children in a spirit
of congratulation. The answer of Jacob breathes piety as well as modesty; for
when he replies, that his numerous seed had been given him by God, he
acknowledges and confesses that children are not so produced by nature as to
subvert the truth of the declaration, that the fruit of the womb is a reward and
gift of God. And truly, since the fecundity of brute animals is the gift of God,
how much more is this the case with men, who are created after his own image.
Let parents then learn to consider, and to celebrate the singular kindness of
God, in their offspring. It is the language of modesty, when Jacob calls himself
the servant of his brother. Here again it is proper to recall to memory what I
have lately touched upon, that the holy man caught at nothing either of earthly
advantage or honor in the birthright; because the hidden grace of God was
abundantly sufficient for him, until the appointed time of manifestation. And it
becomes us also, according to his example, while we sojourn in this world, to
depend upon the word of the Lord; that we may not deem it wearisome, to be held
wrapped in the shadow of death, until our real life be manifested. For although
apparently our condition is miserable and accursed, yet the Lord blesses us with
his word; and, on this account only, pronounces us happy, because he owns us as
sons.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then the handmaidens came
near</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The wives of Jacob, having left their
country, had come as exiles into a distant land. Now, at their first entrance,
the terror of death meets them; and when they prostrate themselves in the
presence of Esau, they do not know whether they are not doing homage to their
executioner. This trial was very severe to them, and grievously tormented the
mind of the holy man: but it was right that his obedience should be thus tried,
that he might become an example to us all. Moreover, the Holy Spirit here places
a mirror before us, in which we may contemplate the state of the Church as it
appears in the world. For though many tokens of the divine favor are manifest in
the family of Jacob; nevertheless we perceive no dignity in him while lying with
unmerited contempt in the presence of a profane man. Jacob also himself thinks
that he is well treated, if he may be permitted by his brother, as a matter of
favor, to dwell in the land of which he was the heir and lord. Therefore let us
bear it patiently, if, at this day also, the glory of the Church, being covered
with a sordid veil, is an object of derision to the
wicked.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What meanest thou by all this
drove</i></font><font face="Palatino">? He does not inquire as if he were
altogether ignorant; seeing he had heard from the servants, that oxen and camels
and asses and other cattle were sent him as a present; but for the purpose of
refusing the gift offered to him: for when anything does not please us, we are
wont to make inquiry as concerning a thing unknown to us. Jacob, however; is
urgent; nor does he cease to ask, till he induces his brother to receive the
gift: for this was as a pledge of reconciliation. Besides, for the purpose of
persuading his brother, he declares, that it would be taken as a great kindness
not to refuse what was given. For we do not willingly receive anything but what
we certainly know to be offered to us freely and with a ready mind. And because
it is not possible that we should willingly honor any but those we love, Jacob
says that he rejoiced in the sigh of his brother as if he had seen God or an
angel: by which words he means, not only that he truly loved his brother, but
also that he held him in esteem. But it may seem, that he does wrong to God, in
comparing Him with a reprobate man; and that he speaks falsely, because had the
choice been given him, he would have desired nothing more earnestly than to
avoid this meeting with his brother. Both these knots are easily untied. It is
an accustomed form of speaking among the Hebrews, to call whatever is excellent,
divine. And certainly Esau being thus changed, was no obscure figure of the
favor of God: so that Jacob might properly say, that he had been exhilarated by
that friendly and fraternal reception, as if he had seen God or an angel; that
is, as if God had given some sign of his presence. And, indeed, he does not
speak feignedly, nor pretend something different from what he has in his mind.
For, being himself perfectly free from all hatred, it was his chief wish, to
discharge whatever duty he could towards his brother; provided that Esau, in
return, would show himself a brother to
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Receive my present at my
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This noun may be taken passively as well
as actively. If understood actively, the sense will be, "Accept the present by
which I desire to testify my goodwill towards thee." If understood passively, it
may be referred to God, as if Jacob had said, "Those things which the Lord has
bestowed upon me by his grace, I liberally impart to thee, that thou mayest be,
in some measure, a partaker with me of that divine blessing which I have
received." But not to insist upon a word, Jacob immediately afterwards clearly
avows that whatever he possesses, is not the fruit of his labor or industry, but
has been received by him through the grace of God, and by this reasoning he
attempts to induce his brother to accept the gift; as if he had said, "The Lord
has poured upon me an abundance, of which some part, without any loss to me, may
overflow to thee." And though Jacob thus speaks under the impulse of present
circumstances, he yet makes an ingenuous confession by which he celebrates the
grace of God. Nearly the same words are on the tongues of all; but there are few
who truly ascribe to God what they possess: the greater part sacrifice to their
own industry. Scarcely one in a hundred is convinced, that whatever is good
flows from the gratuitous favor of God; and yet by nature this sense is engraven
upon our minds, but we obliterate it by our ingratitude. It has appeared
already, how labourious was the life of Jacob: nevertheless, though he had
suffered the greatest annoyances, he celebrates only the mercy of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let us take our
journey</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Although Esau was inclined to
benevolence, Jacob still distrusts him: not that he fears to be ensnared, or
that he suspects perfidy to lie hidden under the garb of friendship; but that he
cautiously avoids new occasions of offense: for a proud and ferocious man might
easily be exasperated again by light causes. Now, though just reason for fear
was not wanting to the holy man, yet I dare not deny that his anxiety was
excessive. He suspected the liberality of Esau; but did he not know that a God
was standing between them, who, as he was convinced by clear and undoubted
experience, watched for his salvation? For, whence such an incredible change of
mind in Esau, unless he had been divinely transformed from a wolf into a lamb?
Let us then learn, from this example, to restrain our anxieties, lest when God
has provided for us, we tremble, as in an affair of
doubt.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My lord
knoweth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The things which Jacob alleges, as
grounds of excuse, are true; nevertheless he introduces them under false
pretexts; except, perhaps, as regards the statement, that he was unwilling to be
burdensome and troublesome to his brother. But since he afterwards turns his
journey in another direction, it appears that he feigned something foreign to
what was really in his mind. He says that he brings with him many encumbrances,
and therefore requests his brother to precede him.
"</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
follow</i></font><font face="Palatino">" (he says)
"</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>at the feet of the
children</i></font><font face="Palatino">;" that is, I will proceed gently as
the pace of the children will bear; and thus I will follow at my leisure, until
I come to thee in Mount Seir. In these words he promises what he was not
intending to do; for, leaving his brother, he journeyed to a different place. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F567</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But truth is so precious to God, that he will not allow us to lie or deceive,
even when no injury follows. Wherefore, we must take care, when any fear of
danger occupies our minds, that we do not turn aside to these
subterfuges.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob journeyed to
Succoth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In the word Succoth, as Moses shortly
afterwards shows, there is a prolepsis. It is probable that Jacob rested there
for some days, that he might refresh his family and his flock after the toil of
a long journey; for he had found no quiet resting-place till he came thither.
And therefore he gave to that place the name of Succoth, or "Tents," because he
had not dared firmly to plant his foot elsewhere. For though he had pitched
tents in many other places; yet on this alone he fixes the memorial of divine
grace, because now at length it was granted to him that he might remain in some
abode. But since it was not commodious as a dwelling-place, Jacob proceeded
farther till he came to Sichem. Now, whereas the city has its recent name from
the son of Hamor, its former name is also mentioned,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;013218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
32:18;) for I agree with the interpreters who think Salem to be a proper name.
Although I do not contend, if any one prefers a different interpretation;
namely, that Jacob came <i>in safety</i> to Sichem. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F568</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But though this city may have been called Salem, we must nevertheless observe,
that it was different from the city afterwards called Jerusalem; as there were
also two cities which bore the name of Succoth. As respects the subject in hand,
the purchase of land which Moses records in the nineteenth verse, may seem to
have been absurd. For Abraham would buy nothing all his life but a sepulcher;
and Isaac his son, waiving all immediate possession of lands, was contented with
that paternal inheritance; for God had constituted them lords and heirs of the
land, with this condition, that they should be strangers in it unto death. Jacob
therefore may seem to have done wrong in buying a field for himself with money,
instead of waiting the proper time. I answer, that Moses has not expressed all
that ought to come freely into the mind of the reader. Certainly from the price
we may readily gather that the holy man was not covetous. He pays a hundred
pieces of money; could he acquire for himself large estates at so small a price,
or anything more shall some nook in which he might live without molestation?
Besides, Moses expressly relates that he bought that part on which he had
pitched his tent opposite the city. Therefore he possessed neither meadows, nor
vineyards, nor stable land. But since the inhabitants did not grant him an abode
near the city, he made an agreement with them, and purchased peace at a small
price. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F569</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This necessity was his excuse; so that no one might say, that he had bought from
man what he ought to have expected as the free gift of God: or that, when he
ought to have embraced, by hope, the dominion of the promised land, he had been
in too great haste to enjoy it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he erected there an
altar</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Jacob having obtained a place in which
he might provide for his family, set up the solemn service of God; as Moses
before testified concerning Abraham and Isaac. For although, in every place,
they gave themselves up to the pure worship of God in prayers and other acts of
devotion; nevertheless they did not neglect the external confession of piety,
whenever the Lord granted them any fixed place in which they might remain. For
(as I have elsewhere stated) whenever we read that an altar was built by them,
we must consider its design and use: namely, that they might offer victims, and
might invoke the name of God with a pure rite; so that, by this method, their
religion and faith might be made known. I say this, lest any one should think
that they rashly trifled with the worship of God; for it was their care to
direct their actions according to the divinely prescribed rule which was handed
down to them from Noah and Shem. Wherefore, under the word "altar," let the
reader understand, by <i>synecdoche</i>, the external testimony of piety.
Moreover, it may hence be clearly perceived how greatly the love of divine
worship prevailed in the holy man; because though broken down by various
troubles, he nevertheless was not forgetful of the altar. And not only does he
privately worship God in the secret feeling of his mind; but he exercises
himself in ceremonies which are useful and commanded by God. For he knew that
men want helps, as long as they are in the flesh, and that sacrifices were not
instituted without reason. He had also another purpose; namely, that his whole
family should worship God with the same sense of piety. For it behaves a pious
father of a family diligently to take care that he has no profane house, but
rather that God should reign there as in a sanctuary. Besides, since the
inhabitants of that region had fallen into many superstitions, and had corrupted
the true worship of God, Jacob wished to make a distinction between himself and
them. The Shechemites and other neighboring nations had certainly altars of
their own. Therefore Jacob, by establishing a different method of worship for
his household, thus declares theft he has a God peculiar to himself, and has not
degenerated from the holy fathers, from whom the perfect and genuine religion
had proceeded. This course could not but subject him to reproach, because the
Shechemites and other inhabitants would feel that they were despised: but the
holy man deemed anything preferable to mixing himself with
idolaters.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he called it
El-eloh-Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F570</font></sup><font face="Palatino">This
name appears little suitable to the alter; for it sounds as if a heap of stones
or turf formed a visible statue of God. But the meaning of the holy man was
different. For, because the altar was a memorial and pledge of all the visions
and promises of God., he honors it with this title, to the end that, as often he
beheld the altar, he should call God to rememberance. That inscription of Moses,
"The Lord is my help." Has the same signification; and also that Ezekiel
inscribes on the forms of speaking thereis a want of strict propiety of
metaphor; yet this is not without reason. For as superstitious men foolishly and
wickedly attach God to symbols, andm as it were, draw him down from his heavenly
throne to render him subject to their gross inventions; so the faithful, piously
and rightly, ascend from carthly signs that he worshipped no other God than him
who had been manifested by certain oracles, in order tha he might distinguish
Him from all idols. And we must observe it as a rule of modesty, not to speak
carelessly concerning the mysteries and the glory of the Lord, but from a sense
of fait, so far indeed, as he is made known to us in his word. Moreover Jacob
had respect to his to his prosperity; for since the Lord had appeared to him, on
the express condition, that he would make with him the covenant of salvaation,
Jacob leaves his monument, from which, after his death, his descendants might
ascertain, tat his religion had not flowed from a dark or obscure well, or from
a trubid ppool, but from a clear and pure fountain; as if he had engraved the
oracles and visions, by which he had been taught, upon the
altar.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Dinah... . went
out</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This chapter records a severe contest,
with which God again exercised his servant. how precious the chastity of his
daughter would be to him, we may readily conjecture from the probity of his
whole life. When therefore he heard that she was violated, this disgrace would
inflict the deepest wound of grief upon his mind: yet soon his grief is trebled,
when he hears that his sons, from the desire of revenge, have committed a most
dreadful crime. But let us examine everything in order. Dinah is ravished,
because, having left her father's house, she wandered about more freely than was
proper. She ought to have remained quietly at home, as both the Apostle teaches
and nature itself dictates; for to girls the virtue is suitable, which the
proverb applies to women, that they should be
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">oijkouroi&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">,)
or keepers of the house. Therefore fathers of families are taught to keep their
daughters under strict discipline, if they desire to preserve them free from all
dishonor; for if a vain curiosity was so heavily punished in the daughter of
holy Jacob, not less danger hangs over weak virgins at this day, if they go too
boldly and eagerly into public assemblies, and excite the passions of youth
towards themselves. For it is not to be doubted that Moses in part casts the
blame of the offense upon Dinah herself, when he says, "she went out to see the
daughters of the land;" whereas she ought to have remained under her mother's
eyes in the tent.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And his soul clave unto
Dinah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses intimates that she was not so
forcibly violated, that Shechem having once abused her, treated her with
contempt, as is usual with harlots; for he loved her as a wife; and did not even
object to be circumcised that he might have her; but the fervor of lust had so
prevailed, that he first subjected her to disgrace. And therefore although he
embraced Dinah with real and sincere attachment, yet, in this want of
self-government, he grievously sinned. Shechem "spoke to the heart" of the maid,
that is, he addressed her courteously, to allure her to himself by his bland
speeches: whence it follows, that when she was unwilling and resisted, he used
violence towards her.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Shechem said to his father
Hamor</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In this place it is more clearly
expressed, that Shechem desired to have Dinah for his wife; for his lust was not
so unbridled, that when he had defiled, he despised her. Besides, a laudable
modesty is shown, since he pays deference to the will of his father; for he does
not attempt to form a contract of marriage of his own mind, but leaves this to
his father's authority. For though he had basely fallen through the precipitate
ardor of lust; yet now returning to himself, he follows the guidance of nature.
So much the more ought young men to take heed to themselves, lest in the
slippery period of their age, the lusts of the flesh should impel them to many
crimes. For, at this day, greater license everywhere prevails, so that no
moderation restrains youths from shameful conduct. Since, however, Shechem,
under the rule and direction of nature, desired his father to be the procurer of
his marriage, we hence infer that the right which parents have over their
children is inviolable; so that they who attempt to overthrow it, confound
heaven and earth. Wherefore, since the Pope, in honor of marriage, has dared to
break this sacred bond of nature; this fornicator Shechem alone, will prove a
judge sufficient, and more than sufficient, to condemn that barbarous
conduct.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob
heard</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses inserts a single verse concerning
the silent sorrow of Jacob. We know that they who have not been accustomed to
reproaches, are the more grievously affected when any dishonor happens to them.
Therefore the more this prudent man had endeavored to keep his family pure from
every stain, chaste and well-ordered, the more deeply is he wounded. But since
he is at home alone, he dissembles, and keeps his grief to himself, till his
sons return from the field. Moreover, by this word, Moses does not mean that
Jacob deferred vengeance till their return; but that, being alone and devoid of
counsel and of consolation, he lay prostrate as one disheartened. The sense then
is, that he was so oppressed with insupportable grief, that he held his peace. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F571</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
By using the word "defiled," Moses teaches us what is the true purity of man;
namely, when chastity is religiously cultivated, and every one possesses his
vessel in honor. But whoever prostitutes his body to fornication, filthily
defiles himself. If then Dinah is said to have been polluted, whom Shechem had
forcibly violated, what must be said of voluntary adulterers and
fornicators?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the sons of Jacob came out of
the field</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses begins to relate the tragic
issue of this history. Shechem, indeed, had acted wickedly and impiously; but it
was far more atrocious and wicked that the sons of Jacob should murder a whole
people, to avenge themselves of the private fault of one man. It was by no means
fitting to seek a cruel compensation for the levity and rashness of one youth,
by the slaughter of so many men. Again, who had constituted them judges, that
they should dare, with their own hands, to execute vengeance for an injury
inflicted upon them? Perfidy was also superadded, because they proceeded, under
the pretext of a covenant, to perpetrate this enormous crime. In Jacob,
moreover, we have an admirable example of patient endurance; who, though
afflicted with so many evils, yet did not faint under them. But chiefly we must
consider the mercy of God, by which it came to pass, that the covenant of grace
remained with the posterity of Jacob. For what seemed less suitable, than that a
few men in whom such furious rage and such implacable malice reigned, should be
reckoned among the people and the sons of God, to the exclusion of all the world
besides? We see certainly that it was not through any power of their own that
they had not altogether declined from the kingdom of God. Whence it appears that
the favor which God had vouchsafed unto them was gratuitous, and not founded
upon their merits. We also require to be treated by Him with the same
indulgence, seeing that we should utterly fall away, if God did not pardon our
sins. The sons of Jacob have, indeed, a just cause of offense, because not only
are they affected with their own private ignominy, but they are tormented with
the indignity of the crime, because their sister had been dragged forth from the
house of Jacob, as from a sanctuary, to be violated. For this they chiefly urge,
that it would have been wickedness to allow such disgrace in the elect and holy
people: 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F572</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but they themselves, through the hatred of one sin, rush furiously forward to
greater and more intolerable crimes. Therefore we must beware, lest, after we
have become severe judges in condemning the faults of others, we hasten
inconsiderately into evil. But chiefly we must abstain from violent remedies
which surpass the evil we desire to
correct.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which thing ought not
to be done</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F573</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Interpreters commonly explain the passage as meaning, "it is not becoming that
such a thing should be done;" but, in my judgment, it applies more properly to
the sons of Jacob, who had determined with themselves that the injury was not to
be borne. Yet they wrongfully appropriate to themselves the right of taking
revenge: why do they not rather reflect thus; "God, who has received us under
his care and protection, will not suffer this injury to pass unavenged; in the
meantime, it is our part to be silent, and to leave the act of punishing, which
is not placed in our hands, entirely to his sovereign will." Hence we may learn,
when we are angry at the sins of other men, not to attempt anything which is
beyond our own duty.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Hamor communed with
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Though the sons of Jacob were justly
incensed, yet their indignation ought to have been appeased, or at least
somewhat mitigated, by the great courteousness of Hamor. And if the humanity of
Hamor could not reconcile the sons of Jacob to Shechem, the old man himself was
indeed worthy of a benignant reception. We see what equitable conditions he
offers; he himself was the prince of the city, the sons of Jacob were strangers.
Therefore their minds must have been savage beyond measure, not to be inclined
to levity. Besides, the suppliant entreaty of Shechem himself deserved this,
that they should have granted forgiveness to his fervent love. Therefore, that
they remained implacable, is a sign of most cruel pride. What would they have
done to enemies who had purposely injured them, when they are not moved by the
prayers of him, who, being deceived by blind love, and by the error of
incontinence, has injured them without any malicious
intention?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the sons of Jacob
answered</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The commencement of their perfidious
course is here related: for they, being outrageous rather than simply angry,
wish to overthrow the whole city, and not being sufficiently strong to contend
against so great a number of people, they contrive a new fraud, in order that
they may suddenly rise upon the inhabitants weakened by wounds. Therefore, since
the Shechemites had no strength to resist, it became a cruel butchery rather
than a conquest, which increased the atrocity of wickedness in Jacob's sons, who
cared for nothing so that they might but gratify their rage. They allege in
excuse, that, whereas they were separated from other nations, it was not lawful
for them to give wives of their own family to the uncircumcised. Which indeed
was true if they said it sincerely; but they falsely use the sacred name of God
as a pretext; yea, their double profanation of that name proves them to be
doubly sacrilegious; for they cared nothing about circumcision, but were intent
on this one thing, how they might crush the miserable men in a state of
weakness. Besides, they wickedly sever the sign from the truth which it
represents; as if any one, by laying aside his uncircumcision, might suddenly
pass over into the Church of God. And in this mode they pollute the spiritual
symbol of life, by admitting foreigners, promiscuously and without
discrimination, into its society. But since their pretense has some color of
probability, we must observe what they say, that it would be disgraceful to them
to give their sister to a man uncircumcised. This also is true, if they who used
the words were sincere; for since they bore the mark of God in their flesh, it
was wicked in them to contract marriages with unbelievers. So also, at the
present time, our baptism separates us from the profane, so that whoever mixes
himself with them, fixes a mark of infamy upon
himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And their words pleased
Hamor</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses prosecutes the history until he
comes to the slaughter of the Shechemites. Hamor had, no doubt, been induced by
the entreaties of his son, to show himself thus tractable. Whence appears the
excessive indulgence of the kind old man. He ought, in the beginning, severely
to have corrected the fault of his son; but he not only covers it as much as
possible, but yields to all his wishes. This moderation and equity would have
been commendable, if what his son had required was just; but that the old man,
for the sake of his son, should adopt a new religion, and suffer a wound to be
inflicted on his own flesh, cannot be deemed free from folly. The youth is said
not to have delayed, because he vehemently loved the maid, and excelled in
dignity among his own citizens; and on account of the honor of his rank he
easily obtained what he wished: for the fervor of his love would have availed
nothing, unless he had possessed the power of accomplishing his
object.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These men are
peaceable</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses describes the mode of acting,
whereby they persuaded the Shechemites to accept the conditions which the sons
of Jacob had imposed. It was difficult to induce a whole people to submit in an
affair of such magnitude to a few foreigners. For we know what displeasure a
change of religion produces: but Hamor and Shechem reason from utility; and this
is natural rhetoric. For although honor has a more plausible appearance, it is
yet for the most part cold in persuasion. But among the vulgar, utility carries
almost every point; because the major part eagerly pursues what it deems
expedient for itself. With this design, Hamor and Shechem extol the family of
Jacob for their honesty and tranquil habits, in order that the Shechemites may
deem it useful to themselves to receive such guests. They add that the land is
sufficiently large, so that no loss is to be feared on the part of the original
inhabitants. They then enumerate other advantages; meanwhile, they cunningly
conceal the private and real cause of their request. Whence it follows that all
these pretexts were fallacious. But it is a very common disease, that men of
rank who have great authority, while making all things subservient to their own
private ends, feign themselves to be considerate for the common good, and
pretend to a desire for the public advantage. And, truly, it may be believed,
that the persons here spoken of were the best among all the people, and were
endowed with singular superiority; for the Shechemites had chosen Hamor for
their prince, as one who was preeminent in excellent gifts. Yet we see how he
and his son lie and deceive, under the appearance of rectitude. Whence also we
perceive hypocrisy to be so deeply rooted in human minds, that it is a miracle
to find any one entirely free from it; especially where private advantage is
concerned. From this example let all who govern, learn to cultivate sincerity in
public designs, without any sinister regard to their own interests. On the other
hand; let the people exercise self-government, lest they too earnestly seek
their own advantage; because it will often happen that they are caught by a
specious appearance of good, as fishes by the hook. For as self-love is blind,
we are drawn without judgment to the hope of gain. And the Lord also justly
chastises this cupidity, to which he sees us to be unduly prone, when he suffers
us to be deceived by it. Moses says that this discourse took place in the gate
of the city, where public assemblies were then wont to be held and judgment
administered.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b><i>And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened,
etc</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Apparently this consent may be ascribed to
modesty and humanity; for, by readily obeying their princes, and kindly
admitting the strangers to an equality of rights in the city, they show
themselves, in both respects, modest and humane. But if we reflect on the true
import of circumcision, it will easily appear that they were too much addicted
to their own selfish interests. They knew that, by a new sacrament, they would
be committed to a different worship of God. They had not yet been taught that
the ablutions and sacrifices, to which they had been all their life accustomed,
were unprofitable trifles. Therefore, to change their religion so carelessly
betrays, on their part, a gross contempt of God; for never do they who seriously
worship God, so suddenly cast aside their superstitions, unless they are
convinced by sound doctrine and arguments. But the Shechemites, blinded by an
evil conscience, and by the hope of gain, pass over, like men half brutalized,
to an unknown God. Search the isles, (saith the Prophet,) is there any nation
which deserts its, gods, who yet are not gods? 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F574</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Yet this was done at Shechem, when no defect had been shown to exist in the
received superstitions; wherefore none ought to wonder that a sad result
followed this levity of mind. nevertheless, Simian and Levi were not, on that
account, excusable for the indulgence of their own cruelty: yea, their impiety
appears the more detestable, because they not only rush impetuously upon men,
but, in a sense, trample upon the sacred covenant of God, of which alone they
make their boast. Certainly, if they had no feeling for the men themselves, yet
reverence for God ought to have restrained their ferocity, when they reflected
from what cause the weakness of the Shechemites
proceeded.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Simian and Levi, Dinah's
brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Because Moses says that the slaughter
took place on the third day, the Hebrews think that, at that time, the pain of
the wound was most severe. The proof, however, is not valid; nor is it of much
moment. Although Moses names only two authors of the slaughter, it does not
appear to me probable that they came alone, but that they were the leaders of
the troop: for Jacob had a large family, and it might be that they called some
of their brothers to join them; yet, because the affair was conducted by their
counsel and direction, it is ascribed to them, as Cartage is said to have been
destroyed by Scipio. Moses also calls them the brothers of Dinah, because they
were by the same mother. We have seen that Dinah was the daughter of Leah; for
which reason Simon and Levi, whose own sister she was by both parents, were the
more enraged at the violation of her chastity: they were therefore impelled, not
so much by the common reproach brought upon the holy and elect race, (according
to their recent boast,) as by a sense of the infamy brought upon themselves.
However, there is no reader who does not readily perceive how dreadful and
execrable was this crime. One man only had sinned, and he endeavored to
compensate for the injury, by many acts of kindness; but the cruelty of Simon
and Levi could only be satiated by the destruction of the whole city; and, under
the pretext of a covenant, they form a design against friends and hospitable
persons, in a time of peace, which would have been deemed intolerable against
enemies in open war. Hence we perceive how mercifully God dealt with that
people; seeing that, from the posterity of a sanguinary man, and even of a
wicked robber, he raised up a priesthood for himself. Let the Jews now go and be
proud of their noble origin. But the Lord declared his gratuitous mercy by too
many proofs for the ingratitude of man to be able to obscure it. Moreover, we
hence learn that Moses did not speak from carnal sense; but was the instrument
of the Holy Spirit, and the herald of the celestial Judge; for though he was a
Levite, he yet is so far from sparing his own race, that he does not hesitate to
brand the father of his tribe with perpetual infamy. And it is not to be doubted
that the Lord purposely intended to stop the mouths of impure and profane men,
such as the Lucianists, who confess that Moses was a very great man, and of rare
excellence; but that he procured for himself, by craft and subtlety, authority
over a great people, as if, indeed, an acute and intelligent man would not have
known that, by this single act of wickedness, the honor of his race would be
greatly tarnished. He had, however, no other design than to extol the goodness
of God towards his people; and truly there was nothing which he less desired
than to exercise dominion, as appears clearly from the fact, that he transferred
the office of priesthood to another family, and commanded his sons to be only
ministers. With respect to the Shechemites, although in the sight of God they
were not innocent; seeing they preferred their own advantage to a religion which
they thought lawful, yet it was not the Lord's will that they should be so
grievously punished for their fault; but he suffered this signal punishment to
follow the violation of one maid, that he might testify to all ages his great
abhorrence of lust. Besides, seeing that the iniquity had arisen from a prince
of the city, the punishment is rightly extended to the whole body of the people:
for since God never commits the government to evil and vicious princes, except
in righteous judgment, there is no wonder that, when they sin, they involve
their subjects with them in the same condemnation. Moreover, from this example
let us learn, that if, at any time, fornication prevail with impunity, God will,
at length, exact punishments so much the more severe: for if the violation of
one maid was avenged by the horrible massacre of a whole city; he will not sleep
nor be quiet, if a whole people indulge in a common license of fornication, and,
on all sides, connive at each other's iniquity. The sons of Jacob acted indeed
wickedly; but we must observe that fornication was, in this manner, divinely
condemned.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The sons of Jacob
came</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses shows that, not content with simple
revenge, they fly together to the spoil. As it respects the words, they are said
to have come upon the slain, either because they made themselves a way over the
slaughtered bodies; or because, in addition to the slaughter, they rushed to the
plunder. In whichever way it is taken, Moses teaches that, not satisfied with
their former wickedness, they made this addition to it. Be it, that they were
blinded with anger in shedding blood; yet by what right do they sack the city?
This certainly cannot be ascribed to anger. But these are the ordinary fruits of
human intemperance, that he who gives himself the rein in perpetrating one
wickedness, soon breaks out into another. Thus the sons of Jacob, from being
murderers, become also robbers, and the guilt of avarice is added to that of
cruelty. The more anxious then should be our endeavors to bridle our desires;
lest they should mutually fan each other, so that at length, by their combined
action, a dreadful conflagration should arise; but especially, we must beware of
using force of arms, which brings with it many perverse and brutal assaults.
Moses says that the sons of Jacob did this, because the Shechemites had defiled
their sister; but the whole city was not guilty. Moses, however, only states in
what way the authors of the slaughter are affected: for although they wish to
appear just avengers of the injury, yet they pay no respect to what it was
lawful for them to do, and make no attempt to control their depraved affections,
and consequently set no bounds to their wickedness. Should any one prefer taking
the expression in a higher sense, it may be referred to the judgment of God, by
which the whole city was involved in guilt, because no one had opposed the lust
of the prince: perhaps many had consented to it, as not being very much
concerned about the unjust dishonor done to their guests; but the former sense
is what I most approve.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob
said</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses declares that the crime was
condemned by the holy man, lest any one should think that he had participated in
their counsel. He also expostulates with his sons, because they had caused him
to stink among the inhabitants of the land; that is, they had rendered him so
odious, that no one would be able to bear him. If then the neighboring nations
should conspire among themselves, he would be unable to resist them, seeing he
had so small a band, in comparison with their great number. He also expressly
names the Canaanites and Perizzites, who, though they had received no wrong,
were yet by nature exceedingly prone to inflict injury. But Jacob may seem to
act preposterously, in overlooking the offense committed against God, and in
considering only his own danger. Why is he not rather angry at their cruelty?
why is he not offended at their perfidy? why does he not reprove their
rapaciousness? It is however probable, that when he saw them terror &#8212;
stricken at their recent crime, he suited miswords to their state of mind. For
he acts as if he were complaining that he, rather than the Shechemites, was
slain by them. We know that men are seldom if ever drawn to repentance, except
by the fear of punishment: especially when they have any specious pretext as a
covering for their fault. Besides, we know not whether Moses may not have
selected this as a part out of a long expostulation, to cause his readers to
understand that the fury of Simon and Levi was so outrageous, that they were
more insensible than brute beasts to their own destruction and that of their
whole family. This is clear from their own answer, which not only breathes a
barbarous ferocity, but shows that they had no feeling. It was barbarous, first,
because they excuse themselves for having destroyed a whole people and plundered
their city, on account of the injury done by one man; secondly, because they
answer their father so shortly and contumaciously; thirdly, because they
obstinately defend the revenge which they had rashly taken. Moreover, their
insensibility was prodigious, because they were not affected by the thought of
their own death, and that of their parents, wives, and children, which seemed
just at hand. Thus we are taught, how intemperate anger deprives men of their
senses. We are also admonished, that it is not enough for us to be able to lay
blame on our opponents; but we must always see how far it is lawful for us to
proceed.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And God said unto
Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses relates that when Jacob had been
reduced to the last extremity, God came to his help in the right time, and as at
the critical juncture. And thus he shows, in the person of one man, that God
never deserts his Church which he has once embraced, but will procure its
salvation. We must, however, observe the order of his procedure; for God did not
immediately appear to his servant, but suffered him first to be tormented by
grief and excessive cares, that he might learn patience, deferring his
consolation to the time of extreme necessity. Certainly the condition of Jacob
was then most miserable. For all, on every side, might be so incensed against
him that he would be surrounded with as many deaths as there were neighboring
nations: and he was not so stupid as to be insensible of his danger. God
suffered the holy man to be thus tossed with cares and tormented with troubles,
until, by a kind of resurrection, he restored him, as one half-dead. Whenever we
read this and similar passages, let us reflect that the providence of God
watches for our salvation, even when it most seems to sleep. Moses does not say
how long Jacob was kept in anxiety, but we may infer from the context, that he
had been very greatly perplexed, when the Lord thus revived him. Moreover, we
must observe that the principal medicine by which he was restored, was contained
in the expression, The Lord spoke. Why did not God by a miracle translate him to
some other place, and thus immediately remove him from all danger? Why did he
not even, without a word, stretch out the hand over him, and repress the
ferocity of all, so that no one should attempt to hurt him? But Moses does not
insist upon this point in vain. For hereby we are taught whence our greatest
consolation in our afflictions is to be sought; and also, that it is the
principal business of our life, to depend upon the word of God, as those who are
certainly persuaded that, when he has promised salvation, he will deal well with
us, so that we need not hesitate to walk through the midst of deaths. Another
reason for the vision was, that Jacob might not only truly perceive that God was
his deliverer; but, being forewarned by his word, might learn to ascribe to God
whatever afterwards followed. For seeing that we are slow and dull, bare
experience by no means suffices to attest the favor of God towards us, unless
faith arising from the word be
added.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go up to
Beth-el</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Though it is God's design to raise his
servant from death to life, he may yet have appeared to hold him up to derision;
for the objection was ready, Thou indeed, O Lord, commandest me to go up, but
all the ways are closed; for my sons have raised such a flame against me, that I
cannot remain safe in any hiding-place. I dare scarcely move a finger: what
therefore will become of me, if with a great multitude, I now begin to move my
camp? shall I not provoke new enmities against me by my movements? But by this
mode the faith of Jacob was most fully proved; because, knowing God to be the
leader and guardian of his journey, he girded himself to it, relying on the
divine favor. Moreover, the Lord does not simply command what it is his will to
have done, but he encourages his servant, by adding the promise. For, in
reminding him that he is the same God who had before appeared unto him as he was
fleeing in alarm from his brother, a promise is included in these words. The
altar also refers to the same point; for since it is the divinely appointed
token of thanksgiving, it follows that Jacob would come thither in safety, in
order that he might duly celebrate the grace of God. God chooses and assigns
Bethel, rather than any other place, for his sanctuary; because the very sight
of it would greatly avail to take away terror, when he should remember that
there the glory of the Lord had been seen by him. Further, since God exhorts his
servant to gratitude, he shows that he is kind to the faithful, in order that
they, in return, may own themselves to be indebted for everything to his grace,
and may exercise themselves in the celebration of
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then Jacob said unto his
household</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The prompt obedience of Jacob is
here described. For when he heard the voice of God, he neither doubted nor
disputed with himself respecting what was necessary to be done: but, as he was
commanded, he quickly prepared himself for his journey. But to show that he
obeyed God, he not only collected his goods, but also purified his house from
idols. For if we desire that God should be propitious to us, all hindrances are
to be removed, which in any way separate him from us. Hence also we perceive to
what point the theft of Rachel tended. For, (as we have said,) she neither
wished to draw her father away from superstition, but rather followed him in his
fault; nor did she keep this poison to herself, but spread it through the whole
family. Thus was that sacred house infected with the worst contagion. Whence
also it appears, how great is the propensity of mankind to impious and vicious
worship; since the domestics of Jacob, to whom the pure religion had been handed
down, thus eagerly laid hold on the idols offered to them. And Jacob was not
entirely ignorant of the evil: but it is probable that he was so far under the
influence of his wife, that, by connivance, he silently cherished this plague of
his family. And truly, in one word, he convicts and condemns both himself and
the rest, by calling idols "strange gods." For whence arose the distinction here
made, unless from his knowing that he ought to be devoted to one God only? For
there is a tacit comparison between the God of Abraham and all other gods which
the world had wickedly invented for itself: not because it was in the power of
Abraham to determine who should be the true God: but because God had manifested
himself to Abraham, he also wished to assume His name. Jacob therefore confesses
his own negligence, in having admitted to his house idols, against which the
door had been closed by God. For wherever the knowledge of the true God shines,
it is necessary to drive far away whatever men fabricate to themselves which is
contrary to the true knowledge of him. But whereas Jacob had been lulled to
sleep either by the blandishments of his wife, or had neglected to do his duty,
through the carelessness of the flesh, he is now aroused by the fear of danger,
to become more earnest in the pure worship of God. If this happened to the holy
patriarch, how much more ought carnal security to be dreaded by us, in the
season of prosperity? If, however, at any time such torpor and neglect shall
have stolen upon us, may the paternal chastisement of God excite and stimulate
us diligently to purge ourselves from whatever faults we, by our negligence, may
have contracted. The infinite goodness of God is here conspicuous; seeing that
he still deigned to regard the house of Jacob, though polluted with idols, as
his sanctuary. For although Jacob mingled with idolaters, and even his wife,
&#8212; a patroness of idolatry, &#8212; slept in his bosom, his sacrifices were
always acceptable to God. Yet this great benignity of God in granting pardon,
neither lessens the fault of the holy man, nor ought to be used by us as an
occasion for negligence. For though Jacob did not approve of these
superstitions, yet it was not owing to him that the pure worship of God was not
gradually subverted. For the corruption which originated with Rachel was now
beginning to spread more widely. And the example of all ages teaches the same
thing. For scarcely ever does the truth of God so prevail among men, however
strenuously pious teachers may labor in maintaining it, but that some
superstitions will remain among the common people. If dissimulation be added to
them, the mischief soon creeps onward, until it takes possession of the whole
body. By being thus cherished, the mass of superstitions which at this day
pervades the Papacy, has gained its influence. Wherefore we must boldly resist
those beginnings of evil, lest the true religion should be injured by the sloth
and silence of the
pastors.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And be clean, and
change your garments</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is an exhortation to
the external profession of penitence. For Jacob wishes that his domestics, who
before had polluted themselves, should testify their renewed purification by a
change of garments. With the same design and end, the people, after they had
made the golden calves, were commanded by Moses to put off their ornaments. Only
in that instance a different method was observed; namely, that the people having
laid aside their ornaments, simply confessed their guilt by mournful and mean
apparel: but in the house of Jacob the garments were changed, in order that they
who had been defiled might come forth as new men: yet the end (as I have said)
was the same, that by this external rite, idolaters might learn how great was
the atrocity of their wickedness. For although, repentance is an inward virtue,
and has its seat in the heart, yet this ceremony was by no means superfluous;
for we know how little disposed men are to be displeased with themselves on
account of their sins, unless they are pierced with many goads. Again, the glory
of God is also concerned in this, that men should not only inwardly reflect upon
their guilt, but at the same time openly declare it. This then is the sum;
although God had given no express command concerning the purifying of his house,
yet because he had commanded an altar to be raised, Jacob, in order that he
might yield pure obedience to God, took care that all impediments should be
removed; and he did this when necessity compelled him to seek help from
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they gave unto
Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Though the holy man had his house in
suitable subordination; yet as all yielded such prompt obedience to his command
by casting away their idols, I doubt not that they were influenced by the fear
of danger. Whence also we infer how important it is for us to be aroused from
slumber by suffering. For we know how pertinacious and rebellious is
superstition. If, in a peaceful and joyous state of affairs, Jacob had given any
such command, the greater part of his family would have fraudulently concealed
their idols: some, perhaps, would have obstinately refused to surrender them;
but now the hand of God urges them, and with ready minds they quickly repent. It
is also probable, that, according to the circumstances of the time, Jacob
preached to them concerning the righteous judgment of God, to inspire them with
fear. When he commands them to cleanse themselves, it is as if he had said,
Hitherto ye have been defiled before the Lord; now, seeing that he has regarded
us so mercifully, wash out this filth, lest he should again avert his face from
us. It seems, however, absurd, that Jacob should have buried the idols under an
oak, and not rather have broken them in pieces and consumed them in the fire, as
we read that Moses did with the golden calves,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;023220&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
32:20,) and Hezekiah with the brazen serpent,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;121804&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 18:4.) The fact is not thus related without reason: but the infirmity of
Jacob is touched upon, because he had not been sufficiently provident against
the future. And perhaps the Lord punished his previous excessive connivance and
want of firmness, by depriving him of prudence or courage. Yet God accepted his
obedience, although it had some remainder of defect, knowing that it was the
design of the holy man to remove idols from his family, and, in token of his
detestation, to bury them in the earth. The earrings were doubtless badges of
superstition; as at this day innumerable trifles are seen in the Papacy, by
which impiety displays itself.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the terror of God was upon
the cities</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It now manifestly appears that
deliverance was not in vain promised to the holy man by God; since, amidst so
many hostile swords, he goes forth not only in safety but undisturbed. By the
destruction of the Shechemites all the neighboring people were inflamed with
enmity against a single family; yet no one moves to take vengeance. The reason
is explained by Moses, that the terror of God had fallen upon them, which
repressed their violent assaults. Hence we may learn that the hearts of men are
in the hands of God; that he can inspire those with fortitude who in themselves
are weak; and, on the other hand, soften their iron-hardness whenever he
pleases. Sometimes, indeed, he suffers many to cast up the foam of their pride,
against whom he afterwards opposes his power: but he often weakens those with
fear who were naturally bold as lions: thus we find these giants, who were able
to devour Jacob a hundred times, so struck with terror that they faint away.
Wherefore, whenever we see the wicked furiously bent on our destruction, lest
our hearts should fail with fear and be broken by desperation, let us call to
mind this terror of God, by which the rage, however furious, of the whole world
may be easily subdued.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he built there an
altar</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It has been already stated why it
behaved the holy fathers, wherever they came, to have an altar of their own,
distinct from those of other nations; namely, to make it manifest that they did
not worship gods of various kinds, a practice to which the world was then
everywhere addicted, but that they had a God peculiar to themselves. For
although God is worshipped with the mind, yet an external confession is the
inseparable companion of faith. Besides, all acknowledge how very useful it is
to us to be stirred up by outward helps to the worship of God. If any one object
that these altars differed nothing from other altars in appearance; I answer,
that whereas others rashly, and with inconsiderate zeal, built altars to unknown
gods, Jacob always adhered to the word of God. And there is no lawful altar but
that which is consecrated by the word; nor indeed did the worship of Jacob excel
by any other mark than this, that he attempted nothing beyond the command of
God. In calling the name of the place "The God of Beth-el," 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F575</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he is thought to be too familiar; and yet this very title commends the faith of
the holy man, and that rightly, since he confines himself within the divinely
prescribed bounds. The Papists act foolishly in affecting the praise of humility
by a modesty which is most degrading. But the humility of faith is praiseworthy,
seeing it does not desire to know more than God permits. And as when God
descends to us, he, in a certain sense, abases himself, and stammers with us, so
he allows us to stammer with him. And this is to be truly wise, when we embrace
God in the manner in which he accommodates himself to our capacity. For in this
way, Jacob does not keenly dispute concerning the essence of God, but renders
God familiar to himself by the oracle which he has received. And because he
applies his senses to the revelation, this stammering and simplicity (as I have
said) is acceptable to God. Now, though at this day, the knowledge of God has
shined more clearly, yet since God, in the gospel, takes upon him the character
of a nursing father, let us learn to subject our minds to him; only let us
remember that he descends to us in order to raise us up to himself. For he does
not speak to us in this earthly manner, to keep us at a distance from heaven,
but rather by this vehicle, to draw us up thither. Meanwhile this rule must be
observed, that since the name of the altar was given by a celestial oracle, the
building of it was a proof of faith. For where the living voice of God does not
sound, whatever pomps may be introduced will be like shadowy spectres; as in the
Papacy nothing can be seen except bladders filled with wind. It may be added
that Jacob shows the constant tenor of his faith, from the time that God began
to manifest himself to him; because he keeps in view the fact, that the angels
had appeared unto him. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F576</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For since the word is in the plural number, I willingly interpret it of angels;
and this is not contrary to the former doctrine; for although the majesty of God
was then conspicuous, so far as he could comprehend it, yet Moses does not
without reason mention the angels whom Jacob saw ascending and descending on the
steps of the ladder. For he then beheld the glory of God in the angels, as we
see the splendor of the sun flowing to us through his
rays.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But Deborah, Rebecca's nurse,
died</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here is inserted a short narration of the
death of Deborah, whom we may conclude to have been a holy matron, and whom the
family of Jacob venerated as a mother; for the name given in perpetuity to the
place, testifies that she was buried with peculiar honor, and with no common
mourning. Shortly afterwards the death and burial of Rachel are to be recorded:
yet Moses does not say that any sign of mourning for Deborah was transmitted to
posterity; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F577</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
therefore it is probable that she was held by all in the place of a grandmother:
But it may be asked, how she then happened to be in Jacob's company, seeing that
he had not yet come to his father; and the age of a decrepit old woman rendered
her unfit for so long a journey. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F578</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Some interpreters imagine that she had been sent by Rebecca to meet her son
Jacob; but I do not see what probability there is in the conjecture; nor yet
have I anything certain to affirm, except that, perhaps, she had loved Jacob
from a boy, because she had nursed him; and when she knew the cause of his
exile, she followed him from her regard for religion. Certainly Moses does not
in vain celebrate her death with an eulogy so
remarkable.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And God appeared unto
Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses, having introduced a few words on
the death of Deborah, recites a second vision, by which Jacob was confirmed,
after his return to Bethel. Once, in this place, God had appeared unto him, when
he was on his way into Mesopotamia. In the meantime God had testified in various
methods, as need required, that he would be present with him everywhere through
his whole journey; but now he is brought back again to that very place where a
more illustrious and memorable oracle had been given him, in order that he may
receive again a new confirmation of his faith. The blessing of God here means
nothing else than his promise; for though men pray for blessings on each other;
God declares himself to be the sole Dispenser of perfect happiness. Now Jacob
heard at this time nothing new; but the same promise is repeated to him, that
he, as one who had returned from captivity to his own country, and had gathered
new strength to his faith, might accomplish with greater courage the remaining
course of his life.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy name shall not be called
any more Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We have before given the
meaning of these words. The former name is not abolished, but the dignity of the
other, which was afterwards put upon him, is preferred: for he was called Jacob
from the womb, because he had strongly wrestled with his brother; but he was
afterwards called Israel, because he entered into contest with God, and obtained
the victory; not that he had prevailed by his own power, (for he had borrowed
courage and strength and arms from God alone,) but because it was the Lord's
will freely to confer upon him this honor. He therefore speaks comparatively,
showing that the name Jacob is obscure and ignoble when compared with the name
Israel. Some understand it thus, "Not only shalt thou be called Jacob, but the
surname of Israel shall be added;" yet the former exposition seems to me the
more simple; namely, that the old name, having in it less of splendor, should
give place to the second. What Augustine adduces is specious rather than solid;
namely, that he was called Jacob in reference to his present life, but Israel in
reference to his future life. Let this, however, be regarded as settled, that a
double name was given to the holy man, of which one was by far the most
excellent; for we see that the prophets often combine them both, thus marking
the constancy of God's grace from the beginning to the
end.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am God
Almighty</i></font><font face="Palatino">. God here, as elsewhere, proclaims his
own might, in order that Jacob may the more certainly rely on his faithfulness.
He then promises that he will cause Jacob to increase and multiply, not only
into one nation, but into a multitude of nations. When he speaks of "a nation,"
he no doubt means that the offspring of Jacob should become sufficiently
numerous to acquire the body and the name of one great people. But that follows
concerning "nations" may appear absurd; for if we wish it to refer to the
nations which, by gratuitous adoption, are inserted into the race of Abraham,
the form of expression is improper: but if it be understood of sons by naturals
descent, then it would be a curse rather shall a blessing, that the Church, the
safety of which depends on its unity, should be divided into many distinct
nations. But to me it appears that the Lord, in these words, comprehended both
these benefits; for when, under Joshua, the people was apportioned into tribes,
as if the seed of Abraham was propagated into so many distinct nations; yet the
body was not thereby divided; it is called an assembly of nations, for this
reason, because in connection with that distinction a sacred unity yet
flourished. The language also is not improperly extended to the Gentiles, who,
having been before dispersed, are collected into one congregation by the bond of
faith; and although they were not born of Jacob according to the flesh; yet,
because faith was to them the commencement of a new birth, and the covenant of
salvation, which is the seed of spiritual birth, flowed from Jacob, all
believers are rightly reckoned among his sons, according to the declaration, I
have constituted thee a father of many
nations.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And kings shall come
out of thy loins</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This, in my judgment, ought
properly to be referred to David and his posterity; for God did not approve of
the kingdom of Saul, and therefore it was not established; and the kingdom of
Israel was but a corruption of the legitimate kingdom. I acknowledge truly that,
sometimes, those things which have sprung from evil sources are numbered among
God's benefits; but because here the simple and pure benediction of God is
spoken of, I willingly understand it of David's successors only. Finally; Jacob
is constituted the lord of the land, as the sole heir of his grandfather
Abraham, and of his father Isaac; for the Lord manifestly excludes Esau from the
holy family, when he transfers the dominion of the land, by hereditary right, to
the posterity of Jacob alone.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And God went up from
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This ascent of God is analogous to his
descent; for God, who fills heaven and earth, is yet said to descend to us,
though he changes not his place, whenever he gives us any token of his presence;
a mode of expression adopted in accommodation to our littleness. He went up,
therefore, from Jacob, when he disappeared from his sight, or when the vision
ended. By the use of such language, God shows us the value of his word, because,
indeed, he is near to us in the testimony of his grace; for, seeing that there
is a great distance between us and his heavenly glory, he descends to us by his
word. This, at length, was fully accomplished in the person of Christ; who
while, by his own ascension to heaven, he raised our faith thither; nevertheless
dwells always with us by the power of his
Spirit.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob set up a
pillar</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Though it is possible that he may again
have erected a sacred monument, in memory of the second vision; yet I readily
subscribe to the opinion of those who think that reference is made to what had
been done before; as if Moses should say, that was the ancient temple of God, in
which Jacob had poured forth his libation: for he had not been commanded to come
thither for the sake of dwelling there; but in order that a fresh view of the
place might renew his faith in the ancient oracle, and more fully confirm it. We
read elsewhere that altars were built by the holy fathers, where they intended
to remain longer; but their reason for doing so was different: for whereas Jacob
had made a solemn vow in Beth-el, on condition that he should be brought back by
the Lord in safety; thanksgiving is now required of him, after he has become
bound by his vow, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F579</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that, being strengthened, he may pass onward on his
journey.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they journeyed from
Beth-el</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We have seen how severe a wound the
defilement of his daughter inflicted on holy Jacob, and with what terror the
cruel deed of his two sons had inspired him. Various trials are now blended
together, by which he is heavily afflicted throughout his old age; until, on his
departure into Egypt, he receives new joy at the sight of his son Joseph. But
even this was a most grievous temptation, to be exiled from the promised land
even to his death. The death of his beloved wife is next related; and soon after
follows the incestuous intercourse of his firstborn with his wife Bilhah. A
little later, Isaac his father dies; then his son Joseph is snatched away, whom
he supposes to have been torn in pieces by wild beasts. While he is almost
consumed with perpetual mourning, a famine arises, so that he is compelled to
seek food from Egypt. There another of his sons is kept in chains; and, at
length, he is deprived of his own most beloved Benjamin, whom he sends away as
if his own bowels were torn from him. We see, therefore, by what a severe
conflict, and by what a continued succession of evils, he was trained to the
hope of a better life. And whereas Rachel died in childbirth, through the
fatigue of the journey, before they reached a resting-place; this would prove no
small accession to his grief. But, as to his being bereaved of his most beloved
wife, this was probably the cause, that the Lord intended to correct the
exorbitance of his affection for her. The Holy Spirit fixes no mark of infamy
upon Leah, seeing that she was a holy woman, and endowed with greater virtue;
but Jacob more highly appreciated Rachel's beauty. This fault in the holy man
was cured by a bitter medicine, when his wife was taken array from him: and the
Lord often deprives the faithful of his own gifts, to correct their perverse
abuse of them. The wicked, indeed, more audaciously profane the gifts of God;
but if God connives longer at their misconduct, a more severe condemnation
remains to them on account of his forbearance. But in taking away from his own
people the occasion of sinning, he promotes their salvation. Whoever, therefore,
desires the continued use of God's gifts, let him learn not to abuse them, but
to enjoy them with purity and sobriety.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The midwife said unto
her</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We know that the ancients were very
desirous of offspring, especially of male offspring. Since Rachel therefore does
not accept this kind of consolation when offered, we infer that she was
completely oppressed with pain. She therefore died in agonies, thinking of
nothing but her sad childbirth and her own sorrows: from the feeling of which
she gave a name to her son; but Jacob afterwards corrected the error. For the
chance of the name sufficiently shows, that, in his judgment, the excess of
sorrow in his wife was wrong; seeing that she had branded his son with a
sinister and opprobrious name; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F580</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for that sadness is not free from ingratitude, which so occupies our minds in
adversity that the kindness of God does not exhilarate them; or, at least, does
not infuse some portion of sweetness to mitigate our grief. Then her burial is
mentioned; to which the holy fathers could not have attended with such religious
care, except on account of their hope of the future resurrection. Whenever,
therefore, we read concerning their burying the dead, as if they were anxious
about the performance of some extraordinary duty, let us think of that end of
which I have spoken; for it was no foolish ceremony, but a lively symbol of the
future resurrection. I acknowledge, indeed, that profane and degenerate men at
that time, in various places, vainly incurred much expense and toil in burying
their dead, only as an empty solace of their grief. But although they had
declined from the original institution into gross errors, yet the Lord caused
that this rite should remain entire among his own people. Moreover, he designed
that a testimony should exist among unbelievers, by which they might be rendered
inexcusable. For since, independently of instruction, this sentiment was innate
in all men, that to bury the dead was one of the offices of piety, nature has
clearly dictated to them that the human body is formed for immortality; and,
therefore, that, by sinking into death, it does not utterly perish. The statue
or monument, erected by him, signifies the same thing. He reared no citadel
which might stand as a token of his glory among his posterity: but he took care
to raise the memorial of a sepulcher, which might be a witness to all ages that
he was more devoted to the life to come; and, by the providence of God, this
memorial remained standing, till the people returned out of
Egypt.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Reuben went and lay with
Bilhah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. A sad and even tragic history is now
related concerning the incestuous intercourse of Reuben with his mother-in-law.
Moses, indeed, calls Bilhah Jacob's concubine: but though she had not come into
the hands of her husband, as the mistress of the family and a partaker of his
goods; yet, as it respected the bed, she was his lawful wife, as we have before
seen. If even a stranger had defiled the wife of the holy man, it would have
been a great disgrace; it was, however, far more atrocious that he should suffer
such an indignity from his own son. But how great and how detestable was the
dishonor, that the mother of two tribes should not only contaminate herself with
adultery, but even with incest; which crime is so abhorrent to nature, that, not
even among the Gentiles, has it ever been held tolerable? And truly, by the
wonderful artifice of Satan, this great obscenity penetrated into the holy
house, in order that the election of God might seem to be of no effect. Satan
endeavors, by whatever means he can, to pervert the grace of God in the elect;
and since he cannot effect that, he either covers it with infamy, or at least
obscures it. Hence it happens that disgraceful examples often steal into the
Church. And the Lord, in this manner, suffers his own people to be humbled, that
they may be more attentively careful of themselves, that they may more earnestly
watch unto prayer, and may learn entirely to depend on his mercy. Moses only
relates that Jacob was informed of this crime; but he conceals his grief, not
because he was unfeeling, (for he was not so stupid as to be insensible to
sorrow,) but because his grief was too great to be expressed. For here Moses
seems to have acted as the painter did who, in representing the sacrifice of
Iphigenia, put a veil over her father's face, because he could not sufficiently
express the grief of his countenance. In addition to this eternal disgrace of
the family, there were other causes of anxiety which transfixed the breast of
the holy man. The sum of his happiness was in his offspring, from which the
salvation of the whole world was to proceed. Whereas, already, two of his sons
had been perfidious and sanguinary robbers; the first-born, now, exceeds them
both in wickedness. But here the gratuitous election of God has appeared the
more illustrious, because it was not on account of their worthiness that he
preferred the sons of Jacob to all the world; and also because, when they had
fallen so basely, this election nevertheless remained firm and efficacious.
Warned by such examples, let us learn to fortify ourselves against those
dreadful scandals by which Satan strives to disturb us. Let every one also
privately apply this to the strengthening of his own faith. For sometimes even
good men slide, as if they had fallen from grace. Desperation would necessarily
be the consequence of such ruin, unless the Lord, on the other hand, held out
the hope of pardon. A remarkable instance of this is set before us in Reuben;
who, after this extreme act of iniquity, yet retained his rank of a patriarch in
the Church. We must, however, remain under the custody of fear and watchfulness,
lest temptation should seize upon us unawares, and thus the snares of Satan
should envelop us. For the holy Spirit did not design to set before us an
example of vile lust, in order that every one might rush into incestuous
connections; but would rather expose to infamy the baseness of this crime, in an
honorable person, that all, on that account, might more vehemently abhor it.
This passage also refutes the error of Novatus. Reuben had been properly
instructed; he bore in his flesh, from early infancy, the symbol of the divine
covenant; he was even born again by the Spirit of God; we see, therefore, what
was the deep abyss from which he was raised by the incredible mercy of God. The
Novatians, therefore, and similar fanatics, have no right to cut off the hope of
pardon from the lapsed: for it is no slight injury to Christ, if we suppose the
grace of God to be more restricted by his
advent.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now the sons of Jacob
were twelve</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses again recounts the sons of
Jacob in a regular series. Reuben is put the first among them, not for the sake
of honor, but that he may be loaded with the greater opprobrium: for the greater
the honor which any one receives from the Lord, the more severely is he to be
blamed, if he afterwards makes himself the slave of Satan, and deserts his post.
Moses seems to insert this catalogue before the account of the death of Isaac,
for the purpose of discriminating between the progeny of Jacob and the Idumeans,
of whom he is about to make mention in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;013601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
36:1. For on the death of Isaac the fountain of the holy race became divided, as
into two streams; but since the adoption of God restrained itself to one branch
only, it was necessary to distinguish it from the
other.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the days of
Isaac</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The death of Isaac is not related in its
proper order, as will soon appear from the connection of the history: but, as we
have elsewhere seen, the figure <i>hysteron proteron</i> was familiar to Moses. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F581</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
When it is said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he died
old, and full of days</i></font><font face="Palatino">, the meaning is, that,
having fulfilled the course of his life, he departed by a mature death; this,
therefore, is ascribed to the blessing of God. Nevertheless, I refer these words
not merely to the duration of his life, but also to the state of his feelings;
implying that Isaac, being satisfied with life, willingly and placidly departed
out of the world. For we may see certain decrepit old men, who are not less
desirous of life then they were in the flower of their age; and with one foot in
the grave, they still have a horror of death. Therefore, though long life is
reckoned among the blessings of God; yet it is not enough for men to be able to
count up a great number of years; unless they feel that they have lived long,
and, being satisfied with the favor of God and with their own age, prepare
themselves for their departure. Now, in order that old men may leave their minds
formed to this kind of moderation, it behaves them to have a good conscience, to
the end, that they may not flee from the presence of God; for an evil conscience
pursues and agitates the wicked with terror. Moses adds, that Isaac was buried
by his two sons. For since, at that time, the resurrection was not clearly
revealed, and its first fruits had not yet appeared, it behaved the holy fathers
to be so much the more diligently trained in significant ceremonies, in order
that they might correct the impression produced by the semblance of destruction
which is presented in death. By the fact that Esau is put first, we are taught
again, that the fruit of the paternal benediction was not received by Jacob in
this life; for he who was the first-born by right, is still subjected to the
other, after his father's death.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now these are the generations of
Esau</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Though Esau was an alien from the Church
in the sight of God; yet since he also, as a son of Isaac, was favored with a
temporal blessing, Moses celebrates his race, and inscribes a sufficiently
lengthened catalogue of the people born from him. This commemoration, however,
resembles an honorable sepulture. For although Esau, with his posterity, took
the precedence; yet this dignity was like a bubble, which is comprised under the
figure of the world, and which quickly perishes. As, therefore, it has been
before said of other profane nations, so now Esau is exalted as on a lofty
theater. But since there is no permanent condition out of the kingdom of God,
the splendor attributed to him is evanescent, and the whole of his pomp departs
like the passing scene of the stage. The Holy Spirit designed, indeed, to
testify that the prophecy which Isaac uttered concerning Esau was not vain; but
he has no sooner shown its effect, than he turns away our eyes, as if he had
cast a veil over it, that we may confine our attention to the race of Jacob.
Now, though Esau had children by three wives, in whom afterwards the blessing of
God shone forth, yet polygamy is not, on that account, approved, nor the impure
lust of man excused: but in this the goodness of God is rather to be admired,
which, contrary to the order of nature, gave a good issue to evil
beginnings.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And went into the country from
the face of his brother Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses does not
mean that Esau departed purposely to give place to his brother; for he was so
proud and ferocious, that he never would have allowed himself to seem his
brother's inferior. But Moses, without regard to Esau's design, commends the
secret providence of God, by which he was driven into exile, that the possession
of the land might remain free for Jacob alone. Esau removed to Mount Seir,
through the desire of present advantage, as is elsewhere stated. Nothing was
less in his mind than to provide for his brother's welfare; but God directed the
blind man by his own hand, that he might not occupy that place in the land which
he had appointed for his own servant. Thus it often happens that the wicked do
good to the elect children of God, contrary to their own intention; and while
their hasty cupidity pants for present advantages, they promote the eternal
salvation of those whose destruction they have sometimes desired. Let us, then,
learn from the passage before us, to see, by the eyes of faith, both in
accidental circumstances (as they are called) and in the evil desires of men,
that secret providence of God, which directs all events to a result
predetermined by himself. For when Esau went forth, that he might live more
commodiously apart from his father's family, he is said to have departed from
the face of his brother, because the Lord had so determined it. It is stated
indefinitely, that he departed "into the country;" because, being in uncertainty
respecting his plan, he sought a home in various places, until Mount Seir
presented itself; and as we say, he went out at a venture. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F582</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And these are the generations of
Esau, the father of the Edomites</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F583</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Though Esau had two names, yet in this place the second name refers to his
posterity, who are called Idumeans. For, to make it appear what God had bestowed
upon him for the sake of his father Isaac, Moses expressly calls him the father
of a celebrated and famous people. And certainly, it served this purpose not a
little, to trace the effect and fulfillment of the prophecy in the progeny of
Esau. For if the promise of God so mightily flourished towards a stranger, how
much more powerfully would it put itself forth towards the children, to whom
pertaineth the adoption, and consequently the inheritance of grace? Esau was an
obscure man, and a sojourner in that country: whence therefore is it, that
suddenly rulers should spring from him, and a great body of people should
flourish, unless because the benediction which proceeded from the mouth of
Isaac, was confirmed by the result? For Esau did not reign in this desert
without opposition; since a people of no ignoble name previously inhabited Mount
Seir. On this account Moses relates that the men who had before inhabited that
land were mighty: so that it would not have been easy for a stranger to acquire
such power as Esau possessed, if he had not been divinely
assisted.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This was that Anah that found
the mules</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Mules are the adulterous offspring
of the horse and the ass. Moses says that Anal was the author of this
connection. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F584</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But I do not consider this as said in praise of his industry; for the Lord has
not in vain distinguished the different kinds of animals from the beginning. But
since the vanity of the flesh often solicits the children of this world, so that
they apply their minds to superfluous matters, Moses marks this unnatural
pursuit in Anah, who did not think it sufficient to have a great number of
animals; but he must add to them a degenerate race produced by unnatural
intercourse. Moreover, we learn hence, that there is more moderation among brute
animals in following the law of nature, than in men, who invent vicious
admixtures.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These are the kings that
reigned, etc</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We must keep in memory what we
have said a little before, that reprobates are suddenly exalted, that they may
immediately fall, like the herb upon the roofs, which is destitute of root, and
has a hasty growth, but withers the more quickly. To the two sons of Isaac had
been promised the honor that kings should spring from them. The Idumeans first
began to reign, and thus the condition of Israel seemed to be inferior. But at
length, lapse of time taught how much better it is, by creeping on the ground,
to strike the roots deep, than to acquire an extravagant pre-eminence for a
moment, which speedily vanishes away. There is, therefore, no reason why the
faithful, who slowly pursue their way, should envy the quick children of this
world, their rapid succession of delights; since the felicity which the Lord
promises them is far more stable, as it is expressed in the
psalm,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob
dwelt</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses confirms what he had before
declared, that, by the departure of Esau, the land was left to holy Jacob as its
sole possessor. Although in appearance he did not obtain a single clod; yet,
contented with the bare sight of the land, he exercised his faith; and Moses
expressly compares him with his father, who had been a stranger in that land all
his life. Therefore, though by the removal of his brother to another abode,
Jacob was no little gainer; yet it was the Lord's will that this advantage
should be hidden from his eyes, in order that he might depend entirely upon the
promise.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These are the generations of
Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twdlwt</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>toledoth</i> we are not so much to understand a genealogy, as a record of
events, which appears more clearly from the context. For Moses having thus
commenced, does not enumerate sons and grandsons, but explains the cause of the
envy of Joseph's brethren, who formed a wicked conspiracy against him, and sold
him as a slave: as if he had said "Having briefly summed up the genealogy of
Esau, I now revert to the series of my history, as to what happened to the
family of Jacob."
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F585</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Moreover, Moses being about to speak of the abominable wickedness of Jacob's
sons, begins with the statement, that Joseph was dear beyond the rest to his
father, because he had begotten him in his old age: and as a token of tender
love, had clothed him with a coat woven of many colors. But it was not
surprising that the boy should be a great favorite with his aged father, for so
it is wont to happen: and no just ground is here given for envy; seeing that
sons of a more robust age, by the dictate of nature, might well concede such a
point. Moses, however, states this as the cause of odium, that the mind of his
father was more inclined to him than to the rest. The brethren conceive enmity
against the boy, whom they see to be more tenderly loved by their father, as
having been born in his old age.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F586</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
If they did not choose to join in this love to their brother, why did they not
excuse it in their father? Hence, then, we perceive their malignant and perverse
disposition. But, that a manycoloured coat and similar trifles inflamed them to
devise a scheme of slaughter, is a proof of their detestable cruelty. Moses also
says that their hatred increased, because Joseph conveyed the evil speeches of
his brethren to their father. Some expound the word evil as meaning some
intolerable crime; but others more correctly suppose, that it was a complaint of
the boy that his brothers vexed him with their reproaches; for, what follows in
Moses, I take to have been added in explanation, that we may know the cause for
which he had been treated so ill and with such hostility. It may be asked, why
Moses here accuses only the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, when, afterwards, he does
not exempt the sons of Leah from the same charge? One, indeed, of her sons,
Reuben, was milder than any of the rest; next to him was Judah, who was his
uterine brother. But what is to be said of Simon? What of Levi? Certainly since
they were older, it is probable that they were leaders in the affair. The
suspicion may, however, be entertained, that because these were the sons of
concubines and not of true wives, their minds would be more quickly moved with
envy; as if their servile extraction, on the mother's side, subjected them to
contempt.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joseph dreamed a
dream</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses having stated what were the first
seeds of this enmity, now ascends higher, and shows that Joseph had been
elected, by the wonderful purpose of God, to great things; that this had been
declared to him in a dream; and that, therefore, the hatred of his brethren
broke forth into madness. God, however, revealed in dreams what he would do,
that afterwards it might be known that nothing had happened fortuitously: but
that what had been fixed by a celestial decree, was at length, in its proper
time, carried forward through circuitous windings to its completion. It had been
predicted to Abraham that his seed should be wanderers from the land of Canaan.
In order, then, that Jacob might pass over into Egypt, this method was divinely
appointed; namely, that Joseph, being president over Egypt in a time of famine,
might bring his father thither with his whole family, and supply them with food.
Now, from the facts first related, no one could have conjectured such a result.
The sons of Jacob conspire to put the very person to death, without whom they
cannot be preserved; yea, he who was ordained to be the minister of salvation to
them, is thrown into a well, and with difficulty rescued from the jaws of death.
Driven about by various misfortunes, he seems to be an alien from his father's
house. Afterwards, he is cast into prison, as into another sepulcher, where, for
a long time, he languishes. Nothing, therefore, was less probable than that the
family of Jacob should be preserved by his means, when he was cut off from it,
and carried far away, and not even reckoned among the living. Nor did any hope
of his liberation remain, especially from the time in which he was neglected by
the chief butler; but being condemned to perpetual imprisonment, he was left
there to rot. God, however, by such complicated methods, accomplishes what he
had purposed. Wherefore, in this history, we have not only a most beautiful
example of Divine Providence, but also two other points are added especially
worthy of notice: first, that the Lord performs his work by wonderful and
unusual modes; and, secondly, that he brings forth the salvation of his Church,
not from magnificent splendor, but from death and the grave. Besides, in the
person of Joseph, a lively image of Christ is presented, as will more fully
appear from the context. But since these subjects will be often repeated, let us
follow the thread of Moses' discourse. God, of his mere grace, conferred
peculiar honor on the boy, who was the last but one among twelve, in giving him
the priority among his brethren. For, by what merit or virtue shall we say that
he attained the lordship over his brethren? Afterwards he seemed, indeed, to
acquire this by his own great beneficence: but from the dream we learn, that it
was the free gift of God, which in no way depended upon Joseph's beneficence.
Rather, he was ordained to be chief, by the mere good pleasure of God, in order
that he might show kindness to his brethren. Now, since the Lord was, at that
time, wont to reveal his secrets by two methods &#8212; by visions and by dreams
&#8212; one of these kinds is here noted. For no doubt Joseph had often dreamed
in the common manner: but Moses shows that a dream was now divinely sent to him,
which might have the force and weight of an oracle. We know that dreams are
often produced by our daily thoughts: sometimes they are indications of an
unhealthy state of the body: but whenever God intends to make known his counsel
by dreams, he engraves on them certain marks, which distinguish them from
passing and frivolous imaginations, in order that their credibility and
authority may stand firm. Thus Joseph, being certainly persuaded that he had not
been deluded by an empty spectra, fearlessly announced his dream as a celestial
oracle. Now, although the dominion is promised to him under a rural symbol, it
is one which does not seem suitable for instruction to the sons of Jacob; for we
know that they were herdsman, not ploughmen. Since they had no harvest which
they could gather in, it seems hardly congruous that homage should be paid to
his <i>sheaf</i>: But perhaps God designedly chose this similitude, to show that
this prophecy was not founded upon the present fortunes of Joseph, and that the
material of his dominion would not consist in those things which were at hand,
but that it should be a future benefit, the cause of which was to be sought for
elsewhere than at home.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shalt thou indeed reign over
us?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here it is plainly shown to us that the
paternal favor of God towards the elect, is like a fan to excite against them
the enmity of the world. When the sons of Jacob heard that they were fighting in
vain against God, their unjust hatred ought, by such means, to have been
corrected. For it was as if God, setting himself in the midst, would repress
their fury by these words, "Your impious conspiring will be fruitless; for
although you boast, I have constituted as your chief, the man whose ruin your
wicked envy hurries you to seek." Perhaps, also, by this consolatory dream, he
intended to alleviate the trouble of the holy youth. Yet their obstinacy caused
it to be the more increased. Let us then learn not to be grieved if, at any
time, the shining of the grace of God upon us should cause us to be envied. The
sons of Jacob, however, were but too acute interpreters of the dream: yet they
deride it as a fable, because it was repugnant to their wishes. Thus it often
happens that they who are ill-disposed, quickly perceive what is the will of
God: but, because they feel no reverence, they despise it. To this contumacy,
however, succeeds a stupor which destroys their former
quick-sightedness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he dreamed yet another
dream</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The scope of this dream is the same. The
only difference is, that God, to inspire greater confidence in the oracle,
presents him with a figure from heaven. The brethren of Joseph had despised what
was said concerning the sheaves; the Lord now calls upon them to look towards
heaven, where his august Majesty shines forth. It may, however, be asked, how it
can be reconciled with fact, that his mother, who was now dead, could come and
bow down to him. The interpretation of certain Hebrews, who refer it to Bilhah,
is frigid, and the sense appears plain without such subterfuges: for the sun and
moon designate the head of the family on each side: thus, in this figure, Joseph
sees himself reverenced by the whole house of his
father.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And his father rebuked
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. If Jacob suspected that the dream
originated in vain ambition, he rightly rebuked his son; but if he knew that God
was the author of the dream, he ought not to have expostulated with him. But
that he did know it, may be hence inferred, because he is afterwards said
seriously to have considered it. For Moses, making a distinction between him and
his sons, says that <i>they</i> breathed nothing but the virus of envy; while
<i>he</i> revolved in his own mind what this might mean; which could not have
happened, unless he had been affected with reverence. But seeing that a certain
religious impression on the subject rested on his mind, how was it that he
rebuked his son? This truly was not giving honor to God and to his word. For it
ought to have occurred to the mind of Jacob that, although Joseph was under his
authority, he yet sustained a prophetic character. It is probable, when he saw
his sons so malevolent, that he wished to meet the danger by feigning what he
did not feel: for he was not offended at the dream, but he was unwilling to
exasperate the minds of those who, on account of their pride, would not bear to
be in subjection. Therefore I do not doubt that he feignedly reproved his son,
from a desire to appease contention. Nevertheless, this method of pretending to
be adverse to the truth, when we are endeavoring to appease the anger of those
who rage against it, is by no means approved by God. He ought rather ingenuously
to have exhorted his sons not to "kick against the pricks." Or at least he
should have used this moderate address, "If this is a common dream, let it be
treated with ridicule rather than with anger; but if it has proceeded from God,
it is wicked to speak against it." It is even possible that the unsuitableness
of the dream had struck the mind of the old man. For we know how difficult it is
entirely to throw off all sense of superiority. Certainly, though Jacob declines
slightly from the right course, yet his piety appears to be of no common order;
because his reverence for the oracle so easily prevailed over every other
feeling. But the most wicked obstinacy betrays itself in his sons, seeing they
break out into greater enmity. For though they despise the dream, yet they are
not made angry about nothing. Gladly would they have had their brother as a
laughing-stock; but a certain secret sense of the Deity constrains them, so
that, with or against their will, they are compelled to feel that there is
something authentic in the dream. Meanwhile, a blind ferocity impels them to an
unintentional resistance against God. Therefore, that we may be held in
obedience to God, let us learn to bring down our high spirits; because the
beginning of docility is for men to submit to be brought into order. This
obstinacy in the sons of Jacob was most censurable, because they not only
rejected the oracle of God through their hatred of subjection, but were hostile
to his messenger and herald. How much less excusable, then, will be our
hardness, if we do not meekly submit our necks to the yoke of God; since the
doctrine of humility, which subdues and even mortifies us, is not only more
clearly revealed, but also confirmed by the precious blood of Christ? If,
however, we see many refractory persons at this day, who refuse to embrace the
gospel, and who perversely rise up against it, let us not be disturbed as by
some new thing, seeing that the whole human race is infected with the disease of
pride; for by the gospel all the glory of the flesh is reduced to nothing;
rather let us know that all remain obstinate, except those who are rendered meek
by the subduing influence of the Spirit.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And his brethren
went</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Before Moses treats of the horrible
design of fratricide, he describes the journey of Joseph, and amplifies, by many
circumstances, the atrocity of the crime. Their brother approaches them in the
discharge of a duty, to make a fraternal inquiry after their state. He comes by
the command of his father; and obeys it without reluctance, as appears from his
answer. He searches them out anxiously; and though they had changed their place,
he spares neither labor nor trouble till he finds them. Therefore their cruelty
was something more than madness, seeing they did not shrink with horror from
contriving the death of a brother so pious and humane. We now see that Moses
does not relate, without a purpose, that a man met Joseph in his wanderings, and
told him that his brethren had departed to Dothan. For the greater was his
diligence in his indefatigable pursuit, so much the less excusable were they by
whom such an unworthy recompense was
repaid.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when they saw him afar
off</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here again Moses, so far from sparing the
fame of his own family by adulation, brands its chiefs with a mark of eternal
infamy, and exposes them to the hatred and execration of all nations. If, at any
time, among heathens, a brother murdered his brother, such impiety was treated
with the utmost severity in tragedies, that it might not pass into an example
for imitation. But in profane history no such thing is found, as that nine
brethren should conspire together for the destruction of an innocent youth, and,
like wild beasts, should pounce upon him with bloody hands. Therefore a
horrible, and even diabolical fury, took possession of the sons of Jacob, when,
having cast aside the sense of nature, they were thus prepared cruelly to rage
against their own blood.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But, in addition to
this wickedness, Moses condemns their impious contempt of God,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold this master of
dreams</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For why do they insult the unhappy
youth, except because he had been called by the celestial oracle to an
unexpected dignity? Besides, in this manner, they themselves proclaim their own
baseness more publicly than any one could do, who should purposely undertake
severely to chastise them. They confess that the cause why they persecuted their
brother was his having dreamed; as if truly this ass an inexpiable offense; but
if they are indignant at his dreams, why do they not rather wage war with God?
For Joseph deemed it necessary to receive, as a precious deposit, what had been
divinely revealed unto him. But because they did not dare directly to assail
God, they wrap themselves in clouds, that, losing sight of God, they may vent
their fury against their brother. If such blindness seized upon the patriarchs,
what shall become of the reprobates, whom obstinate malice drives along, so that
they do not hesitate to resist God even to the last? And we see that they
willingly disturb and excite themselves, as often as they are offended with the
threatenings and chastisements of God, and rise up against his ministers for the
sake of taking vengeance. The same thing, indeed, would at times happen to us
all, unless God should put on his bridle to render us submissive. With respect
to Joseph, the special favor of God was manifested to him, and he was raised to
the highest dignity; but only in a dream, which is ridiculed by the wicked scorn
of his brethren. To this is also added a conspiracy, so that he narrowly escaped
death. Thus the promise of God, which had exalted him to honor, almost plunges
him into the grave. We, also, who have received the gratuitous adoption of God
amidst many sorrows, experience the same thing. For, from the time that Christ
gathers us into his flock, God permits us to be cast down in various ways, so
that we seem nearer hell than heaven. Therefore, let the example of Joseph be
fixed in our minds, that we be not disquieted when many crosses spring forth to
us from the root of God's favor. For I have before showed, and the thing itself
clearly testifies, that in Joseph was adumbrated, what was afterwards more fully
exhibited in Christ, the Head of the Church, in order that each member may form
itself to the imitation of his example.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And cast him into some
pit</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Before they perpetrate the murder, they
seek a pretext whereby they may conceal their crime from men. Meanwhile, it
never enters into their mind, that what is hidden from men cannot escape the
eyes of God. But so stupid is hypocrisy, that while it flees from the disgrace
of the world, it is careless about the judgment of God. But it is a disease
deeply rooted in the human mind, to put some specious color on every extreme act
of iniquity. For although an inward judge convicts the guilty, they yet confirm
themselves in impudence, that their disgrace may not appear unto
others.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And we shall see what
will become of his dreams.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As if the truth of
God could be subverted by the death of one man, they boast that they shall have
attained their wish when they have killed their brother; namely, that his dreams
will come to nothing. This is not, indeed, their avowed purpose, but turbulent
envy drives them headlong to fight against God. But whatever they design in thus
contending with God in the dark, their attempts will, at length, prove vain. For
God will always find a way through the most profound abyss, to the
accomplishment of what he has decreed. If, then, unbelievers provoke us by their
reproaches, and proudly boast that our faith will profit us nothing; let not
their insolence discourage or weaken us, but let us confidently
proceed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Reuben heard
it</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It may be well to observe, while others
were hastening to shed his blood, by whose care Joseph was preserved. Reuben
doubtless, in one affair, was the most wicked of them all, when he defiled his
father's couch; and that unbridled lust, involving other vices, was the sign of
a depraved nature: now suddenly, he alone, having a regard to piety, and being
mindful of fraternal duty, dissolves the impious conspiracy. It is uncertain
whether he was now seeking the means of making some compensation, for the sake
of which he might be restored to his father's favor. Moses declares that it was
his intention to restore the boy in safety to his father: whence the conjecture
which I have stated is probable, that he thought the life of his brother would
be a sufficient price by which he might reconcile his father's mind to himself.
However this may be, yet the humanity which he showed in attempting to liberate
his brother, is a proof that he was not abandoned to every kind of wickedness.
And perhaps God, by this testimony of his penitence, designed in some degree to
lessen his former disgrace. Whence we are taught that the characters of men are
not to be estimated by a single act, however atrocious, so as to cause us to
despair of their salvation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cast him into this
pit</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The pious fallacy to which Reuben
descended, sufficiently proves with what vehemence the rage of his brethren was
burning. For he neither dares openly to oppose them, nor to dissuade them from
their crime; because he saw that no reasons would avail to soften them. Nor does
it extenuate their cruelty, that they consent to his proposal, as if they were
disposed to clemency; for if either one course or the other were necessary, it
would have been better for him immediately to die by their hands, than to perish
by slow hunger in the pit, which is the most cruel kind of punishment. Their
gross hypocrisy is rather to be noticed; because they think that they shall be
free from crime, if only they do not stain their hands with their brother's
blood. As if, indeed, it made any difference, whether they ran their brother
through with a sword, or put him to death by suffocation. For the Lord, when he
accuses the Jews by Isaiah, of having hands full of blood, does not mean that
they were assassins, but he calls them bloody, because they did not spare their
suffering brethren. Therefore, the sons of Jacob are nothing better, in casting
their brother alive under ground, that, as one buried, he might in vain contend
with death, and perish after protracted torments; and in choosing a pit in the
desert, from which no mortal could hear his dying cry, though his sighing would
ascend even to heaven. It was a barbarous thought, that they should not touch
his life, if they did not imbrue their hands in his blood; since it was a kind
of death, not less violent, which they wished to inflict by hunger. Reuben,
however, accommodating his language to their brutal conceptions, deemed it
sufficient to repress, by any kind of artifice, their impetuosity for the
present.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They stripped Joseph out of
his coat</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F587</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
We see that these men are full of fictions and lies. They carelessly strip their
brother; they feel no dread at casting him with their own hands into the pit,
where hunger worse than ten swords might consume him; because they hope their
crime will be concealed; and in taking home his clothes, no suspicion of his
murder would be excited; because, truly, their father would believe that he had
been torn by a wild beast. Thus Satan infatuates wicked minds, so that they
entangle themselves by frivolous evasions. Conscience is indeed the fountain of
modesty; but Satan so soothes by his allurements those whom he has entangled in
his snares, that conscience itself, which ought to have cited them as guilty
before the bar of God, only hardens them the more. For, having found out
subterfuges, they break forth far more audaciously into sin, as if they might
commit with impunity whatever escapes the eyes of men. Surely it is a reprobate
sense, a spirit of frenzy and of stupor, which is withheld from any daring
attempt, only by a fear of the shame of men; while the fear of divine judgment
is trodden under foot. And although all are not carried thus far, yet the fault
of paying more honor to men than to God, is too common. The repetition of the
word <i>coat</i> in the sentence of Moses is emphatical, showing that this mark
of the father's love could not mollify their
minds.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they sat down to eat
bread</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This was an astonishing barbarity, that
they could quietly feast, while, in intention, they were guilty of their
brother's death: for, had there been one drop of humanity in their souls, they
would at least have felt some inward compunctions; yea, commonly, the very worst
men are afraid after the commission of a crime. Since the patriarchs fell into
such a state of insensibility, let us learn, from their example, to fear lest,
by the righteous anger of God, the same lethargy should seize upon our senses.
Meanwhile, it is proper to consider the admirable progress of God's counsel.
Joseph had already passed through a double death: and now, as if by a third
death, he is, beyond all expectation, rescued from the grave. For what was it
less than death, to be sold as a slave to foreigners? Indeed his condition was
rendered worse by the chance; because Reuben, secretly drawing him out of the
pit, would have brought him back to his father: whereas now he is dragged to a
distant part of the earth, without hope of return. But this was a secret turn,
by which God had determined to raise him on high. And at length, he shows by the
event, how much better it was that Joseph should be led far away from his own
family, than that he should remain in safety at home. Moreover, the speech of
Judah, by which he persuades his brethren to <i>sell</i> Joseph, has somewhat
more reason. For he ingenuously confesses that they would be guilty of homicide,
if they suffered him to perish in the pit. What gain shall we make, he says, if
his blood be covered; for our hands will nevertheless be polluted with blood. By
this time their fury was in some degree abated, so that they listened to more
humane counsel; for though it was outrageous perfidy to sell their brother to
strangers; yet it was something to send him away alive, that, at least, he might
be nourished as a slave. We see, therefore, that the diabolical flame of
madness, with which they had all burned, was abating, when they acknowledged
that they could profit nothing by hiding their crime from the eyes of men;
because homicide must of necessity come into view before God. For at first, they
absolved themselves from guilt, as if no Judge sat in heaven. But now the sense
of nature, which the cruelty of hatred had before benumbed, begins to exert its
power. And certainly, even in the reprobate, who seem entirely to have cast off
humanity, time shows that some residue of it remains. When wicked and violent
affections rage, their tumultuous fervor hinders nature from acting its part.
But no minds are so stupid, that a consideration of their own wickedness will
not sometimes fill them with remorse: for, in order that men may come
inexcusable to the judgment-seat of God, it is necessary that they should first
be condemned by themselves. They who are capable of cure, and whom the Lord
leads to repentance, differ from the reprobates in this, that while the latter
obstinately conceal the knowledge of their crimes, the former gradually return
from the indulgence of sin, to obey the voice of reason. Moreover, what Judah
here declares concerning his brother, the Lord, by the prophet, extends to the
whole human race. Whenever, therefore, depraved lust impels to unjust violence,
or any other injury, let us remember this sacred bond by which the whole of
society is bound together, in order that it may restrain us from evil doings.
For man cannot injure men, but he becomes an enemy to his own flesh, and
violates and perverts the whole order of
nature.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then there passed by
Midianites</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some think that Joseph was twice
sold in the same place. For it is certain, since Median was the son of Abraham
and Keturah, that his sons were distinct from the sons of Ishmael: and Moses has
not thoughtlessly put down these different names. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F588</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But I thus interpret the passage: that Joseph was exposed for sale to any one
who chose, and seeing the purchase of him was declined by the Midianites, he was
sold to the Ishmaelites. Moreover, though they might justly suspect the sellers
of having stolen him, yet the desire of gain prevents them from making inquiry.
We may also add, what is probable, that, on the journey, they inquired who
Joseph was. But they did not set such a value on their common origin as to
prevent them from eagerly making gain. This passage, however, teaches us how far
the sons of Abraham, after the flesh, were preferred to the elect offspring, in
which, nevertheless, the hope of the future Church was included. We see that, of
the two sons of Abraham, a posterity so great was propagated, that from both
proceeded merchants in various places: while that part of his seed which the
Lord had chosen to himself was yet small. But so the children of this world,
like premature fruit, quickly arrive at the greatest wealth and at the summit of
happiness; whereas the Church, slowly creeping through the greatest
difficulties, scarcely attains, during a long period, to the condition of
mediocrity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he
returned</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We may hence gather that Reuben,
under pretense of some other business, stole away from his brethren, that,
unknown to them all, he might restore his brother, drawn out of the pit, to his
father; and that therefore he was absent at the time when Joseph was sold. And
there is no wonder that he was anticipated, when he had taken his course in a
different direction from theirs, intending to reach the pit by a circuitous
path. But now at length Reuben having lost all hope, unfolds to his brethren the
intention which before he dared not confess, lest the boy should be immediately
murdered.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they took Joseph's
coat</i></font><font face="Palatino">. They now return to their first scheme. In
order that their father may have no suspicion of their crime, they send the
bloody coat, from which he might conjecture that Joseph had been torn by some
wild beast. Although Moses alludes to this briefly, I yet think that they rather
sent some of their servants, who were not accessory to the crime, than any of
their number. For he says soon afterwards, that his sons and daughters came to
offer some consolation to him in his grief. And although in the words they use,
there lurks some appearance of insult, it seems to me more probable that they
gave this command to avert suspicion from themselves. For they feign themselves
to be of confused mind, as is usual in affairs of perplexity. Yet whatever they
intend, their wickedness drives them to this point, that they inflict a deadly
wound upon the mind of their father. This is the profit which hypocrites gain by
their disguises, that in wishing to escape the consequences of one fault, they
add sin to sin. With respect to Jacob, it is a wonder that after he had been
tried in so many ways, and always come forth a conqueror, he should now sink
under grief. Certainly it was very absurd that the death of his son should
occasion him greater sorrow than the incestuous pollution of his wife, the
slaughter of the Shechemites, and the defilement of his daughter. Where was that
invincible strength, by which he had even prevailed over the angel? Where the
many lessons of patience with which God had exercised him, in order that he
might never fail? This disposition to mourn, teaches us that no one is endued
with such heroic virtues, as to be exempt from that infirmity of the flesh,
which betrays itself sometimes even in little things; whence also it happens,
that they who have long been accustomed to the cross, and who like veteran
soldiers ought bravely to bear up against every kind of attack, fall like young
recruits in some slight skirmish. Who then among us may not fear for himself,
when we see holy Jacob faint, after having given so many proofs of
patience?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>35.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And all his sons and
daughters rose up</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The burden of his grief is
more clearly expressed by the circumstance that all his sons and daughters meet
together to comfort him. For by the term "rose up", is implied a common
deliberation, they having agreed to come together, because necessity urged them.
But hence it appears how vast is the innate dissimulation of men. The sons of
Jacob assume a character by no means suitable to them; and perform an office of
piety, from which their minds are most alien. If they had had respect unto God,
they would have acknowledged their fault, and though no remedy might have been
found for their evil, yet repentance would have brought forth some fruit; but
now they are satisfied with a vanity as empty as the wind. By this example we
are taught how carefully we ought to avoid dissimulation, which continually
implicates men in new
snares.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But he refused to be
comforted</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It may be asked, whether Jacob had
entirely cast off the virtue of patience: for so much the language seems to
mean. Besides, he sins more grievously, because he, knowingly and voluntarily,
indulges in grief: for this is as if he would purposely augment his sorrow,
which is to rebel against God. But I suppose his refusal to be restricted to
that alleviation of grief which man might offer. For nothing is more
unreasonable than that a holy man, who, all his life had borne the yoke of God
with such meekness of disposition, should now, like an unbroken horse, bite his
bridle; in order that, by nourishing his grief, he might confirm himself in
unsubdued impetuosity. I therefore do not doubt that he was willing now to
submit himself unto the Lord, though he rejects human consolations. He seems
also angrily to chide his sons, whose envy and malevolence towards Joseph he
knew, as if he would upbraid them by declaring that he esteemed this one son
more than all the rest: since he rather desires to be with him, dead in the
grave, than to enjoy the society of ten living sons whom he had yet remaining;
for I except little Benjamin. I do not, however, here excuse that excess of
grief which I have lately condemned. And certainly heproves himself to be
overwhelmed with sadness, in speaking of the grave, as if the sons of God did
not pass through death to a better life. And hence we learn the blindness of
immoderate grief, which almost quenches the light of faith in the saints; so
much the more diligent, then, ought we to be in our endeavor to restrain it. Job
greatly excelled in piety; yet we see, after he had been oppressed by the
magnitude of his grief, in what a profane manner he mixes men with beasts in
death. If the angelic minds of holy men were thus darkened by sadness, how much
deeper gloom will rest upon us, unless God, by the shining of his word and
Spirit, should scatter it, and we also, with suitable anxiety, meet the
temptation, before it overwhelms us? The principal mitigation of sorrow is the
consolation of the future life; to which whosoever applies himself, need not
fear lest he should be absorbed by excess of grief. Now though the immoderate
sorrow of Jacob is not to be approved; yet the special design of Moses was, to
set a mark of infamy on that iron hardness which cruelly reigned in the hearts
of his sons. They saw that, if their father should miserably perish, consumed
with grief, they would be the cause of it; in short, they saw that he was
already dying through their wickedness. If they are not able to heal the wound,
why, at least, do they not attempt to alleviate his pain? Therefore they are
exceedingly cruel, seeing that they have not sufficient care of their father's
life, to cause them to drop a single word in mitigation of his sorrow, when it
was in their power to do so.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>36.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Midianites sold him
into Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It was a sad spectacle, that Joseph
should be thus driven from one hand to another. For it added no small indignity
to his former suffering, that he is set to sale as a slave. The Lord, however,
ceased not to care for him. He even suffered him to be transferred from hand to
hand, in order that, at length, it might indeed appear, that he had come, by
celestial guidance, to that very dominion which had been promised him in his
dreams. Potiphar is called a eunuch, not because he was one really; but because,
among the Orientals, it was usual to denote the satraps and princes of the court
by that name. The Hebrews are not agreed respecting the dignity which Moses
ascribes to him; for some explain it as the "chief of the slaughterers," 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F589</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
whom the Greek interpreters follow. But I rather agree with others, who say that
he was "the prefect of the soldiers;" not that he had the command of the whole
army, but because he had the royal troops under his hand and authority: such are
now the captains of the guard, if you join with it another office which the
prefects of the prison exercise. For this may be gathered from

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to pass at that time,
that Judah</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Before Moses proceeds in relating
the history of Joseph, he inserts the genealogy of Judah, to which he devotes
more labor, because the Redeemer was thence to derive his origin; for the
continuous history of that tribe, from which salvation was to be bought, could
not remain unknown, without loss. And yet its glorious nobility is not here
celebrated, but the greatest disgrace of the family is exposed. What is here
related, so far from inflating the minds of the sons of Judah, ought rather to
cover them with shame. Now although, at first sight, the dignity of Christ seems
to be somewhat tarnished by such dishonor: yet since here also is seen that
"emptying" of which St. Paul speaks, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F591</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
it rather redounds to his glory, than, in the least degree, detracts from it.
First, we wrong Christ, unless we deem him alone sufficient to blot out any
ignominy arising from the misconduct of his progenitors, which offer to
unbelievers occasion of offense. Secondly, we know that the riches of God's
grace shines chiefly in this, that Christ clothed himself in our flesh, with the
design of making himself of no reputation. Lastly, it was fitting that the race
from which he sprang should be dishonored by reproaches, that we, being content
with him alone, might seek nothing besides him; yea, that we might not seek
earthly splendor in him, seeing that carnal ambition is always too much inclined
to such a course. These two things, then, we may notice; first, that peculiar
honor was given to the tribe of Judah, which had been divinely elected as the
source whence the salvation of the world should flow; and secondly, that the
narration of Moses is by no means honorable to the persons of whom he speaks; so
that the Jews have no right to arrogate anything to themselves or to their
fathers. Meanwhile, let us remember that Christ derives no glory from his
ancestors; and even, that he himself has no glory in the flesh, but that his
chief and most illustrious triumph was on the cross. Moreover, that we may not
be offended at the stains with which his ancestry was defiled, let us know that,
by his infinite purity, they were all cleansed; just as the sun, by absorbing
whatever impurities are in the earth and air, purges the
world.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Judah saw there a daughter of
a certain Canaanite</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I am not satisfied with
the interpretation which some give of "merchant" to the word Canaanite. For
Moses charges Judah with perverse lust, because he took a wife out of that
nation with which the children of Abraham were divinely commanded to be at
perpetual strife. For neither he nor his other brethren were ignorant that they
sojourned in the land of Canaan, under the stipulation, that afterwards their
enemies were to be cut off and destroyed, in order that they might possess the
promised dominion over it. Moses, therefore, justly regards it as a fault, that
Judah should entangle himself in a forbidden alliance; and the Lord, at length,
cursed the offspring thus accruing to Judah, that the prince and head of the
tribe of Judah might not be born, nor Christ himself descend, from this
connection. This also ought to be numbered among the exercises of Jacob's
patience, that a wicked grandson was born to him through Judah, of whose sin he
was not ignorant. Moses says, that the youth was cut off by the vengeance of
God. The same thing is not said of others whom a sudden death has swept away in
the flower of their age. I doubt not, therefore, that the wickedness, of which
death was the immediate punishment, was extraordinary, and known to all men. And
although this trial was in itself severe to the holy patriarch; yet nothing
tormented his mind more than the thought, that he could scarcely hope for the
promise of God to be so ratified that the inheritance of grace should remain in
the possession of wicked and abandoned men. It is true that a large family of
children is regarded as a source of human happiness. But this was the peculiar
condition of the holy patriarch, that, though God had promised him an elect and
blessed seed, he now sees an accursed progeny increase and shoot forth together
with his offspring, which might destroy the expected grace. It is said, <i>that
Er was wicked in the sight of the Lord</i>,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;013807&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
38:7.) Notwithstanding, his iniquity was not hidden from men. Moses, however,
means that he was not merely infected with common vices, but rather was so
addicted to crimes, that he was intolerable in the sight of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord slew
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We know that long life is reckoned among
the gifts of God; and justly: for since it is by no means a despicable honor
that we are created after the image of God, the longer any one lives in the
world, and daily experiences God's care over him, it is certain that he is the
more bountifully dealt with by the Lord. Even amidst the many miseries with
which life is filled, this divine goodness still shines forth, that God invites
us to himself, and exercises us in the knowledge of himself; while at the same
time he adorns us with such dignity, that he subjects to our authority whatever
is in the world. Wherefore it is no wonder that God, as an act of kindness,
prolongs the life of man. Whence it follows, that when the wicked are taken away
by a premature death, a punishment for their wickedness is inflicted upon them:
for it is as if the Lord should pronounce judgment from heaven, that they are
unworthy to be sustained by the earth, unworthy to enjoy the common light of
heaven. Let us therefore learn, as long as God keeps us in the world, to
meditate on his benefits, to the end that every one may the more cheerfully
endeavor to give praise to God for the life received from him. And although, at
the present day also, sudden death is to be reckoned among the scourges of God;
since that doctrine is always true,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Bloody and deceitful men
shall not live out half their
days,"</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;195523&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
55:23;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">yet God executed this judgment more fully under the
law, when the knowledge of a future life was comparatively obscure; for now,
since the resurrection is clearly manifested to us in Christ, it is not right
that death should be so greatly dreaded. And this difference between us and the
ancient people of God is elsewhere noted. Nevertheless, it can never be laid
down as a general rule, that they who had a long life were thereby proved to be
pleasing and acceptable to the Lord, whereas God has sometimes lengthened the
life of reprobates, in aggravation of their punishment. We know that Cain
survived his brother Abel many centuries. But as God does not always, and to all
persons, cause his temporal benefits manifestly to flow in a perpetual and
equable course; so neither, on the other hand, does he always execute temporal
punishments by the same rule. It is enough that, as far as the present life is
concerned, certain examples of punishments and rewards are set before us.
Moreover, as the miseries of the present life, which spring from the corruption
of nature, do not extinguish the first and special grace of God; so, on the
other hand, death, which is in itself the curse of God, is so far from doing any
injury, that it tends, by a supernatural remedy, to the salvation of the elect.
Especially now, from the time that the first-fruits of the resurrection in
Christ have been offered, the condition of those who are quickly taken out of
life is in no way deteriorated; because Christ himself is gain both for life and
death. But the vengeance of God was so clear and remarkable in the death of Er,
that the earth might plainly appear to have been purged as from its
filthiness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go in unto thy brother's
wife</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Although no law had hitherto been
prescribed concerning brother's marriages, that the surviving brother should
raise up seed to one who was dead; it is, nevertheless, not wonderful that, by
the mere instinct of nature, men should have been inclined to this course. For
since each man is born for the preservation of the whole race, if any one dies
without children, there seems to be here some defect of nature. It was deemed
therefore an act of humanity to acquire some name for the dead, from which it
might appear that they had lived. Now, the only reason why the children born to
the surviving brother, should be reckoned to him who had died, was, that there
might be no dry branch in the family; and in this manner they took away the
reproach of barrenness. Besides, since the woman is given as a help to the man,
when any woman married into a family, she was, in a certain sense, given up to
the name of that family. According to this reasoning, Tamar was not altogether
free, but was held under an obligation to the house of Judah, to procreate some
seed. Now, though this does not proceed from any rule of piety, yet the Lord had
impressed it upon the hearts of man as a duty of humanity; as he afterwards
commanded it to the Jews in their polity. Hence we infer the malignity of Onan,
who envied his brother this honor, and would not allow him, when dead, to obtain
the title of father; and this redounds to the dishonor of the whole family. We
see that many grant their own sons to their friends for adoption: it was,
therefore, an outrageous act of barbarity to deny to his own brother what is
given even to strangers.... 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F592</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Moreover he has not only shortened his brother concerning the right due to him,
but he rather spilled seed on the ground than to raise a son in his brother's
name.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the thing which he did
displeased the LORD</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Less neatly the Jews speak
about this matter. I will contend myself with briefly mentioning this, as far as
the sense of shame allows to discuss it. It is a horrible thing to pour out seed
besides the intercourse of man and woman. Deliberately avoiding the intercourse,
so that the seed drops on the ground, is double horrible. For this means that
one quenches the hope of his family, and kills the son, which could be expected,
before he is born. This wickedness is now as severely as is possible condemned
by the Spirit, through Moses, that Onan, as it were, through a violent and
untimely birth, tore away the seed of his brother out the womb, and as cruel as
shamefully has thrown on the earth. Moreover he thus has, as much as was in his
power, tried to destroy a part of the human race. When a woman in some way
drives away the seed out the womb, through aids, then this is rightly seen as an
unforgivable crime. Onan was guilty of a similar crime, by defiling the earth
with his seed, so that Tamar would not receive a future
inheritor.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then said Judah to
Tamar</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses intimates that Tamar was not at
liberty to marry into another family, so long as Judah wished to retain her
under his own authority. It is possible that she voluntarily submitted herself
to the will of her father-in-law, when she might have refused: but the language
seems to mean, that it was according to a received practice, that Tamar should
not pass over to another family, except at the will of her father-in-law, as
long as there was a successor who might raise up seed by her. However this may
be, Judah acted very unjustly in keeping one bound, whom he intended to defraud.
For truly there was no cause why he should be unwilling to allow her to depart
free from his house, unless he dreaded the charge of inconstancy. But he should
not have allowed this ambitious sense of shame to render him perfidious and
cruel to his daughter-in-law. Besides, this injury sprung from a wrong judgment:
because, without considering the causes of the death of his sons, he falsely and
unjustly transfers the blame to an innocent woman. He believes the marriage with
Tamar to have been an unhappy one; why therefore does he not, for his own sake,
permit her to seek a husband elsewhere? But in this also he does wrong, that
whereas the cause of his sons' destruction was their own wickedness, he judges
unfavorably of Tamar herself, to whom no evil could be imputed. Let us then
learn from this example, whenever anything adverse happens to us, not to
transfer the blame to another, nor to gather from all quarters doubtful
suspicions, but to shake off our own sins. We must also beware lest a foolish
shame should so prevail over us, that while we endeavor to preserve our
reputation uninjured among men, we should not be equally careful to maintain a
good conscience before God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it was told
Tamar</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses relates how Tamer avenged herself
for the injury done her. She did not at first perceive the fraud, but discovered
it after a long course of time. When Shelah had grown up, finding herself
deceived, she turned her thoughts to revenge. And it is not to be doubted that
she had long meditated, and, as it were, hatched this design. For the message
respecting Judah's departure was not brought to her accidentally; but, because
she was intent upon her purpose, she had set spies who should bring her an
account of all his doings. Now, although she formed a plan which was base, and
unworthy of a modest woman, yet this circumstance is some alleviation of her
crime, that she did not desire a connection with Judah, except while in a state
of celibacy. In the meantime, she is hurried, by a blind error of mind, into
another crime, not less detestable than adultery. For, by adultery, conjugal
fidelity would have been violated; but, by this incestuous intercourse, the
whole dignity of nature is subverted. This ought carefully to be observed, that
they who are injured should not hastily rush to unlawful remedies. It was not
lust which impelled Tamar to prostitute herself. She grieved, indeed, that she
had been forbidden to marry, that she might remain barren at home: but she had
no other purpose than to reproach her father-in-law with the fraud by which he
had deceived her: at the same time, we see that she committed an atrocious
crime. This is wont to happen, even in good causes, when any one indulges his
carnal affections more than is right. What Moses alludes to respecting garments
of widowhood, pertains to the law of modesty. For elegant clothing which may
attract the eyes of men, does not become widows. And therefore, Paul concedes
more to wives than to them; as having husbands whom they should wish to
please.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And sat in an open
place</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F593</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Interpreters expound this passage variously. Literally, it is "in the door of
fountains, or of eyes". Some suppose there was a fountain which branched into
two streams; others think that a broad place is indicated, in which the eyes may
look around in all directions. But a third exposition is more worthy of
reception; namely, that by this expression is meant a way which is forked and
divided into two; because then, as it were, a door is opened before the eyes,
that they which are really in one way may diverge in two directions. Probably it
was a place whence Tamer might be seen, to which some by-way was near, where
Judah might turn, so that he should not be guilty of fornication, in a public
way, under the eyes of all. When it is said she veiled her face, we hence infer
that the license of fornication was not so unbridled as that which, at this day,
prevails in many places. For she dressed herself after the manner of harlots,
that Judah might suspect nothing. And the Lord has caused this sense of shame to
remain engraved on the hearts of those who live wickedly, that they may be
witnesses to themselves of their own vileness. For if men could wash out the
stains from their sins, we know that they would do so most willingly. Whence it
follows, that while they flee from the light, they are affected with horror
against their will, that their conscience may anticipate the judgment of God. By
degrees, indeed, the greater part have so far exceeded all measure in stupor and
impudence, that they are less careful to hide their faults; yet God has never
suffered the sense of nature to be so entirely extinguished, by the brutal
intemperance of those who desire to sin with impunity, but that their own
obscenity shall compel even the most wicked to be ashamed. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F594</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Base was therefore the impudence of that cynic philosopher, who, being catched
in vice, boasted of planting a person. In short, the veil of Tamer shows that
fornication was not only a base and filthy thing in the sight of God and the
angels; but that it has always been condemned, even by those who have practiced
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When Judah saw
her</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It was a great disgrace to Judah that he
hastily desired intercourse with an unknown woman. He was now old; and therefore
age alone, even in a lascivious man, ought to have restrained the fervor of
intemperance. He sees the woman at a distance, and it is not possible that he
should have been captivated by her beauty. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F595</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The lust kindles him as a stallion neighs when it smells a mare. Hence we
gather, that the fear of God, or a regard to justice and prosperity, cannot have
flourished greatly in the heart of one who thus eagerly breaks forth to the
indulgence of his passions. He is therefore set before us as an example, that we
may learn how easily the lust of the flesh would break forth, unless the Lord
should restrain it; and thus, conscious of our infirmity, let us desire from the
Lord, a spirit of continence and moderation. But lest the same security should
steal over us, which caused Judah to precipitate himself into fornication; let
us mark, that the dishonor which Judah sustained in consequence of his incest,
was a punishment divinely inflicted upon him. Who then will indulge in a crime
which he sees, by this dreadful kind of vengeance, to be so very hateful to
God?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What wilt thou give me,
etc</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Tamar did not wish to make a gain by the
prostitution of her person, but to have a certain pledge, in order that she
might boast of the revenge taken for the injury she had received: and indeed
there is no doubt that God blinded Judah, as he deserved; for how did it happen
that he did not know the voice of his daughter-in-law, with which he had been
long familiar? Besides, if a pledge must be given for the promised kid, what
folly to deliver up his ring to a harlot? I pass over the absurdity of his
giving a double pledge. It appears, therefore, that he was then bereft of all
judgment; and for no other cause are these things written by Moses, than to
teach us that his miserable mind was darkened by the just judgment of God,
because, by heaping sin upon sin, he had quenched the light of the
Spirit.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Judah sent the
kid</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He sends by the hand of a friend, that he
may not reveal his ignominy to a stranger. This is also the reason why he does
not dare to complain of the lost pledges, lest he should expose himself to
ridicule. For I do not approve the sense given, by some, to the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let her take it to her, lest we
be shamed</i></font><font face="Palatino">, as if Judah would excuse himself, as
having fulfilled the promise he had given. Another meaning is far more suitable;
namely, that Judah would rather lose the ring, than, by spreading the matter
further, give occasion to the speeches of the vulgar; because lighter is the
loss of money than of character. He might also fear being exposed to ridicule
for having been so credulous. But he was chiefly afraid of the disgrace arising
from his fornication. Here we see that men who are not governed by the Spirit of
God are always more solicitous about the opinion of the world than about the
judgment of God. For why, when the lust of the flesh excited him, did it not
come into his mind, "Behold now I shall become vile in the sight of God and of
angels?" Why, at least, after his lust has cooled, does he not blush at the
secret knowledge of his sin? But he is secure, if only he can protect himself
from public infamy. This passage, however, teaches, what I have said before,
that fornication is condemned by the common sense of men, lest any one should
seek to excuse himself on the ground of
ignorance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to pass about
three months after</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Tamar might sooner have
exposed the crime; but she waited till she should be demanded for capital
punishment; for then she would have stronger ground for expostulation. The
reason why Judah subjects his daughter-in-law to a punishment so severe, was,
that he deemed her guilty of adultery: for what the Lord afterwards confirmed by
his law, appears then to have prevailed by custom among men, that a maid, from
the time of her espousals, should be strictly faithful to her husband. Tamar had
married into the family of Judah; she was then espoused to his third son. It was
not therefore simple and common fornication which was the question for judgment;
but the crime of adultery, which Judah prosecuted in his own right, because he
had been injured in the person of his son. Now this kind of punishment is a
proof that adultery has been greatly abhorred in all ages. The law of God
commands adulterers to be stoned. Before punishment was sanctioned by a written
law, the adulterous woman was, by the consent of all, committed to the flames.
This seems to have been done by a divine instinct, that, under the direction and
authority of nature, the sanctity of marriage might be fortified, as by a firm
guard: and although man is not the lord of his own body, but there is a mutual
obligation between himself and his wife, yet husbands who have had illicit
intercourse with unmarried women have not been subject to capital punishment;
because that punishment was awarded to women, not only on account of their
immodesty, but also, of the disgrace which the woman brings upon her husband,
and of the confusion caused by the clandestine admixture of seeds. For what else
will remain safe in human society, if license be given to bring in by stealth
the offspring of a stranger? To steal a name which may be given to spurious
offspring? And to transfer to them property taken away from the lawful heirs? It
is no wonder, then, that formerly the fidelity of marriage was so sternly
asserted on this point. How much more vile, and how much less excusable, is our
negligence at this day, which cherishes adulteries, by allowing them to pass
with impunity. Capital punishment, indeed, is deemed too severe for the measure
of the offense. Why then do we punish lighter faults with greater rigor? Truly,
the world was beguiled by the wiles of Satan, when it suffered the law, engraven
on all by nature, to become obsolete. meanwhile, a pretext has been found for
this gross madness, in that Christ dismissed the adulteress in safety,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430811&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
8:11,) as if, truly, he had undertaken to indict punishment upon thieves,
homicides, liars, and sorcerers. In vain, therefore, is a rule sought to be
established by an act of Christ, who purposely abstained from the office of an
earthly judge. It may however be asked, since Judah, who thus boldly usurps the
right of the sword, was a private person, and even a stranger in the land;
whence had he this great liberty to be the arbiter of life and death? I answer,
that the words ought not to be taken as if he would command, on his own
authority, his daughter-in-law to be put to death, or as if executioners were
ready at his nod; but because the offense was verified and made known, he, as
her accuser, freely pronounces concerning the punishment, as if the sentence had
already been passed by the judges. Indeed I do not doubt that assemblies were
then wont to be held, in which judgments were passed; and therefore I simply
explain, that Judah commanded Tamar to be brought forward in public; in order
that, the cause being tried, she might be punished according to custom. But the
specification of the punishment is to this effect, that the case is one which
does not admit of dispute; because Tamar is convicted of the crime before she is
cited to judgment.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Judah acknowledged
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The open reproach of Tamar proceeded from
the desire of revenge. She does not seek an interview with her father-in-law,
for the purpose of appeasing his mind; but, with a deliberate contempt of death,
she demands him as the companion of her doom. That Judah immediately
acknowledges his fault, is a proof of his honesty; for we see with how many
fallacies nearly all are wont to cover their sins, until they are dragged to the
light, and all means of denying their guilt have failed. Here, though no one is
present who could extort a confession, by force or threats, Judah voluntarily
stoops to make one, and takes the greater share of the blame to himself. Yet,
seeing that, in confessing his fault, he is now silent respecting punishment; we
hence infer, that they who are rigid in censuring others, are much more pliant
in forgiving themselves. In this, therefore, we ought to imitate him; that,
without rack or torture, truth should so far prevail with us, that we should not
be ashamed to confess, before the whole world, those sins with which God charges
us. But we must avoid his partiality; lest, while we are harsh towards others,
we should spare ourselves. This narrative also teaches us the importance of not
condemning any one unheard; not only because it is better that the innocent
should be absolved than that a guilty person should perish, but also, because a
defense brings many things to light, which sometimes render a change in the form
of judgment necessary.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>She
hath been more righteous than I</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The expression
is not strictly proper; for he does not simply approve of Tamar's conduct; but
speaks comparatively, as if he would say, that he had been, unjustly and without
cause, angry against a woman, by whom he himself might rather have been accused.
Moreover, by the result, it appears how tardily the world proceeds in exacting
punishment for crimes, where no private person stands forward to avenge his own
injury. An atrocious and horrible crime had been committed; as long as Judah
thought himself aggrieved, he pressed on with vehemence, and the door of
judgment was opened. But now, when the accusation is withdrawn, both escape;
though certainly it was the duty of all to rise up against them. Moses however
intimates that Judah was sincerely penitent; because "he knew" his
daughter-in-law "again no more." He also confirms what I have said before, that
by nature men are imbued with a great horror of such a crime. For whence did it
arise, that he abstained from intercourse with Tamar, unless he judged
naturally, that it was infamous for a father-in-law to be connected with his
daughter-in-law? Whoever attempts to destroy the distinction which nature
dictates, between what is base and what is honorable, engages, like the giants,
in open war with God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold twins were in her
womb</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Although both Judah obtained pardon for
his error, and Tamar for her wicked contrivance; yet the Lord, in order to
humble them, caused a prodigy to take place in the birth. Something similar had
before happened in the case of Jacob and Esau, but for a different reason: as we
know that prodigies sometimes portend good, sometimes evil. Here, however, there
is no doubt that the twins, in their very birth, bring with them marks of their
parents' infamy. For it was both profitable to themselves that the memory of
their shame should be renewed, and it served as a public example, that such a
crime should be branded with eternal disgrace. There is an ambiguity in the
meaning of the midwife's words. Some suppose the "breaking forth" to apply to
the membrane of the womb, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F596</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which is broken when the foetus comes forth. Others more correctly suppose, that
the midwife wondered how Pharez, having broken through the barrier interposed,
should have come out first; for his brother, who had preceded him, was, as an
intervening wall, opposed to him. To some the expression appears to be an
imprecation; as if it had been said, "Let the blame of the rupture be upon
thee." But Moses, so far as I can judge, intends to point out nothing more, than

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joseph was brought
down</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For the purpose of connecting it with the
remaining part of the history, Moses repeats what he had briefly touched upon,
that Joseph had been sold to Potiphar the Egyptian: he then subjoins that God
was with Joseph, so that he prospered in all things. For although it often
happens that all things proceed with wicked men according to their wish, whom
God nevertheless does not bless with his favor; still the sentiment is true and
the expression of it proper, that it is never well with men, except so far as
the Lord shows himself to be gracious to them. For he vouchsafes his blessing,
for a time, even to reprobates, with whom he is justly angry, in order that he
may gently invite and even allure them to repentance; and may render them more
inexcusable, if they remain obstinate; meanwhile, he curses their felicity.
Therefore, while they think they have reached the height of fortune, their
prosperity, in which they delighted themselves, is turned into ruin. Now
whensoever God deprives men of his blessing, whether they be strangers or of his
own household, they must necessarily decline; because no good flows except from
Him as the fountain. The world indeed forms for itself a goddess of fortune, who
whirls round the affairs of men; or each man adores his own industry; but
Scripture draws us away from this depraved imagination, and declares that
adversity is a sign of God's absence, but prosperity, a sign of his presence.
However, there is not the least doubt that the peculiar and extraordinary favor
of God appeared towards Joseph, so that he was plainly known to be blessed by
God. Moses immediately afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that Joseph was in the house of
his master</i></font><font face="Palatino">, to teach us that he was not at once
elevated to an honorable condition. There was nothing more desirable than
liberty; but he is reckoned among the slaves, and lives precariously, holding
his life itself subject to the will of his master. Let us then learn, even
amidst our sufferings, to perceive the grace of God; and let it suffice us, when
anything severe is to be endured, to have our cup mingled with some portion of
sweetness, lest we should be ungrateful to God, who, in this manner, declares
that he is present with us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And his master
saw</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here that which has been lately alluded to
more clearly appears, that the grace of God shone forth in Joseph, in no common
or usual manner; since it became thus manifest to a man who was a heathen, and,
in this respect, blind. How much more base is our ingratitude, if we do not
refer all our prosperous events to God as their author; seeing that Scripture
often teaches us, that nothing proceeding from men, whether counsels, or labors,
or any means which they can devise, will profit them, except so far as God gives
his blessing. And whereas Potiphar, on this account, conceived so much greater
regard for Joseph, as to set him over his house; we hence gather, that heathens
may be so affected by religion, as to be constrained to ascribe glory to God.
However, his ingratitude again betrays itself, when he despises that God whose
gifts he estimates so highly in the person of Joseph. He ought at least to have
inquired who that God was, that he might conform himself to the worship due to
him: but he deems it enough, insomuch as he thinks it will be for his private
advantage, to acknowledge that Joseph was divinely directed, in order that he
may use his labor with greater
profit.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The lord made all that
he did to prosper in his hand</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This was a
wonderful method of procedure, that the entire blessing by which the Lord was
pleased to testify his paternal love towards Joseph, should turn to the gain of
the Egyptians. For since Joseph neither sowed nor reaped for himself, he was not
at all enriched by his labor. But in this way it was brought about that a proud
man, who otherwise might have abused him as a vile and sordid slave, should
treat him humanely and liberally. And the Lord often soothes the wicked by such
favors, lest when they have suffered any injury, they should turn the fury of
their indignation against the pious. We here see how abundantly the grace of God
is poured out upon the faithful, since a portion of his kindness flows from them
even to the reprobate. We are also taught what an advantage it is to receive the
elect children of God to our hospitality, or to join ourselves to those whom the
divine favor thus accompanies, that it may diffuse its fragrance to those who
are near them. But since it would not greatly profit us to be saturated with
those temporal benefits of God, which suffocate and ruin the reprobate; we ought
to center all our wishes on this one point, that God may be propitious to us.
Far better was it for Joseph that Potiphar's wealth should be increased for his
sake; than it was for Potiphar to make great gain by
Joseph.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he left all that he
had</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F597</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Joseph reaped this fruit of the divine love and kindness towards him, that he
was cheered by some alleviation of his servitude, at least, for a short time.
But a new temptation soon assailed him. For the favor which he had obtained was
not only annihilated, but became the cause and origin of a harsher fortune.
Joseph was governor over the whole house of Potiphar. From that post of honor he
is hurried into prison, in order that he may be soon brought forth to the
punishment of death. What then could enter into his mind, but that he was
forsaken and abandoned by God, and was continually exposed to new dangers? He
might even imagine that God had declared himself his enemy. This history,
therefore, teaches us that the pious have need of peculiar discernment to enable
them, with the eyes of faith, to consider those benefits of God by which he
mitigates the severity of their crosses. For when he seems to stretch out his
hand to them, for the sake of bringing them assistance, the light which had
shone forth often vanishes in a moment, and denser darkness follows in its
place. But here it is evident, that the Lord, though he often plunges his own
people into the waves of adversity, yet does not deceive them; seeing that, by
sometimes moderating their sufferings, he grants them time to breathe. So
Joseph, though fallen from his office as governor of the house, was yet never
deserted; nor had that relaxation of his sufferings proved in vain, by which his
mind was raised, not to pride, but to the patient endurance of a new cross. And
truly for this end, God meets with us in our difficulties, that then, with
collected strength, as men refreshed, we may be the better prepared for other
conflicts.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joseph was a
goodly person, and well-favored</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Whereas
elegance of form was the occasion of great calamity to holy Joseph, let us learn
not greatly to desire those graces of person which may conciliate the favor of
the world; but rather let each be content with his own lot. We see to how many
dangers they are exposed, who excel in beauty; for it is very difficult for such
to restrain themselves from all lascivious desires. Although in Joseph religion
so prevailed that he abhorred all impurity; yet Satan contrived a means of
destruction for him, from another quarter, just as he is accustomed to turn the
gifts of God into snares whereby to catch souls. Wherefore we must earnestly ask
of God, that amid so many dangers, he would govern us by his Spirit, and
preserve those gifts with which he has adorned us, pure from every stain. When
it is said that Potiphar's wife "cast her eyes upon Joseph," the Holy Spirit, by
this form of speech, admonishes all women, that if they have chastity in their
heart, they must guard it by modesty of demeanor. For, on this account also,
they bear a veil upon their heads, that they may restrain themselves from every
sinful allurement: not that it is wrong for a woman to look at men; but Moses
here describes an impure and dissolute look. She had often before looked upon
Joseph without sin: but now, for the first time, she casts her eyes upon him,
and contemplates his beauty more boldly and wantonly than became a modest woman.
Thus we see that the eyes were as torches to inflame the heart to lust. By which
example we are taught that nothing is more easy, than for all our senses to
infect our minds with depraved desires, unless we are very earnestly on our
guard. For Satan never ceases diligently to suggest those things which may
incite us to sin. The senses both readily embrace the occasion of sin which is
presented to them, and also eagerly and quickly convey it to the mind. Wherefore
let every one endeavor sedulously to govern his eyes, and his ears, and the
other members of his body, unless he wishes to open so many doors to Satan, into
the innermost affections of his heart: and especially as the sense of the eyes
is the most tender, no common care must be used in putting them under
restraint.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lie with
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F598</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Moses only briefly touches upon the chief points, and the sum of the things he
relates. For there is no doubt that this impure woman endeavored, by various
arts, to allure the pious youth, and that she insinuated herself by indirect
blandishments, before she broke forth to such a shameless kind of license. But
Moses, omitting other things, shows that she had been pushed so far by base
lust, as not to shrink from openly soliciting a connection with Joseph. Now as
this filthiness is a signal proof that carnal lust acts from blind and furious
impulses; so, in the person of Joseph, an admirable example of fidelity and
continence is set before us. His fidelity and integrity appear in this, that he
acknowledges himself to be the more strictly bound, the greater the power with
which he is entrusted. Ingenuous and courageous men have this property, that the
more is confided to them, the less they can bear to deceive: but it is a rare
virtue for those who have the power of doing injury to cultivate honesty
gratuitously. Wherefore Joseph is not undeservedly commended by Moses, for
regarding the authority with which he was invested by his master, as a bridle to
restrain him from transgressing the bounds of duty. Besides, he gives also a
proof of his gratitude, in bringing forward the benefits received from his
master, as a reason why he should not subject him to any disgrace. And truly
hence arises at this day such confusion everywhere, that men are half brutal,
because this sacred bond of mutual society is broken. All, indeed, confess, that
if they have received any benefit from another, they are under obligation to
him: one even reproaches another for his ingratitude; but there are few who
sincerely follow the example of Joseph. Lest, however, he should seem to be
restrained only by a regard to man, he also declares that the act would be
offensive to God. And, indeed, nothing is more powerful to overcome temptation
than the fear of God. But he designedly commends the generosity of his master,
in order that the wicked woman may desist from her abandoned purpose. To the
same point is the objection which he mentions,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Neither hath he kept anything
back from me but thee, because thou art his
wife</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Why does he say this, except that, by
recalling the religious obligation of marriage, he may wound the corrupt mind of
the woman, and may cure her of her insane passion? Therefore he not only
strenuously strives to liberate himself from her wicked allurements; but, lest
her lusts should prove indomitable, he proposes to her the best remedy. And we
may know that the sanctity of marriage is here commended to us in the history of
Joseph, whereby the Lord would declare himself to be the maintainer of
matrimonial fidelity, so that none who violate another's bed should escape his
vengeance. For he is a surety between the man and his wife, and requires mutual
chastity from each. Whence it follows that, besides the injury inflicted upon
man, God himself is grievously wronged.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As she spake to Joseph day by
day</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The constancy of Joseph is commended; from
which it appears that a real fear of God reigned in his mind. Whence it came to
pass that he not only repelled one attack, but stood forth, to the last, the
conqueror of all temptations. We know how easy it is to fall when Satan tempts
us through another: because we seem exempt from blame, if he who induces us to
commit the crime, bears a part of it. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F599</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Holy Joseph, therefore, must have been endowed with the extraordinary power of
the Spirit, seeing that he stood invincible to the last, against all the
allurements of the impious woman. So much the more detestable is the wickedness
of her, who is neither corrected by time, nor restrained by many repulses. When
she sees a stranger, and one who had been sold as a slave, so discreet and so
faithful to his master, when she is also sacredly admonished by him not to
provoke the anger of God, how indomitable is that lust which gives no place to
shame. Now, because we here see into what evils persons will rush, when regard
to propriety is extinguished by carnal intemperance, we must entreat the Lord
that He will not suffer the light of his Spirit to be quenched within
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to pass about
this time</i></font><font face="Palatino">. That is, in the process of time,
seeing she will not desist from soliciting holy Joseph, it happens at length,
that she adds force to blandishments. Now, Moses here describes the crisis 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F600</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of the combat. Joseph had already exhibited a noble and memorable example of
constancy; because, as a youth, so often tempted, through a constant succession
of many days, he had preserved the even tenor of his way; and at that age, to
which pardon is wont to be granted, if it break forth into intemperance, he was
more moderate than almost any old man. But now when the woman openly raves, and
her love is turned into fury, the more arduous the contest has become, the more
worthy of praise is his magnanimity, which remains inflexible against this
assault. Joseph saw that he must incur the danger of losing both his character
and his life: he chose to sacrifice his character, and was prepared to
relinquish life itself, rather than to be guilty of such wickedness before God.
Seeing the Spirit of God proposes to us such an example in a youth, what excuse
does he leave for men and women of mature age, if they voluntarily precipitate
themselves into crime, or fall into it by a light temptation? To this,
therefore, we must bend all our efforts, that regard for God alone, may prevail
to subdue all carnal affections, and even that we may more highly value a good
and upright conscience than the plaudits of the whole world. For no one will
prove that he heartily loves virtue, but he who, being content with God as his
only witness, does not hesitate to submit to any disgrace, rather than decline
from the path of duty. And truly, since even among heathens such proverbs as
these are current, "that conscience is a thousand witnesses", and that it is "a
most beautiful theater", we should be greatly ashamed of our stupor, unless the
tribunal of God stands so conspicuously in our view, as to cast all the perverse
judgments of the world into the shade. Therefore, away with those vain pretexts,
"I wish to avoid offense", "I am afraid lest men should interpret amiss what I
have done aright;" because God does not regard himself as being duly honored,
unless we, ceasing to be anxious about our own reputation, follow wheresoever he
alone calls us; not that he wishes us simply to be indifferent to our own
reputation, but because it is an indignity, as well as an absurdity, that he
should not be preferred to men. Let, then, the faithful, as much as in them
lies, endeavor to edify their neighbors by the example of an upright life; and
for this end, let them prudently guard against every mark of evil; but if it be
necessary to endure the infamy of the world, let them through this temptation
also, proceed in the direction of their divine
vocation.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He hath brought in
an Hebrew unto us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here we see what desperation
can effect. For the wicked woman breaks forth from love into fury. Whence it
clearly appears what brutal impulses lust brings with it, when its reins are
loosened. Certainly alien Satan has once gained the dominion over miserable men,
he never ceases to hurry them hither and thither, until he drives them headlong
by the spirit of giddiness and madness. We see, also, how he hardens to
obstinacy the reprobate, whom he holds fast bound under his power. God, indeed,
often inspires the wicked with terror, so that they commit their crimes with
trembling. And it is possible that the signs of a guilty conscience appeared in
the countenance and in the words of this impure woman: nevertheless, Satan
confirms her in that degree of hardness, that she boldly adopts the design to
ruin the holy youth; and, at the moment, contrives the fraud by which she may
oppress him, though innocent, just as if she had long meditated, at leisure, on
his destruction. She had before sought secrecy, that no witness might be
present; now she calls her domestics, that, by this kind of prejudging of the
case, she may condemn the youth before her husband. Besides, she involves her
husband in the accusation, that she may compel him, by a sense of shame, to
punish the guiltless. "It is by thy fault, (she says,) that this stranger has
been mocking me." What other course does she leave open to her husband, than
that he should hasten, with closed eyes, to avenge her, for the sake of purging
himself from this charge? Therefore, though all wicked persons are fearful, yet
they contract such hardness from their stupor, that no fear hinders them from
rushing obstinately forward into every abyss of iniquity, and insolently
trampling upon the good and simple. And we must obscene this trial of the holy
man, in order that we may take care to be clothed with that spirit of fortitude,
which not even the iron-hardness of the wicked shall be able to break. Even this
other trial was not a light one, that he receives so unworthy a reward of his
humanity. He had covered the disgrace of the woman in silence, in order that she
might have had opportunity to repent, if she had been curable; he now sees that,
by his modesty, he has brought himself into danger of death. We learn, by his
not sinking under the trial, that it was his sincere determination to yield
himself freely to the service of God. And we must do the same, in order that the
ingratitude of men may, by no means, cause us to swerve from our
duty.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When his master heard the
words of his wife</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Seeing that a color so
probable was given to the transaction, there is no wonder that jealousy, the
motions of which are exceedingly vehement and ardent, should so far have
prevailed with Potiphar, as to cause him to credit the calumnies of his wife.
Yet the levity with which he instantly thrust a servant, whom he had found
prudent and honest, into prison, without examining the cause, cannot be excused.
He ought certainly to have been less under the influence of his wife. And,
therefore, he received the just reward of his too easy folly, by cherishing with
honor, a harlot in the place of a wife, and by almost performing the office of a
pander. This example is useful to all; yet husbands especially are taught that
they must use prudence, lest they should be carried rashly hither and thither,
at the will of their wives. And, truly, since we everywhere see that they who
are too obsequious to their wives are held up to ridicule; let us know that the
folly of these men is condemned by the just judgment of God, so that we may
learn to pray for the spirit of gravity and moderation. There is no doubt that
Moses expressly condemns the rashness of Potiphar, in becoming inflamed against
Joseph, as soon as he had heard his wife, and in giving the reins to his
indignation, just as if the guilt of Joseph had been proved; for thus all equity
is excluded, no just defense is allowed, and finally, the true and accurate
investigation of the cause is utterly rejected. But it may be asked, How could
the jealousy of Potiphar be excited, since Moses before has said that he was an
eunuch? 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F601</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The solution of the question is easy; they were accustomed to be called eunuchs
in the East, not only who were so really, but who were satraps and nobles.
Wherefore, this name is of the same force as if Moses had said that he was one
of the chief men of the court. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F602</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And put him into the
prison</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Though Moses does not state with what
degree of severity Joseph was afflicted at the beginning of his imprisonment,
yet we readily gather that he was not allowed any liberty, but was thrust into
some obscure dungeon. The authority of Potiphar was paramount; he had the keeper
of the prison under his power, and at his disposal. What clemency could be hoped
for from a man who was jealous and carried away with the vehemence of his anger?
There is no doubt that what is related of Joseph in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A518&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
105:18,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">had been handed down by tradition from the fathers.
What a reward of innocence! For, according to the flesh, he might ascribe
whatever he was suffering to his integrity. Truly, in this temptation he must
have mourned in great perplexity and anxiety before God. And though Moses does
not record his prayers, yet, since it is certain that he was not crushed beneath
the cross, and did not murmur against it, it is also probable that he was
reposing on the hope of Divine help. And to flee unto God is the only stay which
will support us in our afflictions, the only armor which renders us
invincible.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the Lord was with
Joseph</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It appears, from the testimony of the
Psalmist just cited, that Joseph's extreme sufferings were not immediately
alleviated. The Lord purposely suffered him to be reduced to extremity, that he
might bring him back as from the grave. We know that as the light of the sun is
most clearly seen when we are looking from a dark place; so, in the darkness of
our miseries, the grace of God shines more brightly when, beyond expectation, he
succors us. Moreover, Moses says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Lord was with
Joseph,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> because he extended this grace or mercy
towards him; whence we may learn, that God, even when he delivers us from unjust
violence, or when he assists us in a good cause, is yet induced to do so by his
own goodness. For since we are unworthy that he should grant us his help, the
cause of its communication must be in himself; seeing that he is merciful.
Certainly if merits, which should lay God under obligation, are to be sought for
in men, they would have been found in Joseph; yet Moses declares that he was
assisted by the gratuitous favor of God. This, however, is no obstacle to his
leaving received the reward of his piety, which is perfectly consistent with the
gratuitous kindness of God. The manner of exercising this kindness is also
added; namely, that the Lord gave him favor with the keeper of the prison. There
is, indeed, no doubt that Joseph was acceptable to the keeper for many reasons:
for even virtue conciliates favor to itself; and Moses has before shown that the
holy man was amiable in many ways; but because it often happens that the
children of God are treated with as great inhumanity as if they were the worst
of all men, Moses expressly states that the keeper of the prison, at length,
became humane; because his mind, which was not spontaneously disposed to equity,
had been divinely inclined to it. Therefore, that the keeper of the prison,
having laid aside his cruelty, acted with kindness and gentleness, was a change
which proceeded from God, who governs the hearts of men according to his own
will. But it is a wonder that the keeper of the prison did not fear lest he
should incur the displeasure of Potiphar: and even that Potiphar himself, who
without difficulty could have interfered, should yet have suffered a man whom he
mortally hated to be thus kindly and liberally treated. It may be answered with
truth, that his cruelty had been divinely restrained: but it is also probable
that he had suspected, and at length, been made acquainted with the subtle
scheme of his wife. Although, however, he might be appeased towards holy Joseph,
he was unwilling to acquit him to his own dishonor. Meanwhile the remarkable
integrity of Joseph manifests itself in this, that when he is made the guard of
the prison, and has the free administration of it, he nevertheless does not
attempt to escape, but waits for the proper season of his
liberation.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">CHAPTER

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it came to pass after these
things</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We have already seen, that when Joseph
was in bonds, God cared for him. For whence arose the relaxation afforded him,
but from the divine favor? Therefore, God, before he opened the door for his
servant's deliverance, entered into the very prison to sustain him with his
strength. But a far more illustrious benefit follows; for he is not only
liberated from prison, but exalted to the highest degree of honor. In the
meantime, the providence of God led the holy man through wonderful and most
intricate paths. The butler and baker of the king are cast into the prison;
Joseph expounds to them their dreams. Restoration to his office having been
promised to the butler, some light of hope beams upon the holy captive; for the
butler agreed, after he should have returned to his post, to become the advocate
for Joseph's pardon. But, again, that hope was speedily cut off, when the butler
failed to speak a word to the king on behalf of the miserable captive. Joseph,
therefore, seemed to himself to be buried in perpetual oblivion, until the Lord
again suddenly rekindles the light which had been smothered, and almost
extinguished. Thus, when he might have delivered the holy man directly from
prison, he chose to lead him around by circuitous paths, the better to prove his
patience, and to manifest, by the mode of his deliverance, that he has wonderful
methods of working, hidden from our view. He does this that we may learn not to
measure, by our own sense, the salvation which he has promised us; but that we
may suffer ourselves to be turned hither or thither by his hand, until he shall
have performed his work. By the butler and the baker we are not to understand
any common person of each rank, but those who presided over the rest; for, soon
afterwards, they are called eunuchs or nobles. Ridiculous is the fiction of the
trifler Gerundensis, who, according to his manner, asserts that they were made
eunuchs for the sake of infamy, because Pharaoh had been enraged against them.
They were, in short, two of the chief men of the court. Moses now more clearly
declares that the prison was under the authority of Potiphar. Whence we learn
what I have before said, that his anger had been mitigated, since without his
consent, the jailer could not have acted with such clemency towards Joseph. Even
Moses ascribes such a measure of humanity to Potiphar, that he committed the
butler and baker to the charge of Joseph. Unless, perhaps, a new successor had
been then appointed in Potiphar's place; which, however, is easily refuted from
the context, because a little afterwards Moses says that the master of Joseph
was the captain of the guard,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014003&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
40:3.) When Moses says they were kept in prison <i>a season</i>, some understand
by the word, <i>a whole year</i>; but in my judgment they are mistaken; it
rather denotes a long but uncertain time, as appears from other
places.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they dreamed a
dream</i></font><font face="Palatino">. What I have before alluded to respecting
dreams must be recalled to memory; namely, that many frivolous things are
presented to us, which pass away and are forgotten; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F603</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
some, however, have the force and significance of prophecy. Of this kind were
these two dreams, by which God made known the hidden result of a future matter.
For unless the mark of a celestial oracle had been engraven upon then, the
butler and the baker would not have been in such consternation of mind. I
acknowledge, indeed, that men are sometimes vehemently agitated by vain and
rashly conceived dreams; yet their terror and anxiety gradually subsides; but
God had fixed an arrow in the minds of the butler and the baker, which would not
suffer them to rest; and by this means, each was rendered more attentive to the
interpretation of his dream. Moses, therefore, expressly declares that it was a
presage of something certain.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joseph came in unto them, in
the morning</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As I have lately said, we ought
here to behold, with the eyes of faith, the wonderful providence of God. For,
although the butler and baker are certainly informed of their own fate; yet this
was not done so much out of regard to them, as in favor of Joseph; whom God
designed, by this method, to make known to the king. Therefore, by a secret
instinct he had rendered them sad and astonished, as if he would lead them by
the hand to his servant Joseph. It is, however, to be observed, that by a new
inspiration of the Spirit, the gift of prophecy, which he had not before
possessed, was imparted to him in the prison. When he had previously dreamed
himself, he remained, for a while, in suspense and doubt respecting the divine
revelation; but now he is a certain interpreter to others. And though, when he
was inquiring into the cause of their sadness, he perhaps did not think of
dreams; yet, from the next verse it appears that he was conscious to himself of
having received the gift of the Spirit; and, in this confidence, he exhorts them
to relate the dreams, of which he was about to be the interpreter.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Do not
interpretations</i></font><font face="Palatino"> (he says)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>belong to
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">? Certainly he does not arrogantly transfer
to himself what he acknowledges to be peculiar to God; but according to the
means which his vocation supplied, he offers them his service. This must be
noted, in order that no one may undesignedly usurp more to himself than he knows
that God has granted him. For, on this account, Paul so diligently teaches that
the gifts of the Spirit are variously distributed,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 12:4,) and that God has assigned to each a certain post, in order
that no one may act ambitiously, or intrude himself into another's office; but
rather that each should keep himself within the bounds of his own calling.
Unless this degree of moderation shall prevail, all things will necessarily be
thrown into confusion; because the truth of God will be distorted by the foolish
temerity of many; peace and concord will be disturbed, and, in short, no good
order will be maintained. Let us learn, therefore, that Joseph confidently
promised an interpretation of the dreams, because he knew that he was furnished
and adorned with this gift by God. The same remark applies to his interrogation
respecting the dreams. For he does not attempt to proceed beyond what his own
power authorized him to do: he does not, therefore, divine what they had
dreamed, but confesses it was hidden from him. The method pursued by Daniel was
different, for he was enabled, by a direct revelation, to state and interpret
the dream which had entirely escaped the memory of the king of Babylon.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;270228&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
2:28.) He, therefore, relying upon a larger measure of the Spirit, does not
hesitate to profess that he can both divine and interpret dreams. But Joseph, to
whom the half only of these gifts was imparted, keeps himself within legitimate
bounds. Besides, he not only guards himself against presumption; but, by
declaring that whatever he has received is from God, he ingenuously testifies
that he has nothing from himself. He does not, therefore, boast of his own
quickness or clear-sightedness, but wishes only to be known as the servant of
God. Let those who excel, follow this rule; lest, by ascribing too much to
themselves, (which commonly happens,) they obscure the grace of God. Moreover,
this vanity is to be restrained, not only that God alone may be glorified, and
may not be robbed of his right; but that prophets, and teachers, and all others
who are indued with heavenly grace, may humbly submit themselves to the
direction of the Spirit. What Moses says is also to be observed, that Joseph was
concerned at the sadness of those who were with him in prison. For thus men
become softened by their own afflictions, so that they do not despise others who
are in misery; and, in this way, common sufferings generate sympathy. Wherefore
it is not wonderful that God should exercise us with various sorrows; since
nothing is more becoming than humanity towards our brethren, who, being weighed
down with trials, lie under contempt. This humanity, however, must be learned by
experience; because our innate ferocity is more and more inflated by
prosperity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The three branches are three
days</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Joseph does not here offer what he
thought to be probable, like some ambiguous conjecturer; but asserts, by the
revelation of the Spirit, the meaning of the dream. For why does he say, that by
the three branches, three <i>days</i> rather than <i>years</i> are signified,
unless because the Spirit of God had suggested it? Joseph, therefore, proceeds,
by a special impulse above nature, to expound the dream; and by immediately
commending himself to the butler, as if he was already restored, shows how
certain and indubitable was the truth of his interpretation: as if he had said,
"Be convinced that what thou hast heard of me has come from God." Where also he
shows how honorably he thinks of the oracles of God, seeing that he pronounces
concerning the future effect with as much confidence as if it had already taken
place. But it may be deemed absurd, that Joseph asks for a reward of his
prophecy. I answer, that he did not speak as one who would set the gift of God
to sale: but it came into his mind, that a method of deliverance was now set
before him by God, which it was not lawful for him to reject. Indeed, I do not
doubt that a hope of better fortune had been divinely imparted to him. For God,
who, even from his childhood, had twice promised him dominion, did not leave
him, amidst so many straits, entirely destitute of all consolation. Now this
opportunity of seeking deliverance was offered to him by none but God.
Wherefore, it is not surprising that Joseph should thus make use of it. With
respect to the expression, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lift
up thine head;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> it signifies to raise any one
from a low and contemptible condition, to one of some reputation. Therefore,
"</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pharaoh will lift up thine
head,"</i></font><font face="Palatino"> means, he will bring thee forth from the
darkness of the prisons, or he will raise thee who art fallen, and restore thee
to thy former rank. For I take the word to mean simply <i>place</i> or
<i>rank</i>, and not <i>basis</i>. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F604</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Show kindness I pray thee
unto me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F605</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Although the expression show kindness is used among the Hebrews to describe the
common exercise of humanity; there is yet no doubt that Joseph spoke simply as
his own sad and afflicted condition suggested, for the purpose of inclining the
mind of the butler to procure him help. He insists, however, chiefly on this,
that he had been thrust into prison for no crime, in order that the butler might
not refuse his assistance to an innocent man. For although they who are most
wicked find patrons; yet commendation elicited by importunity, which rescues a
wicked man from deserved punishment, is in itself an odious and infamous thing.
It is, however, probable that Joseph explained his whole cause, so that he fully
convinced the butler of his innocence.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When the chief baker
saw</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F606</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He does not care respecting the skill and fidelity of Joseph as an interpreter;
but because Joseph had brought good and useful tidings to his companion, he also
desires an interpretation, which he hopes will prove according to his mind. So,
many, with ardor and alacrity, desire the word of God, not because they simply
wish to be governed by the Lord, and to know what is right, but because they
dream of mere enjoyment. When, however, the doctrine does not correspond with
their wishes, they depart sorrowful and wounded. Now, although the explanation
of the dream was about to prove unpleasant and severe; yet Joseph, by declaring,
without ambiguity, what had been revealed unto him, executed with fidelity the
office divinely committed to him. This freedom must be maintained by prophets
and teachers, that they may not hesitate, by their teaching, to inflict a wound
on those whom God has sentenced to death. All love to be flattered. Hence the
majority of teachers, in desiring to yield to the corrupt wishes of the world,
adulterate the word of God. Wherefore, no one is a sincere minister of God's
word, but he, who despising reproach, and being ready, as often as it may be
necessary, to attack various offenses, will frame his method of teaching
according to the command of God. Joseph would, indeed, have preferred to augur
well concerning both; but since it is not in his power to give a prosperous
fortune to any one, nothing remains for him but frankly to pronounce whatever he
has received from the Lord. So, formerly, although the people chose for
themselves prophets who would promise them abundance of wine and oil and corn,
while they exclaimed loudly against the holy prophets, because they let fall
nothing but threatening, (for these complaints are related in Micah,) yet it was
the duty of the servants of the Lord, who had been sent to denounce vengeance,
to proceed with severity, although they brought upon themselves hatred and
danger.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pharaoh shall lift up thy
head from off thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This phrase (in the
original) is ambiguous without some addition; and may be taken in a good or a
bad sense; just as we say, "With <i>regard</i> to any one," or "With
<i>respect</i> to him;" here the expression is added "from thee." Yet there
seems to be an allusion of this kind, as if Joseph had said, "Pharaoh will lift
up thy head, that he may take it off." Now, when Moses relates, that what Joseph
had predicted happened to both of them, he proves by this sign that Joseph was a
true prophet of God, as it is written in Jeremiah.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;242809&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
28:9.) For that the prophets sometimes threatened punishments, which God
abstained from inflicting, was done for this reason, because to such prophecies
a condition was annexed. But when the Lord speaks positively by his servants, it
is necessary that whatever he predicts should be confirmed by the result.
Therefore, Moses expressly commends in Joseph, his confidence in the heavenly
oracle. With regard to what Moses records, that Pharaoh celebrated his birthday
by a great feast, we know that this custom has always been in use, not only
among kings, but also among plebeian men. Nor is the custom to be condemned, if
only men would keep the right end in view; namely, that of giving thanks unto
God by whom they were created and brought up, and whom they have found, in
innumerable ways, to be a beneficent Father. But such is the depravity of the
world, that it greatly distorts those things which formerly were honestly
instituted by their fathers, into contrary corruptions. Thus, by a vicious
practice, it has become common for nearly all to abandon themselves to luxury
and wantonness on their birthday. In short, they keep up the memory of God, as
the Author of their life, in such a manner as if it were their set purpose to
forget Him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yet did not the chief butler
remember</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This was the most severe trial of
Joseph's patience, as we have before intimated. For since he had obtained an
advocate who, without trouble, was able to extricate him from prison, especially
as the opportunity of doing so had been granted to him by God, he felt a certain
assurance of deliverance, and earnestly waited for it every hour. But when he
had remained to the end of the second year in suspense, not only did this hope
vanish, but greater despair than ever rested upon his mind. Therefore, we are
all taught, in his person, that nothing is more improper, than to prescribe the
time in which God shall help us; since he purposely, for a long season, keeps
his own people in anxious suspense, that, by this very experiment, they may
truly know what it is to trust in Him. Besides, in this manner he designed
openly to claim for himself the glory of Joseph's liberation. For, if liberty
had been granted to him through the entreaty of the butler, it would have been
generally believed that this benefit was from man and not from God. Moreover,
when Moses says, that the butler was forgetful of Joseph, let it be so
understood, that he did not dare to make any mention of him, lest he should be
subjected to reproach, or should be troublesome to the king himself. For it is
common with courtiers perfidiously to betray the innocent, and to deliver them
to be slain, rather than to offend those of whom they themselves are
afraid.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">CHAPTER

What anxiety oppressed the mind of the holy man during this time, each of us may
conjecture from his own feeling; for we are so tender and effeminate, that we
can scarcely bear to be put off for a short time. The Lord exercised his servant
not only by a delay of long continuance, but also by another kind of temptation,
because he took all human grounds of hope away from him: therefore Moses puts
"years of days" for complete and full years. That we may better understand the
invincible nature of his fortitude, we must also notice that winding course of
divine providence, of which I have spoken, and by which Joseph was led about,
till he rose into notice with the king. In the king's dream, this is worthy to
be observed in the first place, that God sometimes deigns to present his oracles
even to unbelieving and profane men. It was certainly a singular honor to be
instructed concerning an event yet fourteen years future: for truly the will of
God was manifested to Pharaoh, just as if he had been taught by the word, except
that the interpretation of it was to be sought elsewhere. And although God
designs his word especially for the Church, yet it ought not to be deemed absurd
that he sometimes admits even aliens into his school, though for an inferior
end. The doctrine which leads to the hope of eternal life belongs to the Church;
while the children of this world are only taught, incidentally, concerning the
state of the present life. If we observe this distinction, we shall not wonder
that some oracles are common to profane and heathen men, though the Church
possesses the spiritual doctrine of life, as the treasure of its own
inheritance. That another dream succeeded to the former, arose from two causes;
for God both designed to rouse the mind of Pharaoh to more diligent inquiry, and
to add more light to a vision which was obscure. In short, he follows the same
course in this dream which he does in his daily method of procedure; for he
repeats a second time what he has before delivered, and sometimes inculcates
still more frequently, not only that the doctrine may penetrate more deeply into
men's hearts, and thus affect them the more; but also that he may render it more
familiar to their minds. That by the second dream God designed to illustrate
more fully what was obscure in the first, appears from this, that the figure
used was more appropriate to the subject revealed. At first, Pharaoh saw fat
cows devoured by lean ones. This did not so clearly prefigure the seven years'
abundance, and as many years of want in corn and other seeds, as the vision of
the ears of corn did: for the similitude, in the latter case, better agrees with
the thing represented.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the morning his spirit was
troubled</i></font><font face="Palatino">. A sting was left in Pharaoh's heart,
that he might know that he had to deal with God; for this anxiety was as an
inward seal of the Spirit of God, to give authenticity to the dream; although
Pharaoh deserved to be deprived of the advantage of this revelation, when he
resorted to magicians and soothsayers, who were wont to turn the truth of God
into a lie. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F608</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He was convinced by a secret impulse that the dream sent by God portended
something important; but he seeks out imposters, who would darken, by their
fallacies, the light which was divinely kindled; and it is the folly of the
human mind to gather to itself leaders and teachers of error. No doubt he
believed them to be true prophets; but because he voluntarily closes his eyes,
and hastens into the snare, his false opinion forms no sufficient excuse for
him; otherwise men, by merely shutting their eyes, might have some plausible
pretext for mocking God with impunity: and we see that many seek protection for
themselves in that gross ignorance in which they knowingly and purposely involve
themselves. Pharaoh, therefore, as far as he was able, deprived himself of the
benefit of the prophecy, by seeking for magicians as the interpreters of it. So
we see it daily happens that many lose hold of the truth, because they either
bring a cloud over themselves by their own indolence, or too eagerly catch at
false and spurious inventions. But because the Lord would, at that time, succor
the kingdom of Egypt, he drew Pharaoh back, as by main force, from his
error.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There was none that
could interpret</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By this remedy God provided
that the dream should not fail. We know what an inflated and impudent race of
men these soothsayers were, and how extravagantly they boasted. How did it then
happen that they gave the king no answer, seeing they might have trifled in any
way whatever with a credulous man, who willingly suffered himself to be deluded?
Therefore, that he might desist from inquiry, he is not allowed to find what he
had expected in his magicians: and the Lord so strikes dumb the wicked workers
of deceit, that they cannot even find a specious explanation of the dreams.
Moreover, by this method, the anxiety of the king is sharpened; because he
considers that what has escaped the sagacity of the magicians must be something
very serious and secret. By which example we are taught, that the Lord provides
the best for us, when he removes the incitements of error from those of us who
with to be deceived; and we must regard it as a singular favor, when either
false prophets are silenced, or their fatuity is, in any manner, discovered to
us. As for the rest, the king might hence easily gather how frivolous and
nugatory was the profession of wisdom, in which the Egyptians gloried above all
others; for they boasted that they were possessed of the science of divination
which ascended above the very heavens. But now, as far as they are concerned,
the king is without counsel, and, being disappointed of his hope, is filled with
anguish; nevertheless he does not so awake as to shake off his superstition.
Thus we see that men, though admonished, remain still in their torpor. Whence we
plainly perceive how inexcusable is the obstinacy of the world, which does not
desist from following those delusions which are openly condemned as foolishness,
from heaven.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then spake the chief
butler</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Although the Lord took pity on Egypt,
yet he did it not for the sake of the king, or of the country, but that Joseph
might, at length, be brought out of prison; and further, that, in the time of
famine, food might be supplied to the Church: for although the produce was
stored with no design beyond that of providing for the kingdom of Egypt; yet God
chiefly cared for his Church, which he esteemed more highly than ten worlds.
Therefore the butler, who had resolved to be silent respecting Joseph, is
constrained to speak for the liberation of the holy man. In saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I do remember my faults this
day</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he is understood by some as confessing the
fault of ingratitude, because he had not kept the promise he had given. But the
meaning is different; for he could not speak concerning his imprisonment,
without interposing a preface of this kind, through fear, lest suspicion should
enter into the mind of the king, that his servant thought himself injured; or,
should take offense, as if the butler had not been sensible of the benefit
conferred upon him. We know how sensitive are the minds of kings; and the
courtier had found this out by long experience: therefore he begins by
acknowledging that he had been justly cast into prison. Whence it follows that
he was indebted to the clemency of the king for restoration to his former
state.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then Pharaoh sent and called
Joseph</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We see in the person of a proud king,
as in a glass, what necessity can effect. They whose circumstances are happy and
prosperous will scarcely condescend to hear those whom they esteem true
prophets, still less will they listen to strangers. Wherefore it was necessary
that the obstinacy of Pharaoh should be first subdued, in order that he might
send for Joseph, and accept him as his master and instructor. The same kind of
preparation is also necessary even for the elect; because they never become
docile until the pride of the flesh is laid low. Whenever, therefore, we are
cast into grievous troubles, which keep us in perplexity and anxiety, let us
know that God, in this manner, is accomplishing his design of rendering us
obedient to himself. When Moses relates that Joseph, before he came into the
presence of the king, changed his garments, we may hence conjecture that his
clothing was mean. To the same point, what is added respecting his "shaving
himself," ought, in my opinion, to be referred: for since Egypt was a nations of
effeminate delicacy, it is probable that they, being studious of neatness and
elegance, rather nourished their hair than otherwise. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F609</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But as Joseph put off his squalid raiment, so, that he might have no remaining
cause of shame, he is shaved. Let us know, then, that the servant of God lay in
filth even to the day of his deliverance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Pharaoh said unto
Joseph</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We see that Pharaoh offers himself as a
disciple to Joseph, being persuaded, by the statement of the butler, that he is
a prophet of God. This is, indeed, a constrained humility; but it is expressly
recorded, in order that, when the opportunity of learning 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F610</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is afforded us, we may not refuse reverently to honor the gifts of the Spirit.
Now, though Joseph, in referring Pharaoh to God, seems to deny that he himself
is about to interpret the dream, yet his answer bears on a different point: for,
because he knew that he was conversing with a heathen addicted to superstitions,
he wishes, above all things, to ascribe to God the glory due to him; as if he
had said, I am able to do nothing in this matter, nor will I offer anything as
from myself; but God alone shall be the interpreter of his own secret. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F611</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Should any one object, that whenever God uses the agency of men, their office
ought to be referred to in connection with his command: that indeed I
acknowledge, but yet so that the whole glory may remain with God; according to
the saying of St. Paul,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"Neither is he that

Corinthians 3:7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, Joseph not only desires to imbue the mind
of Pharaoh with some relish for piety, but, by ascribing the gift of
interpreting dreams to God alone, confesses that he is destitute of it, until he
obtains it from God. Wherefore, let us also learn, from the example of holy
Joseph, to honor the grace of God even among unbelievers; and if they shut the
door against the entire and full doctrine of piety; we must, at least, endeavor
to instill some drops of it into their minds. Let us also reflect on this, that
nothing is less tolerable than for men to arrogate to themselves anything as
their own; for this is the first step of wisdom, to ascribe nothing to
ourselves; but modestly to confess, that whatever in us is worthy of praise,
flows only from the fountain of God's grace. It is especially worthy of notice,
that as the Spirit of understanding is given to any one from heaven, he will
become a proper and faithful interpreter of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God shall give Pharaoh an
answer of peace</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Joseph added this from the
kindly feeling of his heart; for he did not yet comprehend what the nature of
the oracle would be. Therefore he could not, in his character as a prophet,
promise a successful and desirable issue; but, as it was his duty sincerely to
deliver what he received from the Lord, however sad and severe it might prove;
so, on the other hand, this liberty presented no obstacle to his wishing a
joyful issue to the king. Therefore, what is here said to the king concerning
peace, is a prayer rather than a
prophecy.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In my
dream</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This whole narration does not need to be
explained, for Pharaoh only repeats what we have before considered, with the
addition, that the lean cows, having devoured the fat ones, were rendered
nothing better. Whereby God designed to testify, that the dearth would be so
great, that the people, instead of being nourished by the abundance of food
gathered together, would be famished, and drag on a miserable existence. Joseph,
in answering that the two dreams were one, simply means, that one and the same
thing was showed unto Pharaoh by two figures. But before he introduces his
interpretation, he maintains that this is not a merely vanishing dream, but a
divine oracle: for unless the vision had proceeded from God, it would have been
foolish to inquire anxiously what it portended. Pharaoh, therefore, does not
here labor in vain in inquiring into the counsel of God. The form of speaking,
however, requires to be noticed; because Joseph does not barely say that God
will declare beforehand what may happen from some other quarter, but what he
himself is about to do. We hence infer, that God does not indolently contemplate
the fortuitous issue of things, as most philosophers vainly talk; but that he
determines, at his own will, what shall happen. Wherefore, in predicting events,
he does not give a response from the tables of fate, as the poets feign
concerning their Apollo, whom they regard as a prophet of events which are not
in his own power, but declares that whatever shall happen will be his own work.
So Isaiah, that he may ascribe to God alone the glory due to him, attributes to
him, both the revealing of things future, and the government of ail his events,
by his own authority.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;234507&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
45:7.) For he cries aloud that God is neither deceived, nor deceives, like the
idols; and he declares that God alone is the author of good and evil;
understanding by <i>evil</i>, adversity. Wherefore, unless we would cast God
down from his throne, we must leave to him his power of action, as well as his
foreknowledge. And this passage is the more worthy of observation; because, in
all ages, many foolish persons have endeavored to rob God of half his glory, and
now (as I have said) the same figment pleases many philosophers; because they
think it absurd to ascribe to God whatever is done in the world: as if truly the
Scripture had in vain declared, that his "judgments are a great deep."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193607&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
36:7.) But while they would subject the works of God to the judgment of their
own brain, having rejected his word, they prefer giving credit to Plato
respecting celestial mysteries. "That God," they say, "has foreknowledge of all
things, does not involve the necessity of their occurrence:" as if, indeed, we
asserted, that bare prescience was the cause of things, instead of maintaining
the connection established by Moses, that God foreknows things that are future,
because he had determined to do them; but they ignorantly and perversely
separate the providence of God from his eternal counsel, and his continual
operation. Above all things, it is right to be fully persuaded that, whenever
the earth is barren, whether frost, or drought, or hail, or any other thing, may
be the cause of it, the whole result is directed by the counsel of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>32.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And for that the dream was
doubled</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Joseph does not mean to say, that what
God may have declared but once, is mutable: but he would prevent Pharaoh's
confidence respecting the event revealed, from being shaken. For since God
pronounces nothing but from his own fixed and steadfast purpose, it is enough
that he should have spoken once. But our dullness and inconstancy cause him to
repeat the same thing the more frequently, in order that what he has certainly
decreed, may be fixed in our hearts; otherwise, as our disposition is variable,
so, what we have once heard from his mouth, is tossed up and down by us, until
it entirely escapes our memory. Moreover, Joseph not only commemorates the
stability of the heavenly decree, but also declares that what God has determined
to do, is near at hand, lest Pharaoh himself should slumber in the confident
expectation of longer delay. For though we confess that the judgments of God are
always hanging over our heads, yet unless we are stimulated by the thought of
their speedy approach, we are but slightly affected with anxiety and fear
respecting them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>33.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now therefore let Pharaoh
look out a man</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Joseph does more than he had
been asked to do; for he is not merely the interpreter of the dream; but, as
fulfilling the office of a prophet, he adds instruction and counsel. For we know
that the true and lawful prophets of God do not barely predict what will happen
in future; but propose remedies for impending evils. Therefore Joseph, after he
had uttered a prophecy of the changes which would take place in fourteen years,
now teaches what ought to be done; and exhorts Pharaoh to be vigilant in the
discharge of this duty. And one of the marks by which God always distinguished
his own prophets from false prognosticators, was to endue them with the power of
teaching and exhorting, that they might not uselessly predict future events. Let
us grant that the predictions of Apollo, and of all the magicians were true, and
were not entangled with ambiguous expressions; yet whither did they tend, but
either to drive men headlong in perverse confidence, or to plunge them into
despair? A very different method of prophesying was divinely prescribed, which
would form men to piety, would lead them to repentance, and would excite them to
prayer when oppressed with fear. Moreover, because the prophecy of which mention
is here made, was published only for the temporal advantage of this fleeting
life, Joseph proceeds no further than to show the king for what purpose the
dream had been sent to him; as if he had said, "Be not sorry on account of this
revelation; accept this advantage from it, that thou mayest succor the poverty
of thy kingdom." However, there is no doubt that God guided his tongue, in order
that Pharaoh might entrust him with this office. For he does not craftily
insinuate himself into the king's favor; nor abuse the gift of revelation to his
private gain: but, what had been divinely ordained was brought to its proper
issue without his knowledge; namely, that the famishing house of Jacob should
find unexpected sustenance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>35.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Under the hand of
Pharaoh</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Whereas prosperity so intoxicates men,
that the greater part make no provision for themselves against the future, but
absorb the present abundance by intemperance; Joseph advises the king to take
care that the country may have its produce laid up in store. Besides, the common
people would also form themselves to habits of frugality, when they understood
that this great quantity of corn was not collected in vain by the king, but that
a remedy was hereby sought for some unwonted calamity. In short, because luxury
generally prevails in prosperity, and wastes the blessings of God, the bridle of
authority was necessary. This is the reason why Joseph directed that garners
should be established under the power of the king, and that corn should be
gathered into them. He concludes at length, that the dream was useful, although
at first sight, it would seem sad and inauspicious: because, immediately after
the wound had been shown, the means of cure were
suggested.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>38.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Can we find such a one as
this?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We see that necessity is an excellent
teacher. If prefects or judges are to be created, some one is advanced to the
honor because he is a favorite, without consideration of his desert; whence it
happens that they who are most unworthy frequently creep into office. And
although we see political order disturbed and mankind involved in many
inconveniences, because they who are least suitable, rashly push themselves, by
wicked contrivances, into affairs for which they are not able to manage;
nevertheless, ambition triumphs, and subverts equity. But necessity extorts a
sober judgment. Pharaoh says nothing but what is naturally engraven on the
hearts of all men, that honors ought to be conferred on none but competent
persons, and such as God has furnished with the necessary qualifications.
Experience, however, abundantly teaches, that this law of nature slips from the
memory, whenever men are free to offend against it with impunity. Therefore the
pride of Pharaoh was wisely so subdued, that he, setting aside ambition,
preferred a foreigner just brought out of prison, to all his courtiers, because
he excelled them in virtue. The same necessity restrained the nobles of the
kingdom, so that they did not each contend, according to their custom, to obtain
the priority of rank for themselves. And although it was but a compulsory
modesty, inasmuch as they were ashamed to resist the public good; yet there is
no doubt, that God inspired them with fear, so that, by the common consent of
all, Joseph was made president of the whole kingdom. It is also to be observed
that Pharaoh, though he had been infatuated by his soothsayers, nevertheless
honors the gifts of the spirit in Joseph: because God, indeed, never suffers man
to become so brutalized, as not to feel his power, even in their darkness. And
therefore whatever impious defection may hurry them away, there still abides
with them a remaining sense of Deity. Meanwhile, that knowledge is of little
worth, which does not correct a man's former madness; for he despises the God
whom with his mouth he proclaims: and has no conception of any other than I know
not what confused divinity. This kind of knowledge often enlightens profane men,
yet not so as to cause them to repent. Whereby we are admonished to regard any
particular principle as of small value, till solid piety springs from it and
flourishes.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>40.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt be over my
house</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Not only is Joseph made governor of
Egypt, but is adorned also with the insignia of royalty, that all may reverence
him, and may obey his command. The royal signet is put upon his finger for the
confirmation of decrees. He is clothed in robes of fine linen, which were then a
luxury, and were not to be had at any common price. He is placed in the most
honorable chariot. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F612</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It may, however, be asked, whether it was lawful for the holy man to appear with
so great pomp? I answer, although such splendor can scarcely ever be free from
blame, and therefore frugality in external ornaments is best; yet all kind of
splendor in kings and other princes of the world is not to be condemned,
provided they neither too earnestly desire it, nor make an ostentatious display
of it. Moderation is, indeed, always to be cultivated; but since it was not in
Joseph's power to prescribe the mode of investiture, and the royal authority
would not have been granted to him without the accustomed pomp of state, he was
at liberty to accept more than seemed in itself desirable. If the option be
given to the servants of God, nothing is safer for them, than to cut off
whatever they can of outward splendor. And where it is necessary for them to
accommodate themselves to public custom, they must beware of all ostentation and
vanity. With respect to the explanation of the words; whereas we render them,
"At thy mouth all the people shall <i>kiss</i>," 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F613</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
others prefer to read, "shall be <i>armed</i>;" others, "shall be fed at thy
will or commandment;" but as the proper signification of the verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">q&ccedil;n</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>nashak</i>) is to kiss, I do not see why interpreters should twist it to
another sense. Yet I do not think that here any special token of reverence is
intended; but the phrase rather seems to be metaphorical, to the effect that the
people should cordially receive and obediently embrace whatever might proceed
from the mouth of Joseph: as if Pharaoh had said, "Whatever he may command, it
is my will that the people shall receive with one consent, as if all should kiss
him." The second chariot, is read by the Hebrews in construction, for the
chariot of the viceroy, who holds the second place from the king. The sense,
however, is clear, that Joseph has the precedence of all the nobles of
Egypt.</font><br><font face="Palatino">There are various opinions about the
meaning of the word </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#176;rba
</font><font face="Palatino">(<i>abraik</i>). They who explain it by "tender
father," because Joseph, being yet in tender years, was endowed with the
prudence and gravity of old age, seem to me to bring something from afar to
correspond with their own fancy. They who render it "the father of the king," as
if the word were compounded of the Hebrew noun
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ba</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>ab</i>,) and the Arabic
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#176;r</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>rak</i>,) have little more color for their interpretation. If, indeed, the
word be Hebrew, the meaning preferred by others, "Bow the knee," seems to me
more probable. But because I rather suppose that Egyptian terms are referred to
by Moses, both in this place and shortly afterwards, I advise the readers not to
distort them in vain. And truly those interpreters are ridiculously subtle, who
suppose that a Hebrew name was given him by an Egyptian king, which they render
either the "Redeemer of the world," or the "Expounder of mysteries." 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F614</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
I prefer following the Greek interpreters, who, by leaving both words untouched,
sufficiently prove that they thought them to be of a foreign language. That the
father-in-law of Joseph was, as is commonly believed, a <i>priest</i>, is what I
cannot refute, though I can scarcely be induced to believe it. Therefore, since
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;hwk</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>cohen</i>) signifies a <i>prince</i> as well as a <i>priest</i>, it seems to
me probable that he was one of the nobles of the court, who might also be the
satrap or prefect of the city of On. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F615</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>46.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joseph was thirty years
old</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For two reasons Moses records the age at
which Joseph was advanced to the government of the kingdom. First, because it is
seldom that old men give themselves up to be governed by the young: whence it
may be inferred that it was by the singular providence of God that Joseph
governed without being envied, and that reverence and majesty were given him
beyond his years. For if there was danger lest Timothy's youth should render him
contemptible, Joseph would have been equally exposed to contempt, unless
authority had been divinely procured for him. And although he could not have
obtained this authority by his own industry, yet it is probable that the
extraordinary virtues with which God had endowed him, availed not a little to
increase and confirm it. A second reason for noting his age is, that the reader
may reflect on the long duration of the sufferings with which he had been, in
various ways, afflicted. And however humane his treatment might have been;
still, thirteen years of exile, which had prevented his return to his father's
house, not merely by the bond of servitude, but also by imprisonment, would
prove a most grievous trial. Therefore, it was only after he had been proved by
long endurance, that he was advanced to a better state. Moses then subjoins,
that he discharged his duties with diligence and with most punctual fidelity;
for the circuit taken by him, which is here mentioned, was a proof of no common
industry. He might, indeed, have appointed messengers, on whose shoulders he
could have laid the greater part of the labor and trouble; but because he knew
himself to be divinely called to the work, as one who had to render an account
to the divine tribunal, he refused no part of the burden. And Moses, in a few
words, praises his incredible prudence, in having quickly found out the best
method of preserving the corn. For it was an arduous task to erect storehouses
in every city, which should contain the entire produce of one year, and a fifth
part more. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F616</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This arrangement was also not less a proof of sagacity, in providing that the
inhabitants of any given region should not have to seek food at a distance.
Immediately afterwards his integrity is mentioned, which was equally deserving
of praise; because in the immense accumulation which was made, he abstained from
all self-indulgence, just as if some humble office only, had been assigned to
him. But it is to the praise of both these virtues that, after he has collected
immense heaps, he remits nothing of his wonted diligence, until he has
accomplished all the duties of the office which he had undertaken. The ancient
proverb says, "Satiety produces disgust," and in the same manner abundance is
commonly the mother of idleness. Whence, therefore, is it, that the diligence of
Joseph holds on its even course, and does not become remiss at the sight of
present abundance, except because he prudently considers, that, however great
the plenty might be, seven years of famine would swallow it all up? He
manifested also his fidelity, and his extraordinary care for the public safety,
in this, that he did not become weary by the assiduous labor of seven years, nor
did he ever rest till he had made provision for the seven years which still
remained.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>50.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And unto Joseph were born two
sons</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Although the names which Joseph gave his
sons in consequence of the issue of his affairs, breathe somewhat of piety,
because in them he celebrates the kindness of God: yet the oblivion of his
father's house, which, he says, had been brought upon him, can scarcely be
altogether excused. It was a pious and holy motive to gratitude, that God had
caused him to "forget" all his former miseries; but no honor ought to have been
so highly valued, as to displace from his mind the desire and the remembrance of
his father's house. Granted that he is Viceroy of Egypt, yet his condition is
unhappy, as long as he is an exile from the Church. Some, in order to exculpate
the holy man, explain the passage as meaning that he so rejoiced in the present
favor of God, as to make him afterwards forgetful of the injuries inflicted upon
him by his brethren; but this (in my judgment) is far too forced. And truly, we
must not anxiously labor to excuse the sin of Joseph; but rather, I think, we
are admonished how greatly we ought to be on our guard against the attractions
of the world, lest our minds should be unduly gratified by them. Behold Joseph,
although he purely worships God, is yet so captivated by the sweetness of honor,
and has his mind so clouded, that he becomes indifferent to his father's house,
and pleases himself in Egypt. But this was almost to wander from the fold of
God. It was, indeed, a becoming modesty, that from a desire of proclaiming the
Divine goodness towards him, he was not ashamed to perpetuate a memorial of his
depressed condition in the names of his sons. They who are raised on high, from
an obscure and ignoble position, desire to extinguish the knowledge of their
origin, because they deem it disgraceful to themselves. Joseph, however,
regarded the commendation of Divine grace more highly than an ostentatious
future nobility.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>53.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the seven years ... were
ended</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Already the former unwonted fertility,
which showed Joseph to have been a true prophet, had procured for him a name and
reputation; and in this way the Egyptians had been restrained from raising any
tumult against him. Nevertheless, it is wonderful that a people so proud should
have borne, in the time of prosperity, the rule of a foreigner. But the famine
which followed proved a more sharp and severe curb for the subjugation of their
lofty and ferocious spirits, in order that they might be brought into subjection
to authority. When, however, Moses says that there was corn in all the land of
Egypt, while the neighboring regions were suffering from hunger, he seems to
intimate that wheat had also been laid up by private persons. And, indeed, (as
we have said elsewhere,) it was impossible but the rumor of the approaching
famine would be spread abroad, and would everywhere infuse fears and solicitude,
so that each person would make some provision for himself. Nevertheless, however
provident each might be, what they had preserved would, in a short time, be
consumed. Whence it appeared with what skill and prudence Joseph had perceived
from the beginning, that Egypt would not be safe, unless provisions were
publicly gathered together under the hand of the
king.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>55.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go unto
Joseph</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is by no means unusual for kings,
while their subjects are oppressed by extreme sufferings, to give themselves up
to pleasures. But Moses here means something else; for Pharaoh does not
exonerate himself from the trouble of distributing corn, because he wishes to
enjoy a repose free from all inconvenience; but because he hassuch confidence in
holy Joseph, that he willingly leaves all things to him, and does not allow him

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now when Jacob
saw</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses begins, in this chapter, to treat of
the occasion which drew Jacob with his whole family into Egypt; and thus leaves
it to us to consider by what hidden and unexpected methods God may perform
whatever he has decreed. Though, therefore, the providence of God is in itself a
labyrinth; yet when we connect the issue of things with their beginnings, that
admirable method of operation shines clearly in our view, which is not generally
acknowledged, only because it is far removed from our observation. Also our own
indolence hinders us from perceiving God, with the eyes of faith, as holding the
government of the world; because we either imagine fortune to be the mistress of
events, or else, adhering to near and natural causes, we weave them together,
and spread them as veils before our eyes. Whereas, therefore, scarcely any more
illustrious representation of Divine Providence is to be found than this history
furnishes; let pious readers careful)y exercise themselves in meditation upon
it, in order that they may acknowledge those things which, in appearance, are
fortuitous, to be directed by the hand of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why do ye look one upon
another?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Why do ye Men are said to look one
upon another, when each is waiting for the other, and, for want of counsel, no
one dares to attempt anything. Jacob, therefore, censures this inactivity of his
sons, because none of them endeavors to provide for the present necessity. Moses
also says that they went into Egypt at the command of their father, and even
without Benjamin; by which he intimates that filial reverence at that time was
great; because envy of their brother did not prevent them from leaving their
wives and children, and undertaking a long journey. He also adds, that they came
in the midst of a great crowd of people; which enhances the fame of Joseph; who,
while supplying food for all Egypt, and dispensing it by measure, till the end
of the drought, could also afford assistance to neighboring
nations.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joseph was the
governor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> 
</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon"><i>F617</i></font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
over the land</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses connects the honor of
Joseph with his fidelity and diligence. For although he was possessed of supreme
authority, he nevertheless submitted to every possible laborious service, just
as if he had been a hired servant. From which example we must learn, that as any
one excels in honor, he is bound to be the more fully occupied in business; but
that they who desire to combine leisure with dignity, utterly pervert the sacred
order of God. Let it be, moreover, understood, that the corn was sold by Joseph,
not as if he measured it out with his own hands, or himself received the money
for it, seeing that it was set to sale in many parts of the kingdom, and he
could scarcely have attended to one single storehouse: but that the whole of the
stores were under his power.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He made himself strange unto
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It may be asked for what purpose Joseph
thus tormented his brethren with threats and with terror. For if he was actuated
by a sense of the injury received from them, he cannot be acquitted of the
desire of revenge. It is, however, probable, that he was impelled neither by
anger nor a thirst of vengeance, but that he was induced by two just causes to
act as he did. For he both desired to regain his brother Benjamin, and wished to
ascertain, &#8212; as if by putting them to the torture, &#8212; what was in
their mind, whether they repented or not; and, in short, what had been their
course of life since he had seen them last. For, had he made himself known at
the first interview, it was to be feared lest they, keeping their father out of
sight, and wishing to cast a vail over the detestable wickedness which they had
committed, should only increase it by a new crime. There lurked, also, a not
unreasonable suspicion concerning his brother Benjamin, lest they should attempt
something perfidious and cruel against him. It was therefore important that they
should be more thoroughly sifted; so that Joseph, being fully informed of the
state of his father's house, might take his measures according to circumstances;
and also, that previous to pardon, some punishment might be inflicted which
would lead them more carefully to reflect upon the atrocity of their crime. For
whereas he afterwards showed himself to be placable and humane; this did not
arise from the fact, that his anger being assuaged, he became, by degrees,
inclined to compassion; but rather, as Moses elsewhere subjoins, that he sought
retirement, because he could no longer refrain himself; herein intimating at the
same time, that Joseph had <i>forcibly</i> repressed his tears so long as he
retained a severe aspect; and, therefore, that he had felt throughout the same
affection of pity towards them. And it appears that a special impulse moved him
to this whole course of action. For it was no common thing, that Joseph,
beholding so many authors of his calamities, was neither angry nor changed in
his manner, nor broke out into reproaches; but was composed both in his
countenance and his speech, as if he had long meditated at leisure, respecting
the course he would pursue. But it may be inquired again, whether his
dissimulation, which was joined with a falsehood, is not to be blamed; for we
know how pleasing integrity is to God, and how strictly he prohibits his own
people from deceit and falsehoods. Whether God governed his servant by some
special movement, to depart without fault, from the common rule of action, I
know not; seeing that the faithful may sometimes piously do things which cannot
lawfully be drawn into a precedent. Of this, however, in considering the acts of
the holy fathers, we must always beware; lest they should lead us away from that
law which the Lord prescribes to all in common. By the general command of God,
we must all cultivate sincerity. That Joseph feigned something different from
the truth, affords no pretext to excuse us if we attempt anything of the same
kind. For, though a liberty granted by privilege would be pardoned, yet if any
one, relying on a private example, does not scruple to subvert the law of God,
so as to give himself license to do what is therein forbidden, he shall justly
suffer the punishment of his audacity. And yet I do not think that we ought to
be very anxious to excuse Joseph, because it is probable that he suffered
something from human infirmity, which God forgave him; for by Divine mercy alone
could that dissimulation, which in itself was not without fault, escape
condemnation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joseph remembered the
dreams</i></font><font face="Palatino">. When the boy Joseph had spoken of
receiving obeisance, the absurdity of the thing impelled his brethren wickedly
to devise his death. Now, although they bow down to him without knowing him,
there is yet nothing better for them. Indeed, their only means of safety, is to
prostrate themselves at his feet, and to be received by him as suppliants.
Meanwhile, their conspiracy, by which they attempted to subvert the celestial
decree, lest they should have to bear the yoke, was rendered fruitless. So the
Lord forcibly restrains the obstinate, just as wild and refractory horses are
wont to be more severely treated, the more they kick and are restive. Wherefore,
there is nothing better than meekly to compose the mind to gentleness, that each
may take his own lot contentedly, though it be not very splendid. It may,
however, seem absurd, that Joseph should, at this time, have recalled his dream
to mind, as if it had been forgotten through the lapse of years; which, indeed,
could not be, unless he had lost sight of the promises of God. I answer, nothing
is here recorded but what frequently happens to ourselves: for although the word
of God may be dwelling in our hearts, yet it does not continually occur to us,
but rather is sometimes so smothered that it may seem to be extinct, especially
when faith is oppressed by the darkness of affliction. Besides, it is nothing
wonderful, if a long series of evils should have buried, in a kind of oblivion,
his dreams which indicated prosperity. God had exalted him, by these dreams, to
the hope of great and distinguished authority. He is, however, cast into a well
not unlike a grave. He is taken hence to be sold as a slave; he is carried to a
distant land; and, as if slavery would not prove sufficiently severe, he is shut
up in prison. And though his misery is in some degree mitigated, when he is
released from his iron fetters, yet there was little, if any, prospect of
deliverance. I do not, however, think that the hope entertained by him was
entirely destroyed, but that a cloud passed over it, which deprived him of the
light of comfort. A different kind of temptation followed; because nothing is
more common than for great and unexpected felicity to intoxicate its possessors.
And thus it happened, as we have recently read, that a forgetfulness of his
father's house stole over the mind of the holy man. He was not, therefore, so
mindful of his dreams as he ought to have been. Another excuse may probably be
alleged; that he, at the moment, compared his dreams with the event. And truly
it was no common virtue to apply what was passing, thus immediately for the
confirmation of the Divine oracle. For we readily perceive, that those dreams
which so quickly recur to the memory, had not been obliterated through length of
time. So the disciples remembered the words of the Lord after he had risen from
the dead; because, by the sight of the fact predicted, their knowledge became
more clear; whereas, before, nothing but transient sparks of it had shined in
their hearts.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By the life of
Pharaoh</i></font><font face="Palatino">. From this formula of swearing a new
question is raised; for that which is commanded in the law, that we should swear
only by the name of God, had already been engraven on the hearts of the pious;
since nature dictates that this honor is to be given to God alone, that men
should defer to his judgment, and should make him the supreme arbiter and
vindicator of faith and truth. If we should say that this was not simply an
oath, but a kind of obtestation, the holy man will be, in some degree,
excusable. He who swears by God wishes him to interpose in order to inflict
punishment on perjury. They who swear by their life or by their hand, deposit,
as it were, what they deem most valuable, as a pledge of their faithfulness. By
this method the majesty of God is not transferred to mortal man; because it is a
very different thing to cite him as witness who has the right of taking
vengeance, and to assert by something most dear to us, that what we say is true.
So Moses, when he calls heaven and earth to witness, does not ascribe deity to
them, and thus fabricate a new idol; but, in order that higher authority may be
given to the law, he declares that there is no part of the world which will not
cry out before the tribunal of God, against the ingratitude of the people, if
they reject the doctrine of salvation. Notwithstanding, there is, I confess, in
this form of swearing which Joseph uses, something deserving of censure; for it
was a profane adulation, among the Egyptians, to swear by the life of the king.
Just as the Romans swore by the genius of their prince, after they had been
reduced to such bondage that they made their Caesar equal to gods. Certainly
this mode of swearing is abhorrent to true piety. Whence it may be perceived
that nothing is more difficult to the holy servants of God than to keep
themselves so pure, while conversant with the filth of the world, as to contract
no spots of defilement from it. Joseph, indeed, was never so infected with the
corruptions of the court, but that he remained a pure worshipped of God:
nevertheless we see, that in accommodating himself to this depraved custom of
speaking, he had received some stain. His repetition of the expression shows,
that when any one has once become accustomed to evil, he becomes exceedingly
prone to sin again and again. We observe, that they who have once rashly assumed
the license of swearing, pour forth an oath every third word, even when speaking
of the most frivolous things. So much the greater caution ought we to use, lest
any such indulgence should harden us in this wicked
custom.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he put them altogether
into ward</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here, not by words only, as before,
but by the act itself, Joseph shows himself severe towards his brethren, when he
shuts them all up in prison, as if about to bring them to punishment: and during
three days torments them with fear. We said a little while ago, that from this
act no rule for acting severely and rigidly is to be drawn; because it is
doubtful whether he acted rightly or otherwise. Again, it is to be feared lest
they who plead his example should be far removed from his mildness, and that
they should prove to be rather his apes than his true imitators. Meanwhile, it
plainly appears what he was aiming at; for he does not mitigate their
punishment, as if at the end of three days he was appeased; but he renders them
more anxious about the redemption of their brother, whom he retains as a
hostage. Lest, however, immoderate fear should deter them from returning, he
promises to act with good faith towards them: and to convince them of that, he
declares that he fears God, which expression is worthy of observation. Doubtless
he speaks from the inward feeling of his heart, when he declares that he will
deal well and truly with them, because he fears God. Therefore the commencement
and the fountain of that good and honest conscience, whereby we cultivate
fidelity and justice towards men, is the fear of God. There appears indeed some
probity in the despisers of God; but it soon goes off in smoke, unless the
depraved affections of the flesh are restrained as with a bridle, by the thought
that God is to be feared, because he will be the Judge of the world. For whoever
does not think that he must render an account, will never so cultivate integrity
as to refrain from pursuing what he supposes will be useful to himself.
Wherefore, if we wish to be free from perfidy, craft, cruelty, and all wicked
desire of doing injure, we must labor earnestly that religion may flourish among
us. For whenever we act with want of sincerity or humanity towards each other,
impiety openly betrays itself. For whatever there is of rectitude or justice in
the world, Joseph comprised in this short sentence, when he said, that he feared
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they said one to
another</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is a remarkable passage, showing
that the sons of Jacob, when reduced to the greatest straits, recall to memory a
fratricide committed thirteen years previously. Before affliction pressed upon
them, they were in a state of torpor. Moses relates that, even lately, they had
spoken without agitation of Joseph's death, as if conscious to themselves of no
evil. But now they are compelled (so to speak) to enter into their own
consciences. We see then, how in adversity, God searches and tries men; and how,
while dissipating all their flattering illusions, he not only pierces their
minds with secret fear, but extorts a confession which they would gladly avoid.
And this kind of examination is very necessary for us. Wonderful is the
hypocrisy of men in covering their evils; and if impunity be allowed, their
negligence will be increased twofold. Wherefore no remedy remains, except that
they who give themselves up to slumber when the Lord deals gently with them,
should be awakened by afflictions and punishments. Joseph therefore produced
some good effect, when he extorted from his brethren the acknowledgment of their
sin, in which they had securely pleased themselves. And the Lord had compassion
on them, in taking away the covering with which they had been too long deceived.
In the same manner, while he daily chastises us by the hand of man, he draws us,
as guilty, to his tribunal. Nevertheless it would profit but little to be tried
by adversity, unless he inwardly touched the heart; for we see how few reflect
on their sins, although admonished by most severe punishments; certainly no one
comes to this state of mind but with reluctance. Wherefore, there is no doubt
that God, in order to lead the sons of Jacob to repentance, impelled them, as
well by the secret instinct of his Spirit as by outward chastisement, to become
sensible of that sin which had been too long concealed. Let the reader also
observe, that the sons of Jacob did not only fix their minds on something which
was close at hand, but considered that divine punishments were inflicted in
various ways upon sinners. And doubtless, in order to apprehend the divine
judgments, we must extend our views afar. Sometimes indeed God, by inflicting
present punishment on sinners, holds them up for observation as on a theater;
but often, as if aiming at another object, he takes vengeance on our sins
unexpectedly, and from an unseen quarter. If the sons of Jacob had merely looked
for some present cause of their sufferings, they could have done nothing but
loudly complain that they had been injured; and at length despair would have
followed. But while considering how far and wide the providence of God extends,
looking beyond the occasion immediately before their eyes, they ascend to a
remote cause. It is, however, doubtful, whether they say that they shall be
<i>held guilty</i> on account of their brother, or for their brother's sake, or
that they will themselves <i>confess</i> that they have sinned: for the Hebrew
noun,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ym&ccedil;a</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>ashaimim</i>) is ambiguous because it sometimes refers to the crime
committed, and sometimes to the punishment, as in Latin, piaculum signifies both
the crime and the expiation. On the whole, it is of little consequence which
meaning is preferred, for they acknowledge their sin either in its guilt or its
punishment. But the latter sense appears to me the more simple and genuine, that
they are deservedly punished because they had been so cruel to their
brother.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that we saw the
anguish of his soul</i></font><font face="Palatino">. They acknowledge that it
is by the just judgment of God, that they obtained nothing by their suppliant
entreaties, because they themselves had acted so cruelly towards their brother.
Christ had not yet uttered the sentence,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"With what measure ye
mete, it shall be measured unto you again,"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;400702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
7:2,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">but it was a dictate of nature, that they who had
been cruel to others, were unworthy of commiseration. The more heed ought we to
take, that we prove not deaf to so many threatening of Scripture. Dreadful is
that denunciation,</font><br></div>

21:13.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore while we have time, let us learn to
exercise humanity, to sympathize with the miserable, and to stretch out our hand
for the sake of giving assistance. But if at any time it happens that we are
treated roughly by men, and our prayers are proudly rejected; then, at least,
let the question occur to us, whether we ourselves have in anything acted
unkindly towards others; for although it were better to be wise beforehand; it
is, nevertheless, some advantage, whenever others proudly despise us, to reflect
whether they with whom we have had to deal, have not experienced similar
hardships from us. "Our brother," they say, "entreated us when he was in the
last extremity: we rejected his prayers: therefore it is by divine retribution
that we can obtain nothing." By these words they bear witness that the hearts of
men are so under Divine government, that they can be inclined to equity, or
hardened in inflexible rigor. Moreover, their cruelty was hateful to God,
because, since his goodness is diffused through heaven and earth, and his
beneficence is extended not only to men, but even to brute animals, nothing is
more contrary to his nature, than that we should cruelly reject those who
implore our protection.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Reuben answered
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Because he had attempted to deliver
Joseph out of the hands of his brethren, in order to restore him in safety to
his father, he magnifies their fault, in not having, at that time, listened to
any prudent counsel: and I understand his words as conveying a reproof for their
too late repentance. Whereas Joseph was not yet satisfied with this confession,
but retained Simeon in bonds, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F618</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and dismissed the rest in suspense and perplexity, this was not done from
malevolence, but because he was not certain about the safety of his brother
Benjamin, and the state of his father's house. For he might justly fear lest,
when they found that their wicked contrivance of putting their brother to death,
was discovered, they might again attempt some horrible crime, as desperate men
are wont to do; or, at least, might desert their father, and flee to some other
country. Nevertheless the act of Joseph is not to be drawn into a precedent:
because it is not always right to be thus austere. We ought also to beware lest
the offender be swallowed up by grief, if we are not mild, and disposed to
forgiveness. Therefore we must seek the spirit of discretion from heaven, which
shall so govern us that we may do nothing by rash impetuosity, or immoderate
severity. This, indeed, is to be remembered, that under the stern countenance of
Joseph was concealed not only a mild and placid disposition, but the most tender
affection.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And as one of them opened his
sack</i></font><font face="Palatino">. With what intention Joseph had commanded
the price paid for the corn to be secretly deposited in the sacks of his
brethren, may easily be conjectured; for he feared lest his father being already
impoverished, would not be able again to buy provisions. The brethren, having
found their money, knew not where to seek the cause; except that, being
terrified, they perceived that the hand of God was against them. That they were
greatly astonished appears from their not voluntarily returning to Joseph, in
order to prove their own innocence: for the remedy of the evil was at hand, if
they had not been utterly blinded. Wherefore we must ask God to supply us, in
doubtful and troubled affairs, not only with fortitude, but also with prudence.
We see also how little can be effected even by a great multitude, unless the
Lord preside among them. The sons of Jacob ought mutually to have exhorted each
other, and to have consulted together what was necessary to be done: but there
is an end to all deliberation; no solace nor remedy is suggested. Even while
each sees the rest agitated, they mutually increase each other's trepidation.
Therefore, the society and countenance of men will profit us nothing, unless the
Lord strengthen us from heaven.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What is this that God has
done unto us?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> They do not expostulate with God,
as if they thought this danger had come upon them without cause: but, perceiving
that God was angry with them in many ways, they deplore their wretchedness. But
why do they not rather turn their thoughts to Joseph? For the suspicion was
natural, that this had been done by fraud, because he wished to lay new snares
for them. How does it happen, then, that losing sight of man, they set God as an
avenger directly before them? Truly, because this single thought possessed their
minds, that a just reward, and such as their sins deserved, would be given them;
and, from that time, they referred whatever evils happened to the same cause.
Before (as we have said) they were asleep: but from the time that they began to
be affected by the lively fear of God's judgment, his providence always
presented itself to their view. So David, when, by the inward suggestion of the
Spirit, he has learned that the rod with which he was chastised had been sent
from heaven, is not distracted or perplexed, though he sees plainly that the
evils have proceeded from another quarter; but prays to God to heal the wounds
which He had made. It is no common act of prudence, and is at the same time
profitable, whenever any adversity overtakes us, to accustom ourselves to the
consideration of the judgments of God. We see how unbelievers, while they
imagine their misfortunes to be accidental, or while they are bent on accusing
their enemies, only exasperate their grief by fretting and raging, and thus
cause the anger of God to burn the more against them. But he who, in his
affliction, exercises himself in reflecting on his own sins, and sets God before
him as his Judge, will humble himself in the divine presence, and will compose
his mind to patience by the hope of pardon. Let us, however, remember that the
providence of God is not truly acknowledged, except in connection with his
justice. Forthough the men by whose hand he chastises us are often unjust, yet,
in an incomprehensible manner, he executes his judgments through them, against
which judgments it is not lawful for us either to reply or to murmur. For
sometimes even the reprobate, though they acknowledge themselves to be stricken
by the hand of God, yet do not cease to complain against him, as Moses teaches
us by the example of Cain. I do not, however, understand that this complaint was
made by the sons of Jacob, for the purpose of charging God with tyrannical
violence; but because they, being overcome with fear, inferred from this double
punishment that God was highly displeased with
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they came unto Jacob
their father</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here is a long repetition of the
former history, but it is not superfluous; because Moses wished to show how
anxiously they made their excuse to their father for having left Simon in
chains, and how strenuously they pleaded with him, that, for the sake of
obtaining Simeon's liberty, he should allow them to take their brother Benjamin:
for this was greatly to the purpose. We know what a sharp dart is hunger: and
yet, though the only method of relieving their want was to fetch corn out of
Egypt, Jacob would rather that he and his family should perish, than allow
Benjamin to accompany the rest. What can he mean by thus peremptorily refusing
what his sons were compelled by necessity to ask, except to show that he was
suspicious of them? This also more clearly appears from his own words, when he
imputes his bereavement to them. For, though their declaration, that Joseph had
been torn by a wild beast, had some color of probability, there still remained
in the heart of the holy patriarch a secret wound, arising from suspicion;
because he was fully aware of their fierce and cruel hatred of the innocent
youth. Moreover, it is useful for us to know this; for it appears hence how
miserable was the condition of the holy man, whose mind, during thirteen
successive years, had been tortured with dire anxiety. Besides, his very silence
added greatly to his torment, because he was compelled to conceal the grief he
felt. But the chief burden of the evil was the temptation which oppressed him,
that the promise of God might prove illusory and vain. For he had no hope except
from the promised seed; but he seemed to be bringing up devils at home, from
whom a blessing was no more to be expected than life from death. He thought
Joseph to be dead, Benjamin alone remained to him uncorrupted: how could the
salvation of the world proceed from such a vicious offspring? He must,
therefore, have been endowed with great constancy, seeing he did not cease to
rely upon God; and being certainly persuaded that he cherished in his house the
Church, of which scarcely any appearance was left, he bore with his sons till
they should repent. Let the faithful now apply this example to themselves, lest
their minds should give way at the horrible devastation which is almost
everywhere perceived.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>35.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As they emptied their
sacks.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here, again, it appears how greatly they
had been alarmed in their journey, seeing that each had not at least examined
his sack, after money had been found in one. But these things are written to
show that, as soon as men are smitten with fear, they have no particle of wisdom
and of soundness of mind, until God tranquilizes them. Moreover, Joseph did not
act with sufficient consideration, in that he occasioned very great grief to his
father, whose poverty he really intended to relieve. Whence we learn that even
the most prudent are not always so careful, but that something may flow from
their acts which they do not wish.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>36.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Me have ye
bereaved</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Jacob does not, indeed, openly accuse
his sons of the crime of their brother's murder; yet he is angry as if, two of
his sons being already taken away, they were hastening to destroy the third. For
he says that all these evils were falling on himself alone; because he does not
think that they were affected as they ought to be, nor shared his grief with
him, but were carelessly making light of the destruction of their brethren, as
if they had no interest in their lives. It seems, however, exceedingly barbarous
that Reuben should offer his two sons to his father to be slain, if he did not
bring Benjamin back. Jacob might, indeed, slay his own grandchildren: what
comfort, then, could he take in acting cruelly to his own bowels? But this is
what I before alluded to, that they were suspected of having dealt perfidiously
towards Joseph; for which reason Reuben deemed it necessary to assuage his
father's fear, by such a vehement protestation; and to give this pledge, that he
and his brethren were designing nothing wicked against
Benjamin.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>38.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My son shall not go down with
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Again we see, as in a lively picture, with
what sorrow holy Jacob had been oppressed. He sees his whole family famishing:
he would rather be torn away from life than from his son: whence we gather that
he was not iron-hearted: but his patience is the more deserving of praise,
because he contended with the infirmity of the flesh, and did not sink under it.
And although Moses does not give a rhetorical amplification to his language, we
nevertheless easily perceive that he was overcome with excessive grief, when he
thus complained to his sons, You are too cruel to your father, in taking away
from me a third son, after I have been plundered of first one and then
another.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">CHAPTER

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the famine was sore in the
land</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In this chapter is recorded the second
journey of the sons of Jacob into Egypt, when the former supply of provision had
been exhausted. It may, however, here be asked, how Jacob could have supported
his family, even for a few days, with so small a quantity of corn: for, suppose
it to be granted that several asses were conducted by each of the brethren, what
was this to sustain three hundred persons? 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F619</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For, since Abraham had a much larger number of servants, and mention has been
made above of the servants of Isaac; it is incredible that Jacob was so entirely
destitute, as to have no servants left. If we say, that he, being a stranger,
had been compelled to sell them all, it is but an uncertain guess. It seems to
me more probable that they lived on acorns, herbs, and roots. For we know that
the orientals, especially when any necessity urges, are content with slender and
dry food, and we shall see presently, that, in this scarcity of wheat, there was
a supply of other food. I suppose, therefore, that no more corn had been bought
than would suffice to furnish a frugal and restricted measure of food for Jacob
himself, and for his children and grandchildren: and that the food of the
servants was otherwise provided for. There is, indeed, no doubt that the whole
region had been compelled to resort to acorns, and fruits of this kind, for food
for the servants, and that wheaten bread was a luxury belonging to the rich.
This was, indeed, a severe trial, that holy Jacob, of whom God had engaged to
take care, should almost perish, with his family, through hunger, and that the
land of which he was constituted the lord, in order that he might there happily
enjoy the abundance of all things, should even deny him bread as a stranger. For
he might seriously doubt what was the meaning of that remarkable promise, I am
God Almighty, grow and multiply: I will bless thee. It is profitable for us to
know these conflicts of the holy fathers, that, fighting with the same arms with
which they conquered, we also may stand invincible, although God should withhold
present help.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Judah spake unto him,
saying</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Judah seems to feign something, for the
purpose of extorting from his father what he knew he would not freely grant; but
it is probable that many discourses had been held on both sides, which Moses,
according to his custom, has not related. And since Joseph so ardently desired
the sight of his brother Benjamin, it is not surprising that he should have
labored, in every possible way, to obtain it. It may also have happened that he
had caused some notification or legal summons to be served, by which his brother
was cited to make his appearance, as in judicial causes. This however deserves
to be noticed, that Moses relates the long disputation which Jacob had with his
sons, in order that we may know with what difficulty he allowed his son Benjamin
to be torn away from him. For, though hunger was pressing, he nevertheless
contended for retaining him, just as if he were striving for the salvation of
his whole family. Whence, again, we may conjecture, that he suspected his sons
of a wicked conspiracy; and on this account Judah offers himself as a surety.
For he does not promise anything respecting the event, but only, for the sake of
clearing himself and his brethren, he takes Benjamin under his care, with this
condition, that if any injury should be done to Benjamin, he would bear the
punishment and the blame. From the example of Jacob let us learn patient
endurance, should the Lord often compel us, by pressure of circumstances, to do
many things contrary to the inclination of our own minds; for Jacob sends away
his son, as if he were delivering him over unto
death.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take of the best
fruits</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F620</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Though the fruits which Moses enumerates were, for the most part, not very
precious, because the condition of holy Jacob was not such that he could send
any royal present; yet, according to his slender ability, he wished to appease
Joseph. Besides we know that fruits are not always estimated according to their
cost. And now, having commanded his sons to do what he thought necessary, he has
recourse to prayer, that God would give them favor with the governor of Egypt.
We must attend to both these points whenever we are perplexed in any business;
for we must not omit any of those things which are expedient, or which may seem
to be of use; and yet we must place our reliance upon God. For the tranquillity
of faith has no affinity with indolence: but he who expects a prosperous issue
of his affairs from the Lord, will, at the same time, look closely to the means
which are in his power, and will apply them to present use. Meanwhile, let the
faithful observe this moderation, that when they have tried all means, they
still ascribe nothing to their own industry. At the same time, let them be
certainly convinced that all their endeavors will be in vain, unless the Lord
bless them. It is to be observed, also, in the form of his supplication, that
Jacob regards the hearts of men as subject to the will of God. When we have to
deal with men, we too often neglect to look unto the Lord, because we do not
sufficiently acknowledge him as the secret governor of their hearts. But to
whatever extent unruly men may be carried away by violence, it is yet certain
that their passions are turned by God in whatever direction he pleases, so that
he can mitigate their ferocity as often as he sees good; or can permit those to
become cruel, who before were disposed to mildness. So Jacob, although his sons
had found an austere severity in Joseph, yet trusts that his heart will be so in
the hand of God, that it shall be suddenly mounded to humanity. Therefore, as we
must hope in the Lord, when men deal unjustly with us, and must pray that they
may be changed for the better; so, on the other hand, we must remember that,
when they act with severity towards us, it is not done without the counsel of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If I be
bereaved</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Jacob may seem here to be hardly
consistent with himself; for, if the prayer which Moses has just related, was
the effect of faith, he ought to have been more calm; and, at least, to have
given occasion to the manifestation of the grace of God. But he appears to cut
himself off from every ground of confidence, when he supposes that nothing is
left for him but bereavement. It is like the speech of a man in despair, "I
shall remain bereaved as I am." As if truly he had prayed in vain; or had
feignedly professed that the remedy was in the hand of God. If, however, we
observe to whom his speech was directed, the solution is easy. It is by no means
doubtful that he stood firmly on the promise which had been given to him, and
therefore he would hope for some fruit of his prayers; yet he wished deeply to
affect his sons, in order that they might take greater care of their brother.
For, it was in no common manner that Benjamin was intrusted to their protection,
when they saw their father altogether overcome and almost lifeless with grief,
until he should receive his son again in safety. Interpreters, however, expound
these words variously. Some think that he complained, because now he was about
to be entirely bereaved. To others, the meaning seems to be, that nothing worse
could happen; since he had lost Joseph, whom he had preferred to all the rest.
Others are disposed to mark a double bereavement, as if he had said, "I have
lost two sons, and now a third follows them." But what, if we should thus
interpret the words, "I see what is my condition; I am a most wretched old man;
my house, which lately was filled with people, I find almost deserted." So that,
in general terms, he is deploring the loss of all his sons, and is not speaking
of a part only. Moreover, it was his design to inspire his sons with a degree of
solicitude which should cause them to attend to their duty with greater fidelity
and diligence. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F621</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he said to the ruler of
his house</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here we perceive the fraternal
disposition of Joseph; though it is uncertain whether he was perfectly
reconciled, as I will shortly show, in its proper place. If, however,
remembering the injury, he loved his brethren less than before, he was still far
from having vindictive feelings towards them. But because it was something
suspicious that foreigners and men of ignoble rank should be received in a
friendly manner, like known guests, to a banquet, by the chief governor of the
kingdom, the sons of Jacob would conceive a new fear; namely, that he wished to
cast them all into chains; and that their money had been craftily concealed in
their sacks, in order that it might prove the occasion of accusation against
them. It is however probable, that the crime which they had committed against
Joseph, occurred to their minds, and that this fear had proceeded from a guilty
conscience. For, unless the judgment of God had tormented them, there was no
cause why they should apprehend such an act of perfidy. It may seem absurd, that
unknown men should be received to a feast by a prince of the highest dignity.
But why not rather incline to a different conjecture; namely, that the governor
of Egypt has done this for the purpose of exhibiting to his friends the new and
unwonted spectacle of eleven brethren sitting at one table? It will, indeed,
sometimes happen that similar anxiety to that felt by Joseph's brethren, may
invade even the best of men; but I would rather ascribe it to the judgment of
God, that the sons of Jacob, whose conscience accused them of having inhumanely
treated their brother, suspected that they would be dealt with in the same
manner. However, they take an early opportunity of vindicating themselves,
before inquiry is made respecting the theft. Now, freely to declare that the
money had been found in their sacks, and that they had brought it from home to
repay it immediately was a strong mark of their innocence. Moreover, they do
this in the very porch of the house, because they suspected that, as soon as
they entered, the question would be put to
them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Peace be to
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Because
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;wl&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>shalom</i>,) among the Hebrews, signifies not only peace, but any prosperous
and desirable condition, as well as any joyful event, this passage may be
expounded in two ways: either that the ruler of Joseph's house commands them to
be of a peaceful and secure mind; or that he pronounces it to be well and happy
with them. The sum of his answer, however, amounts to this, that there was no
reason for fear, because their affairs were in a prosperous state. And since,
after the manner of men, it was not possible that they should have paid the
money for the corn which was found in their sacks, he ascribes this to the favor
of God. For though true religion was then almost extinct in the world, God
nevertheless caused some knowledge of his goodness always to remain in the
hearts of men, which should render them responsible. Hence it has happened that,
following nature as their guide, unbelievers have called every peculiarly
excellent gift <i>Divine</i>. Moreover, because corruption was so prevalent,
that each nation deemed it lawful to worship different gods, the ruler of
Joseph's house distinguishes the God worshipped by the sons of Jacob from
Egyptian idols. The conjecture, however, is probable, that this man had been
imbued with some sense of religion. We know how great was the arrogance of that
nation, and that it supposed the whole world besides, to be deceived in the
worship of gods. Therefore, unless he had learned something better, he never
would have assigned so great an honor to any other gods than those of his own
country. Moreover, he does not ascribe the miracle to the God of the land of
Canaan, but to the peculiar God of their father. I, therefore, do not doubt that
Joseph, though not permitted openly to correct anything in the received
superstitions, endeavored, at least in his own house, to establish the true
worship of the one God, and always held fast the covenant, concerning which, as
a boy, he had heard his father speak. This is the more to be observed, because
the holy man could not swerve, even in the least degree, from the common
practice, without incurring the odium of a nation so proud. Therefore, the
excellency of Joseph is commended in the person of his steward; because without
fear of public envy, he gives honor, within his own walls, to the true God. If
any one should ask, whence he knew that Jacob was a worshipped of the true God;
the answer is ready; that Joseph, notwithstanding his assumed severity, had
commanded that Simon should be gently treated in prison. Though he had been left
as a hostage, yet, if he had been regarded as a spy, the keeper of the prison
would have dealt more harshly with him. There must, therefore, have been some
command given respecting the humane or moderate treatment of him. Whence the
probable conjecture is elicited, that Joseph had explained the affair to his
steward, who was admitted to his secret
counsels.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Against Joseph came at
noon-day</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is doubtful whether this was the
ordinary hour of dining among the Egyptians, or whether Joseph, on that day, sat
down earlier than he was accustomed to do, on account of his guests. It is,
however, most likely that the usual custom of dining was observed. Although,
among the people of the East, there might be a different manner of living,
dinners were in use, not only among the Egyptians, but also in Judea, and in
other neighboring regions. Yet it is probable that this was to them, also, in
the place of a supper, both because they would sit long at table, and our quick
method of eating would not have been tolerable to people in those heated climes;
especially when they received guests with greater luxury than usual, as it will
presently appear, was done at this time. The washing of the feet, (as we have
seen before,) was a part of hospitality, and intended to relieve weariness;
because, in those parts, the feet might easily become inflamed whenever they
journeyed on foot. It was also more honorable, according to ancient custom, that
a portion of food should be sent to each from Joseph, rather than that it should
be distributed by the cook. But because these things are trivial, and are not
conducive to piety, I only slightly touch upon them; and would even omit them
entirely, except that, to remove a scruple from the minds of the unskillful, is
sometimes useful, if it be but done sparingly and with
brevity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>32.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because the Egyptians might
not eat, etc</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F622</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Moses says they might not eat with the Hebrews, because they abhorred it, as
being unlawful. For seeing that their religion forbade it, they were so bound,
that they could not do what they did not dare to do. This passage teaches us how
great was the pride of that nation; for, whence did it arise that they so
utterly detested the Hebrews, unless because they thought themselves alone to be
pure and holy in the world, and acceptable to God? God, indeed, commands his
worshipers to abstain from all the pollutions of the Gentiles. But it behaves
any one who separates himself from others, to be himself pure and upright.
Therefore superstitious persons vainly attempt to claim this privilege for
themselves, seeing they carry their impurity within, and are destitute of
sincerity. Superstition, also, is affected with another disease; namely, that it
is full of pride, so that it despises all men, under the pretext that they are
vicious. It is asked, however, whether the Egyptians were separated from Joseph,
because they regarded him as polluted: for this the words of Moses seem to
intimate. If this interpretation is received, then they esteemed their false
religion so highly, that they did not scruple to load their governor with
reproaches. I rather conjecture, that Joseph sat apart from them, for the sake
of honor; since it would be absurd that they, who disdained to sit at the same
table with him, should be invited as his guests. Therefore it is probable that
this distinct order was made by Joseph himself, that he might maintain his own
dignity; and yet that the sons of Jacob were not mixed with the Egyptians,
because the former were an abomination to the latter. For though the origin of
Joseph was known, yet he had so passed over to the Egyptians, that he had become
as one of their body. For which reason, also, the king had given him a name,
when he adorned him with the insignia of his office as chief governor. Now, when
we see that the church of God was, at that time, so proudly despised by profane
men, we need not wonder that we also, at the present day, are subjected to
similar reproach. Meanwhile, we must endeavor to keep ourselves pure from the
filth of the world, for the Lord's sake; and yet this desire must be so at
tempered, that we may be alienated from the vices, rather than from the persons
of men. For on this account does God sanctify his children, that they may beware
of the vices of the unbelievers among whom they are conversant; and nevertheless
may allure, as many as are curable, to a participation of their piety. Two
things are here to be attended to; first, that we may be fully persuaded of the
genuineness of our faith; secondly, that our excessive and fruitless
fastidiousness may not entirely alienate many from the Lord, who otherwise might
have been won. For we are not expressly commanded so to abhor the wicked, as not
eat with them; but to avoid such association as may subject us to the same yoke.
Besides, this passage confirms what I have before said, that the Hebrews had
derived their name, not from their passing over the river; (as some falsely
imagine,) but from their ancestor Heber. Nor was the fame of a single small and
distantly situated family, sufficiently celebrated in Egypt, to become the cause
of public dissension.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>33.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The first-born according to
his birthright</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F623</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Although of the sons of Jacob four were born of bond-women; yet, since they were
the elder, they had precedence of their younger brethren, who had descended from
free-born mothers; whence it appears that they had been accustomed by their
father to keep this order. What, then, some one may say, becomes of the
declaration, "the son of the bond-woman shall not be heir with the son of the
free-woman?" Truly, I think, since Ishmael was rejected, by the divine oracle
proceeding from the mouth of Sarah, as Esau was afterwards, Jacob was fully
taught that he had as many heirs as he had sons. Hence arose that equality which
caused each to keep his place, first, middle, or last, according to his age. But
the design of Moses was to show, that although Benjamin was the youngest, yet he
was preferred to all the rest in honor; because Joseph could not refrain from
giving him the principal token of his love. It was, indeed, his intention to
remain unknown; but affection so far prevails, that, beyond the purpose of his
mind, he suddenly breaks out into a declaration of his affection. From the
concluding portion of the chapter we gather, what I recently intimated, that the
feast was unusually luxurious, and that they were received to it, in a liberal
and joyful manner, beyond the daily custom. For the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rk&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>shakar</i>,) they "were merry," signifies, either that they were not always
accustomed to drink wine, or that there was more than ordinary indulgence at the
sumptuous tables spread for them. Here, however, no intemperance is implied, (so
that drunkards may not plead the example of the holy fathers as a pretext for
their crime,) but an honorable and moderate liberality. I acknowledge, indeed,
that the word has a double meaning, and is often taken in an ill sense; as in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;010921&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
9:21, and in similar places: but in the present instance the design of Moses is
clear. Should any one object, that a frugal use of food and drink is simply that
which suffices for the nourishing of the body: I answer, although food is
properly for the supply of our necessities, yet the legitimate use of it may
proceed further. For it is not in vain, that our food has savor as well as vital
nutriment; but thus our heavenly Father sweetly delights us with his delicacies.
And his benignity is not in vain commended in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;19A415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
104:15, where he is said to create "wine that maketh glad the heart of man."
Nevertheless, the more kindly he indulges us, the more solicitously ought we to
restrict ourselves to a frugal use of his gifts. For we know how unbridled are
the appetites of the flesh. Whence it happens that, in abundance, it is almost
always lascivious, and in penury, impatient. We must, however, adhere to St.
Paul's method, that we know how to abound and to suffer need; that is, we must
take great care if we have unusual plenty, that it does not hurry us into
luxury; and, on the other hand, we must see to it, that we bear poverty with an
equal mind. Some one, perhaps, will say, that the flesh is more than
sufficiently ingenious in giving a specious color to its excesses; and,
therefore, nothing more should be allowed to it than necessity demands. And,
truly, I confess, we must diligently attend to what Paul prescribes,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he commanded the steward of
his house</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here Moses relates how skillfully
Joseph had contrived to try the dispositions of his brethren. We have said
elsewhere that, whereas God has commanded us to cultivate simplicity, we are not
to take this, and similar examples, as affording license to turn aside to
indirect and crafty arts. For it may have been that Joseph was impelled by a
special influence of the Spirit to this course. He had also a reason, of no
common kind, for inquiring very strictly in what manner his brethren were
affected. Charity is not suspicious. Why, then, does he so distrust his
brethren; and why cannot he suppose that they have anything good, unless he
shall first have subjected them to the most rigid examination? Truly, since he
had found them to be exceedingly cruel and perfidious, it is but an excusable
suspicion, if he does not believe them to be changed for the better, until he
has obtained a thorough perception and conviction of their penitence. But since,
in this respect, it is a rare and very difficult virtue to observe a proper
medium, we must beware of imitating the example of Joseph, in an austere course
of acting, unless we have laid all vindictive feelings aside, and are pure and
free from all enmity. For love, when it is pure, and exempt from all turbid
influence, will best decide how far it is right to proceed. It may, however, be
asked, "If the sons of Jacob had been easily induced to betray the safety of
Benjamin, what would Joseph himself have done?" We may readily conjecture, that
he examined their fidelity, in order that, if he should find them dishonest, he
might retain Benjamin, and drive them with shame from his presence. But, by
pursuing this method, his father would have been deserted, and the Church of God
ruined. And certainly, it is not without hazard to himself that he thus
terrifies them: because he could scarcely have avoided the necessity of
denouncing some more grievous and severe punishment against them, if they had
again relapsed. It was, therefore, due to the special favor of God, that they
proved themselves different from what he had feared. In the meantime, the
advantage of his examination was twofold; first, because the clearly ascertained
integrity of his brethren rendered his mind more placable towards them; and
secondly, because it lightened, at least in some degree, the former infamy,
which they had contracted by their
wickedness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And put my cup, the silver
cup</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It may seem wonderful that, considering
his great opulence, Joseph had not rather drunk out of a golden cup. Doubtless,
either the moderation of that age was still greater than has since prevailed,
and the splendor of it less sumptuous; or else this conduct must be attributed
to the moderation of the man, who, in the midst of universal license, yet was
contented with a plain and decent, rather than with a magnificent style of
living. Unless, perhaps, on account of the excellence of the workmanship, the
silver was more valuable than gold: as it is manifest from secular history, that
the workmanship has often been more expensive than the material itself. It is,
however, probable, that Joseph was sparing in domestic splendor, for the sake of
avoiding envy. For unless he had been prudently on his guard, a contention would
have arisen between him and the courtiers, resulting from a spirit of emulation.
Moreover, he commands the cup to be enclosed in Benjamin's sack, in order that
he might claim him as his own, when convicted of the theft, and might send the
rest away: however, he accuses all alike, as if he knew not who among them had
committed the crime. And first, he reproves their ingratitude, because, when
they had been so kindly received, they made the worst possible return; next, he
contends that the crime was inexpiable, because they had stolen what was most
valuable to him; namely, the cup in which he was accustomed both to drink and to
divine. And he does this through his steward, whom he had not trained to acts of
tyranny and violence. Whence I infer, that the steward was not altogether
ignorant of his master's design.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whereby indeed, he
divineth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F624</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This clause is variously expounded. For some take it as if Joseph pretended that
he consulted soothsayers in order to find out the thief. Others translate it,
"by which he has tried you, or searched you out;" others, that the stolen cup
had given Joseph an unfavorable omen. The genuine sense seems to me to be this:
that he had used the cup for divinations and for magical arts; which, however,
we have said, he feigned, for the sake of aggravating the charge brought against
them. But the question arises, how does Joseph allow himself to resort to such
an expedient? For besides that it was sinful for him to profess augury; he
vainly and unworthily transfers to imaginary deities the honor due only to
divine grace. On a former occasion, he had declared that he was unable to
interpret dreams, except so far as God should suggest the truth to him; now he
obscures this entire ascription of praise to divine grace; and what is worse, by
boasting that he is a magician rather than proclaiming himself a prophet of God,
he impiously profanes the gift of the Holy Spirit. Doubtless, in this
dissimulation, it is not to be denied, that he sinned grievously. Yet I think
that, at the first, he had endeavored, by all means in his power, to give unto
God his due honor; and it was not his fault that the whole kingdom of Egypt was
ignorant of the fact that he excelled in skill, not by magical arts, but by a
celestial gift. But since the Egyptians were accustomed to the illusions of the
magicians, this ancient error so prevailed, that they believed Joseph to be one
of them; and I do not doubt that this rumor was spread abroad among the people,
although contrary to his desire and intention. Now Joseph, in feigning himself
to be a stranger to his brethren, combines many falsehoods in one, and takes
advantage of the prevailing vulgar opinion that he used auguries. Whence we
gather, that when any one swerves from the right line, he is prone to fall into
various sins. Wherefore, being warned by this example, let us learn to allow
ourselves in nothing except what we know is approved by God. But especial)y must
we avoid all dissimulation, which either produces or confirms mischievous
impostures. Besides, we are warned, that it is not sufficient for any one to
oppose a prevailing vice for a time; unless he add constancy of resistance, even
though the evil may become excessive. For he discharges his duty very
defectively, who, having once testified that he is displeased with what is evil,
afterwards, by his silence or connivance, gives it a kind of
assent.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they said unto
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The sons of Jacob boldly excuse
themselves, because a good conscience gives them confidence. They also argue
from the greater to the less: for they contend, that their having voluntarily
brought back the money, which they might with impunity have applied to their own
use, was such a proof of their honesty, as to make it incredible that they
should have been so blinded by a little gain, as to bring upon themselves the
greatest disgrace, together with immediate danger of their lives. They,
therefore, declared themselves ready to submit to any punishment, if they were
found guilty of the theft. When the cup was discovered in Benjamin's sack, Moses
does not relate any of their complaints; but only declares, that they testified
the most bitter grief by rending their garments. I do not doubt that they were
struck dumb by the unexpected result; for they were confounded, not only by the
magnitude of their grief, but by perceiving themselves to be obnoxious to
punishment, for that of which their conscience did not accuse them. Therefore,
when they come into the presence of Joseph, they confess the injury, not because
they acknowledge that the crime has been committed by them, but because excuse
would be of no avail; as if they would say, "It is of no use to deny a thing
which is manifest in itself." In this sense, they say that their iniquity has
been found out by God; because, although they had some secret suspicion of
fraud, thinking that this had been a contrivance for the purpose of bringing an
unjust charge against them, they choose rather to trace the cause of their
punishment to the secret judgment of God. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F625</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Some interpreters believe that they here confessed their crime committed against
Joseph; but that opinion is easily refuted, because they constantly affirm that
he had been torn by a wild beast, or had perished by some accident. Therefore,
the more simple meaning is that which I have adduced; that although the truth of
the fact is not apparent, yet they are punished by God as guilty persons. They
do not, however, speak hypocritically; but being troubled and astonished in
their perplexed affairs, there is nothing left for them but the consciousness
that this punishment is inflicted by the secret judgment of God. And I wish that
they who, when smitten by the rod of God, do not immediately perceive the cause,
would adopt the same course; and when they find that men are unjustly incensed
against them, would recall to mind the secret judgments of God, by which it
becomes us to be humbled. Moreover, whereas Judah speaks in the name of them
all, we may hence infer, that he had already obtained precedence among his
brethren. And Moses exhibits him as their head and chief, when he expressly
states that he and the rest came. For though the dignity of primogeniture had
not yet been conferred upon him, by the solemn judgment of his father, yet it
was intended for him. Certainly, in taking the post of speaker for the rest, his
authority appears in his language. Again, it is necessary to recall to memory,
in reference to the language of Joseph, what I have before said, that although
at first he had endeavored to ascribe the glory to God, he now sins in
pretending that he is a soothsayer or diviner. Some, to extenuate the fault, say
that the allusion is, not to the art of augury, but to his skill in judging;
there is, however, no need to resort to forced expositions for the sake of
excusing the man; for he speaks according to the common understanding of the
multitude, and thus foolishly countenances the received
opinion.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, we are my lord's
servants</i></font><font face="Palatino">. They had before called themselves
servants through modesty; now they consign themselves over to him as slaves. But
in the case of Benjamin they plead for a mitigation of the severity of the
punishment; and this is a kind of entreaty, that he might not be capitally
punished, as they had agreed to, at the first.

If Joseph intended to retain Benjamin alone, and to dismiss the others, he would
have done his utmost, to rend the Church of God by the worst possible
dissension. But I have previously shown (what may also be elicited from the
context) that his design was nothing else than to pierce their hearts more
deeply. He must have anticipated great mischief, if he had perceived that they
did not care for their brother: but the Lord provided against this danger, by
causing the earnest apology of Judah not only to soften his mind, but even to
draw forth tears and weeping in
profusion.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let thy servant, I pray thee,
speak a word</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Judah suppliantly asks that leave
may be given him to speak, because his narrative was about to be prolix. And
whereas nobles are offended, and take it angrily, if any address them with too
great familiarity, Judas begins by declaring that he is not ignorant of the
great honor which Joseph had received in Egypt, for the purpose of showing that
he was becoming bold, not through impertinence, but through necessity.
Afterwards he recites in what manner he and his brethren had departed from their
father. There are two principal heads of his discourse; first, that they should
be the means of bringing a sorrow upon their father which would prove fatal; and
secondly, that he had bound himself individually, by covenant, to bring the
youth back. With respect to the grief of his father, it is a sign of no common
filial piety, that he wished himself to be put in Benjamin's place, and to
undergo perpetual exile and servitude, rather than convey to the miserable old
man tidings which would be the cause of his destruction. He proves his sincerity
by offering himself as a surety, in order that he may liberate his brother.

promise." The latter sense is the more appropriate, because, truly, he would not
escape disgrace and censure from his father, as having cruelly betrayed a youth

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F628</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Moses relates in this chapter the manner in which Joseph made himself known to
his brethren. In the first place, he declares, that Joseph had done violence to
his feelings, as long as he presented to them an austere and harsh countenance.
At length the strong fraternal affection, which he had suppressed during the
time that he was breathing severe threatening, poured itself forth with more
abundant force: whence it appears that nothing severe or cruel had before been
harbored in his mind. And whereas it thus bursts forth in tears, this softness
or tenderness is more deserving of praise than if he had maintained an equable
temper. Therefore the stoics speak foolishly when they say, that it is an heroic
virtue not to be touched with compassion. Had Joseph stood inflexible, who would
not have pronounced him to be a stupid, or iron-hearted man? But now, by the
vehemence of his feelings, he manifests a noble magnanimity, as well as a divine
moderation; because he was so superior both to anger and to hatred, that he
ardently loved those who had wickedly conspired to effect his ruin, though they
had received no injury from him. He commands all men to depart, not because he
was ashamed of his kindred, (for he does not afterwards dissemble the fact that
they were his brethren, and he freely permits the report of it to be carried to
the king's palace,) but because he is considerate for their feelings, that he
might not make known their detestable crime to many witnesses. And it was not
the smallest part of his clemency, to desire that their disgrace should be
wholly buried in oblivion. We see, therefore, that witnesses were removed, for
no other reason than that he might more freely comfort his brethren; for he not
only spared them, by not exposing their crime; but when shut up alone with them,
he abstained from all bitterness of language, and gladly administered to them
friendly consolation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am
Joseph</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Although he had given them the clearest
token of his mildness and his love, yet, when he told them his name, they were
terrified, as if he had thundered against them: for while they revolve in their
minds what they have deserved, the power of Joseph seems so formidable to them,
that they anticipate nothing for themselves but death. When, however, he sees
them overcome with fear, he utters no reproach, but only labors to calm their
perturbation. Nay, he continues gently to soothe them, until he has rendered
them composed and cheerful. By this example we are taught to take heed lest
sadness should overwhelm those who are truly and seriously humbled under a sense
of shame. So long as the offender is deaf to reproofs, or securely flatters
himself, or wickedly and obstinately repels admonitions, or excuses himself by
hypocrisy, greater severity is to be used towards him. But rigor should have its
bounds, and as soon as the offender lies prostrate, and trembles under the sense
of his sin, let that moderation immediately follow which may raise him who is
cast down, by the hope of pardon. Therefore, in order that our severity may be
rightly and duly attempered, we must cultivate this inward affection of Joseph,
which will show itself at the proper
time.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come near to me, I pray
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is more efficacious than any mere
words, that he kindly invites them to his embrace. Yet he also tries to remove
their care and fear by the most courteous language he can use. He so attempers
his speech, indeed, that he mildly accuses, and again consoles them;
nevertheless, the consolation greatly predominates, because he sees that they
are on the point of desperation, unless he affords them timely relief. Moreover,
in relating that he had been sold, he does not renew the memory of their guilt,
with the intention of expostulating with them; but only because it is always
profitable that the sense of sin should remain, provided that immoderate terror
does not absorb the unhappy man, after he has acknowledged his fault. And
whereas the brethren of Joseph were more than sufficiently terrified, he insists
the more fully on the second part of his purpose; namely, that he may heal the
wound. This is the reason why he repeats, that God had sent him for their
preservation; that by the counsel of God himself he had been sent beforehand
into Egypt to preserve them alive; and that, in short, he had not been sent into
Egypt by them, but had been led thither by the hand of God.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So now, it was not you that sent
me hither</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is a remarkable passage, in
which we are taught that the right course of events is never so disturbed by the
depravity and wickedness of men, but that God can direct them to a good end. We
are also instructed in what manner and for what purpose we must consider the
providence of God. When men of inquisitive minds dispute concerning it, they not
only mingle and pervert all things without regard to the end designed, but
invent every absurdity in their power, in order to sully the justice of God. And
this rashness causes some pious and moderate men to wish this portion of
doctrine to be concealed from view; for as soon as it is publicly declared that
God holds the government of the whole world, and that nothing is done but by his
will and authority, they who think with little reverence of the mysteries of
God, break forth into various questions, not only frivolous but injurious. But,
as this profane intemperance of mind is to be restrained, so a just measure is
to be observed on the other hand, lest we should encourage a gross ignorance of
those things which are not only made plain in the word of God, but are
exceedingly useful to be known. Good men are ashamed to confess, that what men
undertake cannot be accomplished except by the will of God; fearing lest
unbridled tongues should cry out immediately, either that God is the author of
sin, or that wicked men are not to be accused of crime, seeing they fulfill the
counsel of God. But although this sacrilegious fury cannot be effectually
rebutted, it may suffice that we hold it in detestation. Meanwhile, it is right
to maintain, what is declared by the clear testimonies of Scripture, that
whatever men may contrive, yet, amidst all their tumult, God from heaven
overrules their counsels and attempts; and, in short, does, by their hands, what
he has himself decreed. Good men, who fear to expose the justice of God to the
calumnies of the impious, resort to this distinction, that God <i>wills</i> some
things, but <i>permits</i> others to be done. As if, truly, any degree of
liberty of action, were he to cease from governing, would be left to men. If he
had only <i>permitted</i> Joseph to be carried into Egypt, he had not
<i>ordained</i> him to be the minister of deliverance to his father Jacob and
his sons; which he is now expressly declared to have done. Away, then, with that
vain figment, that, by the <i>permission</i> of God only, and not by his
<i>counsel</i> or <i>will</i>, those evils are committed which he afterwards
turns to a good account. I speak of evils with respect to men, who propose
nothing else to themselves but to act perversely. And as the vice dwells in
them, so ought the whole blame also to be laid upon them. But God works
wonderfully through their means, in order that, from their impurity, he may
bring forth his perfect righteousness. This method of acting is secret, and far
above our understanding. Therefore it is not wonderful that the licentiousness
of our flesh should rise against it. But so much the more diligently must we be
on our guard, that we do not attempt to reduce this lofty standard to the
measure of our own littleness. Let this sentiment remain fixed with us, that
while the lust of men exults, and intemperately hurries them hither and thither,
God is the ruler, and, by his secret rein, directs their motions whithersoever
he pleases. At the same time, however, it must also be maintained, that God acts
so far distinctly from them, that no vice can attach itself to his providence,
and that his decrees have no affinity with the crimes of men. Of which mode of
procedure a most illustrious example is placed before our eyes in this history.
Joseph was sold by his brethren; for what reason, but because they wished, by
any means whatever, to ruin and annihilate him? The same work is ascribed to
God, but for a very different end; namely, that in a time of famine the family
of Jacob might have an unexpected supply of food. Therefore he willed that
Joseph should be as one dead, for a short time, in order that he might suddenly
bring him forth from the grave, as the preserver of life. Whence it appears,
that although he seems, at the commencement, to do the same thing as the wicked;
yet there is a wide distance between their wickedness and his admirable
judgment. Let us now examine the words of Joseph. For the consolation of his
brethren he seems to draw the veil of oblivion over their fault. But we know
that men are not exempt from guilt, although God may, beyond expectation, bring
what they wickedly attempt, to a good and happy issue. For what advantage was it
to Judas that the redemption of the world proceeded from his wicked treachery?
Joseph, however, though he withdraws, in some degree, the minds of his brethren
from a consideration of their own guilt, until they can breathe again after
their immoderate terror, neither traces their fault to God as its cause, nor
really absolves them from it; as we shall see more clearly in the last chapter
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
44:1.) And doubtless, it must be maintained, that the deeds of men are not to be
estimated according to the event, but according to the measure in which they may
have failed in their duty, or may have attempted something contrary to the
Divine command, and may have gone beyond the bounds of their calling. Someone,
for instance, has neglected his wife or children, and has not diligently
attended to their necessities; and though they do not die, unless God wills it,
yet the inhumanity of the father, who wickedly deserted them when he ought to
have relieved them, is not screened or excused by this pretext. Therefore, they
whose consciences accuse them of evil, derive no advantage from the pretense
that the providence of God exonerates them from blame. But on the other hand,
whenever the Lord interposes to prevent the evil of those who desire to injure
us, and not that only, but turns even their wicked designs to our good; he
subdues, by this method, our carnal affections, and renders us more just and
placable. Thus we see that Joseph was a skillful interpreter of the providence
of God, when he borrowed from it an argument for granting forgiveness to his
brethren. The magnitude of the crime committed against him might so have
incensed him as to cause him to burn with the desire of revenge: but when he
reflects that their wickedness had been overruled by the wonderful and unwonted
goodness of God, forgetting the injury received, he kindly embraces the men
whose dishonor God had covered with his grace. And truly charity is ingenious in
hiding the faults of brethren, and therefore she freely applies to this use
anything which may tend to appease anger, and to set enmities at rest. Joseph
also is carried forward to another view of the case; namely, that he had been
divinely chosen to help his brethren. Whence it happens, that he not only remits
their offense, but that, from an earnest desire to discharge the duty enjoined
upon him, he delivers them from fear and anxiety as well as from want. This is
the reason why he asserts that he was ordained to "put for them a remnant," 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F630</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that is, to preserve a remaining seed, or rather to preserve them alive, and
that by an excellent and wonderful deliverance. In saying that he is a father to
Pharaoh, he is not carried away with empty boasting as vain men are wont to be;
nor does he make an ostentatious display of his wealth; but he proves, from an
event so great and incredible, that he had not obtained the post he occupied by
accident, nor by human means; but rather that, by the wonderful counsel of God,
a lofty throne had been raised for him, from which he might succor his father
and his whole family.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thus saith thy son
Joseph</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In giving this command, he shows that
he spoke of his power in order to inspire his father with stronger confidence.
We know how dilatory old men are; and, besides, it was difficult to tear holy
Jacob away from the inheritance which was divinely promised to him. Therefore
Joseph, having pointed out the necessity for the step, declares what a desirable
relief the Lord had offered. It may, however, be asked, why the oracle did not
occur to their minds, concerning which they had been instructed by their
fathers, namely, that they should be strangers and servants in a strange land.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011513&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
15:13.) For it seems that Joseph here promises nothing but mere pleasures, as if
no future adversity was to be apprehended. But though nothing is expressly
declared on this point by Moses, yet I am induced, by a probable conjecture, to
believe that Jacob was not forgetful of the oracle. For, unless he had been
retained by some celestial chain, he never could have remained in Egypt after
the expiration of the time of scarcity. For by remaining there voluntarily, he
would have appeared to cast away the hope of the inheritance promised him by
God. Seeing, then, that he does not provide for his return into the land of
Canaan, but only commands his corpse to be carried thither; nor yet exhorts his
sons to a speedy return, but suffers them to settle in Egypt; he does this, not
from indolence, or because he is allured by the attractions of Egypt, or has
become weary of the land of Canaan; but because he is preparing himself and his
offspring to bear that tyranny, concerning which he had been forewarned by his
father Isaac. Therefore he regards it as an advantage that, at his first coming,
he is hospitably received; but, in the meantime, he revolves in his mind what
had been spoken to Abraham.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the fame thereof was
heard in Pharaoh's house</i></font><font face="Palatino">. What Moses now
relates, was prior in the order of events. For before Joseph sent for his
father, the report of the coming of his brethren had reached the palace. And
Joseph would not have promised so confidently a home to his brethren in Egypt,
except by the king's permission. What, therefore, Moses had before briefly
alluded to, he now more fully explains; namely, that the king, with a ready and
cheerful mind, declared his high esteem for Joseph, in freely offering to his
father and brethren, the most fertile part of Egypt for their dwelling. And from
another statement of Moses it appears that, as long as he lived, the Israelites
were treated with clemency and kindness. For, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;020108&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
1:8, the commencement of the tyranny and cruelty is said to have been made by
his successor, to whom Joseph was
unknown.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And to all of them he gave
each man changes of raiment</i></font><font face="Palatino">. That he furnishes
his brethren with supplies for their journey is not wonderful: but to what
purpose was it that he loaded them with money and garments, seeing they would so
soon return? I, indeed, do not doubt that he did it on account of his father and
the wives of his brethren, in order that they might have less reluctance to
leave the land of Canaan. For he knew that his message would scarcely be
believed, unless some manifest tokens of its truth were presented. It might also
be, that he not only endeavored to allure those who were absent, but that he
also wished to testify, more and more, his love towards his brethren. But the
former consideration has more weight with me, because he took greater care in
furnishing Benjamin than the rest. Jerome has translated the expression,
"changes of raiment," by "two robes," and other interpreters, following him,
expound it as meaning "different kinds of garments." I know not whether this be
solid. I rather suppose they were elegant garments, such as were used at
nuptials and on festal days; for I think that constant custom was silently
opposed to this variety of dress.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>See that ye fall not out by
the way</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some explain the passage as meaning,
that Joseph asks his brethren to be of tranquil mind, and not to disturb
themselves with needless fear; he rather exhorts them, however, to mutual peace.
For, since the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">zgr</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>ragaz</i>) sometimes signifies to tremble or be afraid, and sometimes, to
make a tumult, the latter sense is the more appropriate: for we know that the
children of God are not only easily appeased, if any one has injured them, but
that they also desire others should live together in concord. Joseph was
pacified towards his brethren; but at the same time he admonishes them not to
stir up any strife among themselves. For there was reason to fear lest each, in
attempting to excuse himself, should try to lay the blame on others, and thus
contention would arise. We ought to imitate this kindness of Joseph; that we may
prevent, as much as possible, quarrels and strifes of words; for Christ requires
of his disciples, not only that they should be lovers of peace, but also that
they should be peace-makers. Wherefore, it is our duty to remove, in time, all
matter and occasion of strife. Besides, we must know, that what Joseph taught
his brethren, is the command of the Spirit of God to us all; namely, that we
should not be angry with each other. And because it generally happens that, in
faults common to different parties, one maliciously accuses another; let each of
us learn to acknowledge and confess his own fault, lest altercations should end
in combats.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob's heart
fainted</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We know that some persons have fainted
with sudden and unexpected joy. Therefore, certain interpreters suppose that the
heart of Jacob was, in a sense, suffocated, as if seized by a kind of ecstatic
stupor. But Moses assigns a different cause; namely, that not having confidence
in his sons, he was agitated between hope and fear. And we know, that they who
are held in suspense, by hearing some incredible message, are struck with
torpor, as if they were lifeless. It was not, therefore, a simple affection of
joy, but a certain mingled perturbation which shook the mind of Jacob.
Therefore, Moses shortly after says, that his spirit revived; when he, having
returned to himself, and being composed in mind, believed that which he had
heard to be true. And he shows that his love towards Joseph had not languished
through length of time, inasmuch as he set no value upon his own life, except so
far as it would permit him to enjoy a sight of Joseph. He had before assigned to
himself continual sorrow, even to the grave; but now he declares that he shall
have a joyful
death.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">CHAPTER

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Israel took his
journey</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Because the holy man is compelled to
leave the land of Canaan and to go elsewhere, he offers, on his departure, a
sacrifice to the Lord, for the purpose of testifying that the covenant which God
had made with his fathers was confirmed and ratified to himself. For, though he
was accustomed to exercise himself in the external worship of God, there was yet
a special reason for this sacrifice. And, doubtless, he had then peculiar need
of support, lest his faith should fail: for he was about to be deprived of the
inheritance promised to him, and of the sight of that land which was the type
and the pledge of the heavenly country. Might it not come into his mind that he
had hitherto been deluded with a vain hope? Therefore, by renewing the memory of
the divine covenant, he applies a suitable remedy against falling from the
faith. For this reason, he offers a sacrifice on the very boundaries of that
land, as I have just said; that we might know it to be something more than
usual. And he presents this worship to the God of his fathers, to testify that,
although he is departing from that land, into which Abraham had been called; yet
he does not thereby cut himself off from the God in whose worship he had been
educated. It was truly a remarkable proof of constancy, that when cast out by
famine into another region, so that he might not even be permitted to sojourn in
the land of which he was the lawful lord; he yet retains, deeply impressed on
his mind, the hope of his hidden right. It was not without subjecting himself to
odium that he differed openly from other nations, by worshipping the God of his
fathers. But what profit was there in having a religion different from all
others? Seeing, then, that he does not repent of having worshipped the God of
his fathers, and that he now also perseveres in fear and reverence towards him;
we hence infer how deeply he was rooted in true piety. By offering a sacrifice,
he both increases his own strength, and makes profession of his faith; because,
although piety is not bound to external symbols, yet he will not neglect those
helps, the use of which he has found to be, by no means,
superfluous.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And God spake unto
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In this manner, God proves that the
sacrifice of Jacob was acceptable to him, and again stretches out his hand to
ratify anew his covenant. The vision by night availed for the purpose of giving
greater dignity to the oracle. Jacob indeed, inasmuch as he was docile and ready
to yield obedience to God, did not need to be impelled by force and terror; yet,
because he was a man encompassed with flesh, it was profitable for him that he
should be affected as with the glory of a present God, in order that the word
might penetrate more effectually into his heart. It is, however, proper to
recall to memory what I have said before, that the word was joined with it;
because a silent vision would have profited little or nothing. We know that
superstition eagerly snatches at mere spectres; by which means it presents God
in a form of its own. But since no living image of God can exist without the
word, whenever God has <i>appeared</i> to his servants, he has also
<i>spoken</i> to them. Wherefore, in all outward signs, let us be ever attentive
to his voice, if we would not be deluded by the wiles of Satan. But if those
visions, in which the majesty of God shines, require to be animated by the word,
then they who obtrude signs, invented at the will of men, upon the Church,
exhibit nothing else than the empty pomps of a profane theater. Just as in the
Papacy, those things which are called sacraments, are lifeless phantoms which
draw away deluded souls from the true God. Let this mutual connection, then, be
observed, that the vision which gives greater dignity to the word, precedes it;
and that the word follows immediately, as if it were the soul of the vision. And
there is no question that this was an appearance of the visible glory of God,
which did not leave Jacob in suspense and hesitation; but which, by removing his
doubt, firmly sustained him, so that he confidently embraced the
oracle.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jacob,
Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The design of the repetition was to
render him more attentive. For, by thus familiarly addressing him, God more
gently insinuates himself into his mind: as, in the Scripture, he kindly allures
us, that he may prepare us to become his disciples. The docility of the holy man
appears hence, that as soon as he is persuaded that God speaks, he replies that
he is ready to receive with reverence whatever may be spoken, to follow
wheresoever he may be called, and to undertake whatever may be commanded.
Afterwards, a promise is added, by which God confirms and revives the faith of
his servant. Whereas, the descent into Egypt was to him a sad event, he is
bidden to be of good and cheerful mind; inasmuch as the Lord would always be his
keeper, and after having increased him there to a great nation, would bring him
back again to the place, whence he now compelled him to depart. And, indeed,
Jacob's chief consolation turned on this point; that he should not perpetually
wander up and down as an exile, but should, at length, enjoy the expected
inheritance. For, since the possession of the land of Canaan was the token of
the Divine favor, of spiritual blessings, and of eternal felicity; if holy Jacob
was defrauded of this, it would have availed him little or nothing to have
riches, and all kinds of wealth and power heaped upon him, in Egypt. The return
promised him is not, however, to be understood of his own person, but refers to
his posterity. Now, as Jacob, relying on the promise, is commanded boldly to go
down into Egypt; so it is the duty of all the pious, after his example, to
derive such strength from the grace of God, that they may gird themselves to
obey his commands. The title by which God here distinguishes himself, is
attached to the former oracles which Jacob had received by tradition from his
fathers. For why does he not rather call himself the Creator of heaven and
earth, than the God of Isaac or of Abraham, except for this reason, that the
dominion over the land of Canaan depends on the previous covenant, which he now
ratifies anew? At the same time also, he encourages his servant by examples
drawn from his own family, lest he should cease to proceed with constancy in his
calling. For, when he had seen that his father Isaac, and had heard that his
grandfather Abraham, though long surrounded by great troubles, never gave way to
any temptations, it ill became him to be overcome by weariness in the same
course; especially since, in the act of dying, they handed their lamp to their
posterity, and took diligent care to leave the light of their faith to survive
them in their family. In short, Jacob is taught that he must not seek, in
crooked and diverse paths, that God whom he had learned, from his childhood, to
regard as the Ruler of the family of Abraham; provided it did not degenerate
from his piety. Moreover, we have elsewhere stated how far, in this respect, the
authority of the Fathers ought to prevail. For it was not the design of God,
either that Jacob should subject himself to men, or should approve, without
discrimination, whatever was handed down from his ancestors, &#8212; seeing that
he so often condemns in the Jews, a foolish imitation of their fathers, &#8212;
but his design was to keep Jacob in the true knowledge of
himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joseph shall put his hand
upon thine eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This clause was added for the
sake of showing greater indulgence. For though Jacob, in desiring that, when he
died, his eyes should be closed by the hand of Joseph, showed that some
infirmity of the flesh was involved in the wish; yet God is willing to comply
with it, for the sake of moderating the grief of a fresh banishment. Moreover,
we know that the custom of closing the eyes was of the greatest antiquity; and
that this office was discharged by one most closely connected with the deceased
either by blood or affection.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob rose
up</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By using the words "rose up," Moses seems
to denote that Jacob received new vigor from the vision. For although the former
promises were not forgotten, yet the addition of the recent memorial came most
opportunely, in order that he, bearing the land of Canaan in his heart, might
endure his absence from it with equanimity. When it is said that he took with
him all that he had acquired, or possessed in the land of Canaan, it is probable
that his servants and handmaids came together with his cattle. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F631</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But, on his departure, no mention is made of them: nay, a little afterwards,
when Moses enumerates the separate heads of each tribe, he says that only
seventy souls came with him. Should any one say that Jacob had been compelled to
liberate his slaves, on account of the famine, or that he lost them through some
misfortune to us unknown, the conjecture is unsatisfactory; for it is most
incredible that he, who had been an industrious master of a family, and had
abounded in the earthly blessings of God, should have become so entirely
destitute, that not even one little servant remained to him. It is more probable
that, when the children of Israel were themselves employed in servile works,
they were then deprived of their servants in Egypt; or, at least, a sufficient
number was not left them, to inspire them with confidence in any enterprise. And
although, in the account of their deliverance, Moses is silent respecting their
servants, yet it may be easily gathered from other passages, that they did not
depart without servants.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These are the names of the
children of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He recounts the sons and
grandsons of Jacob, till he arrives at their full number. The statement that
there were but seventy souls, while Stephen
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;440714&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
7:14) adds five more, is made, I doubt not, by an error of the transcribers. For
the solution of Augustine is weak, that Stephen, by a prolepsis, enumerates also
three who afterwards were born in Egypt; for he must then have formed a far
longer catalogue. Again, this interpretation is repugnant to the design of the
Holy Spirit, as we shall hereafter see: because the subject here treated of, is
not respecting the number of children Jacob left behind him at his death, but
respecting the number of his family on the day when he went down into Egypt. He
is said to have brought with him, or to have found there, seventy souls born
unto him, in order that the comparison of this very small number, with that
immense multitude which the Lord afterwards led forth, might the more fully
illustrate His wonderful benediction. But that the error is to be imputed to the
transcribers, is hence apparent, that with the Greek interpreters, it has crept
only into one passage, while, elsewhere, they agree with the Hebrew reckoning.
And it was easy when numerals were signified by marks, for one passage to be
corrupted. I suspect also that this happened from the following cause, that
those who had to deal with the Scripture were generally ignorant of the Hebrew
language; so that, conceiving the passage in the Acts to be vitiated, they
rashly changed the true number. If any one, however, chooses rather to suppose
that Luke in this instance accommodated himself to the rude and illiterate, who
were accustomed to the Greek version, I do not contend with them. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F632</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In the words of Moses there is, indeed, no ambiguity, nor is there any reason
why so small a matter, in which there is no absurdity, should give us any
trouble; for it is not wonderful, that, in this mode of notation, one letter
should have been put in the place of another. It is more to the purpose, to
examine wherefore this small number of persons is recorded by Moses. For, the
more improbable it appears, that seventy men, in no lengthened space of time,
should have grown to such a multitude; so much the more clearly does the grace
of God shine forth. And this is also the reason why he so frequently mentions
this number. For it was, by no means, according to human apprehension, a likely
method of propagating the Church, that Abraham should live childless even to old
age; that, after the death of Isaac, Jacob alone should remain; that he, being
increased with a moderate family, should be shut up in a corner of Egypt, and
that there an incredible number of people should spring up from this dry
fountain. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F633</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
When Moses declares that Shaul, one of the sons of Simon, was born of a
Canaanitish woman, while he does not even mention the mothers of the other sons,
his intention, I doubt not, is to fix a mark of dishonor on his race. For the
holy Fathers were on their guard, not to mix in marriage with that nation, from
which they were separated by the decree of heaven. When Moses, having put down
the names of Leah's sons, says there were thirty-three souls, whereas he has
only mentioned thirty-two; I understand that Jacob himself is to be reckoned the
first in order. The statement that he had so many sons or daughters by Leah does
not oppose this conclusion. For although, strictly speaking, his discourse is
concerning sons, yet he commences with the head of the family. I reject the
interpretation of the Hebrews, who suppose Jochebed the mother of Moses to be
included, as being overstrained. A question suggests itself concerning the
daughters, whether there were more than two. If Dinah alone were named, it might
be said that express mention was made of her, because of the notorious fact
which had happened to her. But since Moses enumerates another female in the
progeny of Aser, I rather conjecture that these had remained unmarried, or
single; for no mention is made of those who were
wives.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he sent Judah before him
unto Joseph</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Because Goshen 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F634</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
had been selected by Joseph as the abode of his father and his brethren, Jacob
now desires, that, on his coming, he may find the place prepared for him: for
the expression which Moses uses, implies, not that he requires a house to be
built and furnished for him, but only that he may be permitted there to pitch
his tent without molestation. For it was necessary that some unoccupied place
should be assigned him; lest, by taking possession of the pastures or fields of
the inhabitants, he might give them an occasion for exciting a
tumult.</font><br><font face="Palatino">In the meeting of Jacob with his son
Joseph, Moses describes their vehement feeling of joy, to show that the holy
Fathers were not destitute of natural affection. It must, however, be remembered
that, although the affections spring from good principles, yet they always
contract some evil, from the corrupt propensity of the flesh; and have chiefly
this fault, that they always exceed their bounds: whence it follows, that they
do not need to be eradicated, but to be kept within due
bounds.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will go up and show
Pharaoh</i></font><font face="Palatino">. After Joseph had gone forth to meet
his father for the purpose of doing him honor, he also provides what will be
useful for him. On this account, he advises Jacob to declare that he and all his
family were keepers of cattle, to the end that he might obtain, from the king, a
dwelling-place for them, in the land of Goshen. Now although his moderation
deserves commendation on the ground, that he usurps no authority to himself, but
that, as one of the common people, he waits the pleasure of the king: he yet may
be thought craftily to have devised a pretext, by which he might circumvent the
king. We see what he desired. Seeing that the land of Goshen was fertile, and
celebrated for its rich pastures; this advantage so allured his mind, that he
wished to fix his father there: but then, keeping out of Pharaoh's sight the
richness of the land, he puts forth another reason; namely, that Jacob with his
sons, were men held in abomination, and that, therefore, he was seeking a place
of seclusion, in which they might dwell apart from the Egyptians. It is not,
however, very difficult to untie this knot. The fertility of the land of Goshen
was so fully known to the king, that no room was left for fraud or calming,
(though kings are often too profuse, and foolishly waste much, because they know
not what they grant,) yea, Pharaoh, of his own accord, had offered them,
unsolicited, the best and choicest place in the kingdom. Therefore this bounty
of his was not elicited from him by stratagem; because he was free to form his
own judgment respecting what he would give. And truly Joseph, in order that he
might act modestly, felt it necessary to seek a habitation in Goshen, on this
pretext. For it would have been absurd, or at least inconsiderate, for men who
were obscure and strangers, to desire an abode in the best and most convenient
place for themselves, as if they possessed a right to choose for themselves.
Joseph, therefore, having regard to his own modesty and that of his father,
adduces another cause, which was yet a true one. For seeing that the Egyptians
held the occupation of shepherds in abhorrence, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F635</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he explains to the king that this would be a suitable retreat for his brethren.
Herein was no dissimulation, because, in no other place, was a quiet habitation
accessible to them. Nevertheless, though it was hard for the holy Fathers to be
thus opprobriously rejected, and, as it were, to be loathed by a whole nation;
yet this ignominy with which they were branded, was most profitable to
themselves. For, had they been mingled with the Egyptians, they might have been
scattered far and wide; but now, seeing that they are objects of detestation,
and are thought unworthy to be admitted to common society, they learn, in this
state of separation from others, to cherish more fervently mutual union between
themselves; and thus the body of the Church, which God had set apart from the
whole world, is not dispersed. So the Lord often permits us to be despised or
rejected by the world, that being liberated and cleansed from its pollution, we
may cultivate holiness. Finally, he does not suffer us to be bound by chains to
the earth, in order that we may be borne upward to
heaven.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">CHAPTER

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then Joseph
came</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Joseph indirectly intimates to the king,
his desire to obtain a habitation for his brethren in the land of Goshen. Yet
this modesty was (as we have said) free from cunning. For Pharaoh both
immediately recognizes his wish, and liberally grants it to him; declaring
beforehand that the land of Goshen was most excellent. Whence we gather, that
what he gave, he gave in the exercise of his own judgment, not in ignorance; and
that he was not unacquainted with the wish of Joseph, who yet did not dare to
ask for what was the best. Joseph may be easily excused for having commanded his
father, with the greater part of his brethren, to remain in that region. For
neither was it possible for them to bring their cattle along with them, nor yet
to leave their cattle in order to come and salute the king; until some settled
abode was assigned them, where, having pitched their tents, they might arrange
their affairs. For it would have shown a want of respect, to take possession of
a place, as if it had been granted to them; when they had not yet received the
permission of the king. They, therefore, remain in that district, in a state of
suspense, until, having ascertained the will of the king, they may, with greater
certainty, fix their abode there. That Joseph "brought five from the extreme
limits of his brethren," 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F636</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is commonly thus explained, that they who were of least stature were brought
into the presence of the king: because it was to be feared lest he might take
the stronger into his army. But since the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hxq</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>qatsah</i>) signifies the two extremities, the beginning and the end; I
think they were chosen from the first and the last, in order that the king, by
looking at them might form his judgment concerning the age of the
whole.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy servants are
shepherds</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This confession was humiliating to
the sons of Jacob, and especially to Joseph himself, whose high, and almost
regal dignity, was thus marked with a spot of disgrace: for among the Egyptians
(as we have said) this kind of life was disgraceful and infamous. Why, then, did
not Joseph adopt the course, which he might easily have done, of describing his
brethren as persons engaged in agriculture, or any other honest and creditable
method of living? They were not so addicted to the feeding of cattle as to be
altogether ignorant of agriculture, or incapable of accustoming themselves to
other modes of gaining a livelihood: and although they would not immediately
have found it productive, we see how ready the liberality of the king was to
help them. Indeed it would not have been difficult for them to become invested
with offices at court. How then does it happen that Joseph, knowingly and
purposely, exposes his brethren to an ignominy, which must bring dishonor also
on himself, except because he was not very anxious to escape from worldly
contempt? To live in splendor among the Egyptians would have had, at first, a
plausible appearance; but his family would have been placed in a dangerous
position. Now, however, their mean and contemptible mode of life proves a wall
of separation between them and the Egyptians: yea, Joseph seems purposely to
labor to cast off, in a moment, the nobility he had acquired, that his own
posterity might not be swallowed up in the population of Egypt, but might rather
merge in the body of his ancestral family. If, however, this consideration did
not enter their minds, there is no doubt that the Lord directed their tongues,
so as to prevent the noxious admixture, and to keep the body of the Church pure
and distinct. This passage also teaches us, how much better it is to possess a
remote corner in the courts of the Lord, than to dwell in the midst of palaces,
beyond the precincts of the Church. Therefore, let us not think it grievous to
secure a sacred union with the sons of God, by enduring the contempt and
reproaches of the world; even as Joseph preferred this union to all the luxuries
of Egypt. But if any one thinks that he cannot otherwise serve God in purity,
than by rendering himself disgusting to the world; away with all this folly! The
design of God was this, to keep the sons of Jacob in a degraded position, until
he should restore them to the land of Canaan: for the purpose, then, of
preserving themselves in unity till the promised deliverance should take place,
they did not conceal the fact that they were shepherds. We must beware,
therefore, lest the desire of empty honor should elate us: whereas the Lord
reveals no other way of salvation, than that of bringing us under discipline.
Wherefore let us willingly be without honor, for a time, that, hereafter, angels
may receive us to a participation of their eternal glory. By this example also,
they who are brought up in humble employments, are taught that they have no need
to be ashamed of their lot. It ought to be enough, and more than enough, for
them, that the mode of living which they pursue is lawful, and acceptable to
God. The remaining confession of the brethren
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014704&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
47:4) was not unattended with a sense of shame; in which they say, that they had
come to sojourn there, compelled by hunger; but hence arose advantage not to be
despised. For as they came down few, and perishing with hunger, and so branded
with infamy that scarcely any one would deign to speak with them; the glory of
God afterwards shone so much the more illustriously out of this darkness, when,
in the third century from that time, he wonderfully led them forth, a mighty
nation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Pharaoh spake unto
Joseph</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is to be ascribed to the favor of
God that Pharaoh was not offended when they desired that a separate
dwelling-place might be granted to them; for we know that nothing is more
indignantly borne by kings, than that their favors should be rejected. Pharaoh
offers them a perpetual home, but they rather wish to depart from him. Should
any one ascribe this to modesty, on the ground that it would have been proud to
ask for the right of citizenship, in order that they might enjoy the same
privilege as natives; the suggestion is indeed plausible. It is, however,
fallacious, for in asking to be admitted as guests and strangers, they took
timely precaution that Pharaoh should not hold them bound in the chains of
servitude. The passage of Sophocles is known: &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">It was therefore of importance to the sons of Jacob
to declare, <i>in limine</i>, on what condition they wished to live in Egypt.
And so much the more inexcusable was the cruelty exercised towards them, when,
in violation of this compact, they were most severely oppressed, and were denied
that opportunity of departure, for which they had stipulated. Isaiah indeed says
that the king of Egypt had some pretext for his conduct, because the sons of
Jacob had voluntarily placed themselves under his authority,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;235204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
52:4;) but he is speaking comparatively, in order that he may the more
grievously accuse the Assyrians, who had invaded the posterity of Jacob, when
they were quiet in their own country, and expelled them thence by unjust
violence. Therefore the law of hospitality was wickedly violated when the
Israelites were oppressed as slaves, and when the return into their own country,
for which they had silently covenanted, was denied them; though they had
professed that they had come thither as guests; for fidelity and humanity ought
to have been exercised towards them, by the king, when once they were received
under his protection. It appears, therefore, that the children of Israel so
guarded themselves, as in the presence of God, that they had just ground of
complaint against the Egyptians. But seeing that the pledge given them by the
king proved of no advantage to them according to the flesh; let the faithful
learn, from their example, to train themselves to patience. For it commonly
happens, that he who enters the court of a tyrant, is under the necessity of
laying down his liberty at the door.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The land of
Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is recorded not only to show that
Jacob was courteously received, but also, that nothing was given him by Joseph
but at the command of the king. For the greater was his power, the more strictly
was he bound to take care, lest, being liberal with the king's property, he
might defraud both him and his people. And I would that this moderation so
prevailed among the nobles of the world, that they would conduct themselves, in
their private affairs, no otherwise than if they were plebeians: but now, they
seem to themselves to have no power, unless they may prove it by their license
to sin. And although Joseph, by the king's permission, places his family amidst
the best pastures; yet he does not avail himself of the other portion of the
royal beneficence, to make his brethren keepers of the king's cattle; not only
because this privilege would have excited the envy of many against them, but
because he was unwilling to be entangled in such a
snare.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joseph brought in Jacob his
father</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Although Moses relates, in a continuous
narrative, that Jacob was brought to the king, yet I do not doubt that some time
had intervened; at least, till he had obtained a place wherein he might dwell;
and where he might leave his family more safely, and with a more tranquil mind;
and also, where he might refresh himself, for a little while, after the fatigue
of his journey. And whereas he is said to have blessed Pharaoh, by this term
Moses does not mean a common and profane salutation, but the pious and holy
prayer of a servant of God. For the children of this world salute kings and
princes for the sake of honor, but, by no means, raise their thoughts to God.
Jacob acts otherwise; for he adjoins to civil reverence that pious affection
which causes him to commend the safety of the king to God. And Jeremiah
prescribes this rule to the Jews, that they should pray for the peace of Babylon
as long as they were to live in exile; because in the peace of that land and
empire their own peace would be involved.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;242907&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
29:7.) If this duty was enjoined on miserable captives, forcibly deprived of
their liberty, and torn from their own country; how much more did Jacob owe it
to a king so humane and beneficent? But of whatever character they may be who
rule over us, we are commanded to offer up public prayers for them.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;540201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 2:1.) Therefore the same subjection to authority is required severally
from each of us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How old art
thou?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This familiar question proves that Jacob
was received courteously and without ceremony. But the answer is of far greater
moment, in which Jacob declares that the time of his pilgrimage was a hundred
and thirty years. For the Apostle, in his epistle to the Hebrews,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:13-16,) gathers hence the memorable doctrine, that God was not ashamed to be
called the God of the patriarchs, because they had confessed themselves to be
strangers and pilgrims on the earth. Of one man only this is mentioned; but
because he had been instructed by his forefathers, and had handed down the same
instruction to his son, the Apostle honors them all with the same eulogy.
Therefore, as they were not ashamed to wander during the whole course of their
life, and to be opprobriously called foreigners and strangers wherever they
came; so God vouchsafed to them the incomparable dignity, that they should be
heirs of heaven. But (as it has been said before) no persons ever had a more
peculiar and hereditary possession in the world, than the holy fathers had in
the land of Canaan. The Lord is said to have cast his line, in order that he
might assign to each nation its bounds: but an eternal possession, through a
continual succession of ages, was never promised to any nation, as it was to the
posterity of Abraham. In what spirit, then, ought we to dwell in a world, where
no certain repose, or fixed abode is promised us? Moreover, this is described by
Paul as the common condition of all pious persons under the reign of Christ,
that they should "have no certain dwelling-place;"
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 4:11;) not that all should be alike cast out as exiles, but because
the Lord calls all his people, as by the sound of the trumpet, to be wanderers,
lest they should become fixed in their nests on earth. Therefore, whether any
one remains in his own country, or is compelled continually to change his place,
let him diligently exercise himself in the meditation, that he is sojourning,
for a short time, upon earth, till, having completed his course, he shall depart
to the heavenly country.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Few and evil have the days of the
years of my life been</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Jacob may here seem to
complain that he had lived but a little while, and that, in this short space of
time, he had endured many and grievous afflictions. Why does he not rather
recount the great and manifold favors of God which formed an abundant
compensation for every kind of evil? Besides, his complaint respecting the
shortness of life seems unworthy of him; for why did he not deem a whole century
and a third part of another sufficient for him? But if any one will rightly
weigh his words, he rather expresses his own gratitude, in celebrating the
goodness of God towards his fathers. For he does not so much deplore his own
decrepitude, as he extols the vigor divinely afforded to his fathers. Certainly
it was no new and unwonted thing to see a man, at his age, broken down and
failing, and already near to the grave. Wherefore, this comparison (as I have
said) was only intended to ascribe glory to God, whose blessing towards Abraham
and Isaac had been greater than to himself. But he does not compare himself with
his fathers in sufferings, as if they had been treated with greater indulgence;
for we know that they had been tried to the utmost with all kinds of
temptations: he merely states that he had not attained their age; as if he had
said, "I, indeed, have arrived at those years which, by others, is deemed a
mature old age, and which complete the proper term of life; but the Lord so
prolonged the life of my fathers, that they far exceeded this limit." He makes
mention of evil days, in order to show that he was not so much broken down and
consumed by years, as by labors and troubles; as if he had said, "My senses
might yet have flourished in their vigor, if my strength had not been exhausted
by continual labors, by excessive cares, and by most grievous sufferings." We
now see that nothing was less in the mind of the holy man than to expostulate
with God. Yet it may seem absurd that he speaks of his life as being shorter
than that of his fathers. For, whence does he conjecture that so little time
should still remain for him, as to prevent him from attaining their age? Should
any one answer, that he formed this conjecture from the weakness of his body,
which was half dead; the solution will not prove satisfactory. For Isaac had
dimness of sight and trembling limbs thirty years before his death. But it is
not absurd to suppose that Jacob was every moment giving himself over to death,
as if the sepulcher were before his eyes. He was, however, uncertain what length
of time was decreed for him in the secret counsel of God. Wherefore, being
unconcerned about the remainder of his life, he speaks just as if he were about
to die on the next day.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joseph nourished his
father, etc., according to their families</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F638</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Some explain the expression, "the mouth of the little one," as if Joseph
nourished his father and his whole family, in the manner in which food is
conveyed to the mouths of children. These interpreters regard the form of speech
as emphatical, because, during the famine, Jacob and his family had no more
anxiety about the providing of food than children, who cannot even stretch out
their hand to receive it. Others translate it "youth," but I know not with what
meaning. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F639</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Others take it, simply, according to the proportion and number of the little
children. To me the genuine sense seems to be that he fed all, from the greatest
to the least. Therefore, there was sufficient bread for the whole family of
Jacob, because, by the care of Joseph, provision was made to supply nourishment
even to the little ones. In this manner Moses commemorates both the clemency of
God, and the piety of Joseph; for it was an instance of uncommon attention, that
these hungry husband men, who had not a grain of corn, were entirely fed at his
expense.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And all the land of Canaan
fainted</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It was a memorable judgment of God,
that the most fertile regions, which were accustomed to supply provisions for
distant and transmarine nations, were reduced to such poverty that they were
almost consumed. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hhl</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>lahah</i>,) which Moses uses, is explained in two ways. Some say that they
were driven to madness on account of the famine; others, that they were so
destitute of food that they fainted; but whichever method of interpretation be
approved, we see that they who had been accustomed to supply others with food,
were themselves famishing. Therefore it is not for those who cultivate fertile
lands to trust in their abundance; rather let them acknowledge that a large
supply of provision does not so much spring from the bowels of the earth, as it
distills, or rather flows down from heaven, by the secret blessing of God. For
there is no luxuriance so great, that it is not soon exchanged for barrenness,
when God sprinkles it with salt instead of rain. Meanwhile, it is right to turn
our eyes to that special kindness of God by which he nourishes his own people in
the midst of famine, as it is said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;193719&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
37:19. If, however, God is pleased to try us with famine, we must pray that he
would prepare us to endure hunger with a meek and equal mind, lest we should
rage, like fierce, and even ravenous wild beasts. And although it is possible
that grievous commotions were raised during the protracted scarcity, (as it is
said in the old proverb that the belly has no ears,) yet the more simple sense
of the passage seems to me to be, that the Egyptians and Canaanites had sunk
under the famine, and were lying prostrate, as if at the point of death.
Moreover, Moses pursues the history of the famine, with the intention of showing
that the prediction of Joseph was verified by the event; and that, by his skill
and industry, the greatest dangers were so well and dexterously provided
against, that Egypt ought justly to acknowledge him as the author of its
deliverance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joseph gathered up all
the money</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses first declares that the
Egyptian king had acted well and wisely, in committing the work of providing
corn to the sole care and authority of Joseph. He then commends the sincere and
faithful administration of Joseph himself. We know how few persons can touch the
money of kings without defiling themselves by peculation. Amid such vast heaps
of money, the opportunity of plundering was not less than the difficulty of
self-restraint. But Moses says, that whatever money Joseph collected, he brought
into the house of the king. It was a rare and unparalleled integrity, to keep
the hands pure amidst such heaps of gold. And he would not have been able to
conduct himself with such moderation, unless his divine calling had proved as a
bridle to hold him in; for they who are restrained from thefts and rapaciousness
by worldly motives alone, would immediately put forth their hand to the prey,
unless they feared the eyes and the judgments of men. But inasmuch as Joseph
might have sinned without a witness of his fault; it follows that the true fear
of God flourished in his breast. Plausible and well coloured pretexts, in excuse
of the theft, would doubtless present themselves. "When you are serving a
tyrant, why may it not be lawful for you to apply some part of the gain to your
own advantage?" So much the more does it appear that he was fortified by
downright honesty; since he repelled all temptations, lest he should desire
fraudulently to enrich himself at the expense of
another.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when money
failed</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses does not mean that all the money
in Egypt had been brought into the royal treasury; for there were many of the
nobles of the court free from the effects of the famine; but the simple meaning
of the expression is that nearly all had been exhausted; that now the common
people had not money enough to buy corn; and that, at length, extreme necessity
had driven the Egyptians to the second remedy of which he is about to speak.
Moreover, although, like persons driven to desperation, they might seem
arrogantly to rise up against Joseph; yet the context shows that nothing was
farther from their minds than to terrify, by their boldness, the man whose
compassion they suppliantly implore. Wherefore the question<i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why should we die in thy
presence?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> has no other signification than that
they felt themselves ruined, unless his clemency should afford them relief. But
it may be asked how the Canaanites supported their lives. There is indeed no
doubt that a grievous pestilence, the attendant on famine, would carry off many,
unless they received assistance from other regions, or were miserally fed on
herbs and roots. And perhaps the barrenness was not there so great, but that
they might gather half, or a third part of their food, from the
fields,</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Give your
cattle</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It was a miserable spectacle, and one
which might have softened hearts of iron, to see rich farmers, who previously
had kept provision stored in their granaries for others, now begging food.
Therefore, Joseph might be deemed cruel, because he does not give bread
gratuitously to those who are poor and exhausted, but robs them of all their
cattle, sheep, and asses. Seeing, however, that Joseph is transacting the
business of another, I dare not charge his strictness with cruelty. If, during
the seven fruitful years, he had extorted corn by force from an unwilling
people, he would now have acted tyrannically in seizing their flocks and herds.
But seeing that they had been at liberty to lay up, in their private stores,
what they had sold to the king, they now pay the just penalty of their
negligence. Joseph also perceived that they were deprived of their possessions
by a divine interposition, in order that the king alone might be enriched by the
spoils of all. Besides, since it was lawful for him to offer corn for sale, it
was also lawful for him to exchange it for cattle. Truly, the corn belonged to
the king; why then should he not demand a price from the purchasers? But they
were poor, and therefore it was but just to succor them in their want. Were this
rule to prevail, the greater part of sales would be unlawful. For no one freely
parts with what he possesses. Wherefore, if his valuation of the cattle was
fair, I do not see what was deserving of reprehension in the conduct of Joseph;
especially as he was not dealing with his own property, but had been appointed
prefect over the corn, with this condition, that he should acquire gain, not for
himself, but for the king. If any one should object that he ought at least to
have exhorted the lying to content himself with the abundant pecuniary wealth
which he had obtained; I answer, that Moses relates, by the way, but a few
things out of many. Any one, therefore, may easily conjecture, that a business
of such great consequence, was not transacted by Joseph, without the cognizance
and judgment of the king. But what, if it appeared to the king's counselors, an
equitable arrangement, that the farmers should receive, in return for their
cattle, food for the whole year? Lastly, seeing that we stand or fall by the
judgment of God alone, it is not for us to condemn what his law has left
undecided.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They came to him the second
year</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses does not reckon the second year
from the date of the famine, but from the time when the money had failed. But
since they knew, from the oracle, that the termination of the dearth was drawing
near, they desired not only that corn should be given them for food, but also
for seed. Whence it appears that they had become wise too late, and had
neglected the useful admonition of God, at the time when they ought to have made
provision for the future. Moreover, when they declare that their money and
cattle had failed, they do it, not for the purpose of expostulating with Joseph,
as if they had been unjustly deprived of these things by him; but for the
purpose of showing that the only thing remaining for them was to purchase food
and seed at the price of their lands, and that they could not otherwise be
preserved, unless Joseph would enter into this compact. For it would have been
the part of impudence to offer no price or compensation. They begin by saying,
that they had nothing at hand, and that, therefore, their lives would be lost,
unless Joseph were willing to buy their lands; and in order to excite his
compassion, they ask again, why he would suffer them to die, and their very land
to perish? For this is the death of the earth, when the cultivation of it is
neglected, and when, being reduced to a desert, it can bring forth nothing
more.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joseph bought all the
land</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Any one might suppose it to be the height
of cruel and inexplicable avarice, that Joseph should take away from the
miserable husband men, the very fields, by the produce of which they nourished
the kingdom. But I have before showed, that unless every kind of purchase is to
be condemned, there is no reason why Joseph should be blamed. If any one should
say that he abused their penury; this alone would suffice for his excuse, that
no wiles of his, no circumvention, no force, no threats, had reduced the
Egyptians to this necessity. He transacted the king's business with equal
fidelity and industry; and fulfilled the duties of his office, without resorting
to violent edicts. When the famine became urgent, it was lawful to expose wheat
to sale, as well to the rich as to the poor: afterwards it was not less lawful
to buy the cattle; and now, at last, why should it not be lawful to acquire the
land for the king, at a just price? To this may be added, that he extorted
nothing, but entered into treaty with them, at their own request. I confess,
indeed, that it is not right to take whatever may be offered without
discrimination: for if severe necessity presses, then he who wishes, by all
means, to escape it, will submit to hard conditions. Therefore, when any one
thus invites us, to defraud him, we are not, by his necessities, rendered
excusable. But I do not defend Joseph, on this sole ground, that the Egyptians
voluntarily offered him their lands, as men who were ready to purchase life, at
any price; but I say, this ought also to be considered, that he acted with
equity, even though he left them nothing. The terms would have been more severe,
if they themselves had been consigned to perpetual slavery; but he now concedes
to them personal liberty, and only covenants for their fields, which, perhaps,
the greater part of the people had bought from the poor. If he had stripped of
their clothing those whom he was feeding with corn, this would have been to put
them indirectly and slowly to death. For what difference does it make, whether I
compel a man to die by hunger or by cold? But Joseph so succors the Egyptians,
that in future they should be free, and should be able to obtain a moderate
subsistence by their labor. For though they might have to change their abode,
yet they are all made stewards of the king: and Joseph restores to them, not
only the lands, but the implements which he had bought. Whence it appears that
he had used what clemency he was able, in order to relieve them. Meanwhile, let
those who are too intent on wealth beware lest they should falsely employ
Joseph's example as a pretext: because it is certain that all contracts, which
are not formed according to the rule of charity, are vicious in the sight of
God; and that we ought, according to that equity which is inwardly dictated to
us by a secret instinct of nature, so to act towards others, as we wish to be
dealt with ourselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And as for the people, he
removed them to cities</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This removal was,
indeed, severe; but if we reflect how much better it was to depart to another
place; in order that they might be free cultivators of the land, than to be
attached to the soil, and employed as slaves in servile work; no one will deny
that this was a tolerable, and even a humane exercise of authority. Had each
person cultivated his field, as he had been accustomed to do, the exaction of
tribute would have seemed to be grievous. Joseph, therefore, contrived a middle
course, which might mitigate the new and unwonted burden, by assigning new lands
to each, with a tribute attached to them. The passage may, however, be
differently expounded; namely, that Joseph caused all the farmers to go to the
cities to receive the provisions, and to settle their public accounts. If this
sense is approved, the fact that Egypt was divided into provinces, afterwards
called <i>nomes</i>, may probably hence have received its origin. This removing
from place to place would, however, have been alike injurious to the king and to
the people at large, because they would not be able to make their skill and
practice applicable to new situations. Yet, since the matter is not of great
moment, and the signification of the word is ambiguous, I leave the question
undecided.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Only the land of the
priests</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The priests were exempted from the
common law, because the king granted them a maintenance. It is, indeed,
doubtful, whether this was a supply for their present necessity, or whether he
was accustomed to nourish them at his own expense. But seeing that Moses makes
mention of their lands, I rattler incline to the conjecture, that, whereas they
had before been rich, and this dearth had deprived them of their income, the
king conferred this privilege upon them; and hence it arose that their lands
remained unto them free. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F640</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The ancient historians, however, injudiciously invent many fables concerning the
state of that land. I know not whether the statement that the farmers, content
with small wages, sow and reap for the king and the priests, is to be traced to
this regulation of Joseph or not. But, passing by these things, it is more to
the purpose to observe, what Moses wished distinctly to testify; namely, that a
heathen king paid particular attention to Divine worship, in supporting the
priests gratuitously, for the purpose of sparing their lands and their property.
Truly this is placed before our eyes, as a mirror, in which we may discern that
a sentiment of piety which they cannot wholly efface, is implanted in the minds
of men. It was the part of foolish, as well as of wicked superstition, that
Pharaoh nourished such priests as these, who infatuated the people by their
impostures: yet this was, in itself, a design worthy of commendation, that he
did not suffer the worship of God to fall into decay; which, in a short time,
must have happened, if the priests had perished in the famine. Whence we infer
how sedulously we ought to be on our guard, that we undertake nothing with an
indiscreet zeal; because nothing is more easy, in so great a corruption of human
nature, than for religion to degenerate into frivolous trifles. Nevertheless,
because this inconsiderate devotion (as it may be called) flowed from a right
principle, what should be the conduct of our princes, who desire to be deemed
Christians? If Pharaoh was so solicitous about his priests, that he nourished
them to his own destruction, and that of his whole kingdom, in order that he
might not be guilty of impiety against false gods; what sacrilege is it, in
Christian princes, that the lawful and sincere ministers of holy things should
be neglected, whose work they know to be approved by God, and salutary to
themselves? But it may be asked, whether it was lawful for holy Joseph to
undertake this office, for by so doing, he employed his labor in cherishing
impious superstitions? But though I can readily grant that in such great, and
arduous, and manifold offices of trust, it was easy for him to slide into
various faults; yet I dare not absolutely condemn this act; nor can I, however,
deny that he may have erred, in not resisting these superstitions with
sufficient boldness. But since he was required by no law, to destroy the priests
by hunger, and was not altogether allowed to dispense the king's corn at his own
pleasure; if the king wished that food should be gratuitously supplied to the
priests, he was no more at liberty to deny it to them than to the nobles at
court. Therefore, though he did not willingly take charge of such dependents,
yet when the king imposed the duty upon him, he could not refuse it, though he
knew them to be unworthy to be fed on the dirt of
oxen.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then Joseph said unto the
people</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here Moses describes the singular
humanity of Joseph, which, as it then repressed all complaints, so, at this
time, it justly dispels and refutes the calumnies with which he is assailed. The
men, who were entirely destitute, and, in a sense, exiles, he reinstates in
their possessions, on the most equitable condition, that they should pay a fifth
part of the produce to the king. It is well known that formerly, in various
places, kings have demanded by law the payment of tenths; but that, in the time
of war, they doubled this tax. Therefore, what injury, can we say, was done to
the Egyptians, when Joseph burdened the land, bought for the king, with a fifth
part of its income; especially seeing that country is so much richer than
others, that with less labor than elsewhere, it brings forth fruit for the
maintenance of its cultivators? Should any one object that the king would have
acted more frankly had he taken the fifth part of the land; the answer is
obvious, that this was useful not only as an example, but also, for the purpose
of quieting the people, by shutting the mouths of the captious. And certainly
this indirect method, by which Joseph introduced the tax of a fifth part, had no
other object than that of inducing the Egyptians to cultivate their lands with
more alacrity, when they were convinced that, by such a compact, they were
treated with clemency. And to this effect was their confession, which is
recorded by Moses, expressed. For, first, they acknowledge that they owe their
lives to him; secondly, they do not refuse to be the servants of the king.
Whence we gather, that the holy man so conducted himself between the two
parties, as greatly to enrich the king, without oppressing the people by
tyranny. And I wish that all governors would practice this moderation, that they
would only so far study the advantage of kings, as could be done without injury
to the people. There is a celebrated saying of Tiberius Caesar, which savored
little of tyranny, though he appears to have been a sanguinary and insatiable
tyrant, that it is the part of a shepherd to shear the flock, but not to tear
off the skin. At this day, however, kings do not believe that they rule freely,
unless they not only flay their subjects, but entirely devour them. For they do
not generally invest any with authority, except those who are sworn to the
practice of slaughter. So much the more does the clemency of Joseph deserve
praise, who so administered the affairs of Egypt, as to render the immense gains
of the king compatible with a tolerable condition of the
people.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Israel dwelt in the
land</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses does not mean that Jacob and his
sons were proprietors of that land which Pharaoh had granted them as a
dwelling-place, in the same manner in which the other parts of Egypt were given
to the inhabitants for a perpetual possession: but that they dwelt there
commodiously for a time, and thus were in possession by favor, provided they
continued to be peaceable. Hence the cause that they so greatly increased, in a
very short space of time. Therefore, what is here related by Moses belongs to
the history of the following period; and he now returns to the proper thread of
his narrative, in which he purposed to show how God protected his Church from
many deaths; and not that only, but wonderfully exalted it by his own secret
power.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob
lived</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It was no common source of temptation to
the holy old man, to be an exile from the land of Canaan, for so many years. Be
it so, that on account of the famine, he was compelled to go to Egypt; why could
he not return when the fifth year was passed? For he did not stupidly lie there
in a state of torpor, but he remained quiet, because free egress was not allowed
him. Wherefore, also, in this respect, God did not lightly exercise his
patience. For, however sweet might be the delights of Egypt, yet he was more
than miserable to be deprived of the sight of that land which was the lively
figure of his celestial country. With the men of this world, indeed, earthly
advantage would have prevailed: but such was the piety of the holy man, that the
profit of the flesh weighed nothing against the loss of spiritual good. But he
was more deeply wounded, when he saw his death approaching: because, not only
was he himself deprived of the inheritance promised to him, but he was leaving
his sons, of doubtful, or at least of feeble, faith, buried in Egypt as in a
sepulcher. Moreover, his example is proposed to us, that our minds may not
languish or become enfeebled by the weariness of a protracted warfare: yea, the
more Satan attempts to depress it}em to the earth, the more fervently let them
look and soar towards heaven.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he called his son
Joseph</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Hence we infer, not only the anxiety of
Jacob, but his invincible magnanimity. It is a proof of great courage, that none
of the wealth or the pleasures of Egypt could so allure him, as to prevent him
from sighing for the land of Canaan, in which he had always passed a painful and
laborious life. But the constancy of his faith appeared still more excellent,
when he, commanding his dead body to be carried back to Canaan, encouraged his
sons to hope for deliverance. Thus it happened that he, being dead, animated
those who were alive and remained, as with the sound of a trumpet. For, to what
purpose was this great care respecting his sepulture, except that the promise of
God might be confirmed to his posterity? Therefore, though his faith was tossed
as upon the waves, yet it was so far from suffering shipwreck, that it conducted
others into the haven. Moreover, he demands an oath from his son Joseph, not so
much on account of distrust, as to show that a matter of the greatest
consequence was in hand. Certainly he would not, by lightly swearing, profane
the name of God: but the more sacred and solemn the promise was, the more ought
all his sons to remember, that it was of great importance that his body should
be carried to the sepulcher of his fathers. It is also probable that he
prudently thought of alleviating any enmity which might be excited against his
son Joseph. For he knew that this choice of his sepulcher would be, by no means,
gratifying to the Egyptians; seeing it seemed like casting a reproach on their
whole kingdom. This stranger, forsooth, as if he could find no fit place for his
body in this splendid and noble country, wishes to be buried in the land of
Canaan. Therefore, in order that Joseph might more freely dare to ask, and might
more easily obtain, this favor from the king, Jacob binds him by an oath. And
certainly Joseph afterwards makes use of this pretext, to avoid giving offense.
This also was the reason why he required Joseph to do for him that last office,
which was a duty devolving on the brothers in common; for such a favor would
scarcely have been granted to the rest; and they would not have ventured on the
act, unless permission had been obtained. But, as strangers and mean men, they
had neither favor nor authority. Besides, it was especially necessary for Joseph
to be on his guard, lest becoming ensnared by the allurements of Egypt, he
should gradually forsake his own kindred. It must, however, be known, that the
solemnity of an oath was designedly interposed by Jacob, to show that he did
not, in vain, desire for himself, a sepulcher in the land where he had met with
an unfavorable reception; where he had endured many sufferings; and from which,
at length, being expelled by hunger, he had become an exile. As to his
commanding the hand to be put under his thigh, we have explained what this
symbol means in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;012402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
24:2.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.

fathers</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F641</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It appears from this passage, that the word "sleep," whenever it is put for
"die", does not refer to the soul, but to the body. For, what did it concern
him, to be buried with his fathers in the double cave, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F642</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
unless to testify that he was associated with them after death? And by what bond
were he and they joined together, except this, that not even death itself could
extinguish the power of their faith; which would seem to utter this voice from
the same sepulcher, Now also we have a common
inheritance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Israel bowed himself upon
the bed's head</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By this expression, Moses again
affirms that Jacob esteemed it a singular kindness, that his son should have
promised to do what he had required respecting his burial. For he exerts his
weak body as much as he is able, in order to give thanks unto God, as if he had
obtained something most desirable. He is said to have worshipped towards the
head of his bed: because, seeing he was quite unable to rise from the bed on
which he lay, he yet composed himself with a solemn air in the attitude of one
who was praying. The same is recorded of David
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;110147&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 1:47) when, having obtained his last wish, he celebrates the grace of God.
The Greeks have translated it, at the top of his staff: which the Apostle has
followed in the Epistle to the Hebrews,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581121&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:21.) And though the interpreters seem to have been deceived by the similitude
of words; because, with the Hebrews,

(<i>mitah</i>) signifies "bed,"
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hfwm</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>motah</i>,) "a staff;" yet the Apostle allows himself to cite the passage as
it was then commonly used, lest he might offend unskillful readers, without
necessity. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F643</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Moreover, they who expound the words to mean that Jacob worshipped the scepter
of his son, absurdly trifle. The exposition of others, that he bowed his head,
leaning on the top of his staff, is, to say the least, tolerable. But since
there is no ambiguity in the words of Moses, let it suffice to keep in memory
what I have said, that, by this ceremony, he openly manifested the greatness of
his joy.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">CHAPTER

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>After these
things</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses now passes to the last act of
Jacob's life, which, as we shall see, was especially worthy of remembrance. For,
since he knew that he was invested by God with no common character, in being
made the father of the fathers of the Church, he fulfilled, in the immediate
prospect of death, the prophetic office, respecting the future state of the
Church, which had been enjoined upon him. Private persons arrange their domestic
affairs by their last wills; but very different was the method pursued by this
holy man, with whom God had established his covenant, with this annexed
condition, that the succession of grace should flow down to his posterity. But
before I enter fully on the consideration of this subject, these two things are
to be observed, to which Moses briefly alludes: first, that Joseph, being
informed of his father's sickness, immediately went to see him; and, secondly,
that Jacob, having heard of his arrival, attempted to raise his feeble and
trembling body, for the sake of doing him honor. Certainly, the reason why
Joseph was so desirous of seeing his father, and so prompt to discharge all the
other duties of filial piety, was, that he regarded it as a greater privilege to
be a son of Jacob, than to preside over a hundred kingdoms. For, in bringing his
sons with him, he acted as if he would emancipate them from the country in which
they had been born, and restore them to their own stock. For they could not be
reckoned among the progeny of Abraham, without rendering themselves detested by
the Egyptians. Nevertheless, Joseph prefers that reproach for them, to every
kind of wealth and glory, if they may but become one with the sacred body of the
Church. His father, however, rising before him, pays him becoming honor, for the
kindness received at his hand. Meanwhile, by so doing, he fulfils his part in
the prediction, which before had inflamed his sons with rage; lest his
constituting Ephraim and Manasseh the heads of two tribes, should seem grievous
and offensive to his sons.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jacob said unto
Joseph</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The design of the holy man was to
withdraw his son from the wealth and honors of Egypt, and to reunite him to the
holy race, from which he had been, for a little while, separated. Moreover, he
neither proudly boasts of his own excellence, nor of his present riches, nor of
his power, for the sake of inducing his son to comply with his wishes; but
simply sets before him the covenant of God. So also it is right, that the grace
of adoption, as soon as it is offered to us, should, by filling our thoughts,
extinguish our desire for everything splendid and costly in the world. This
passage is, doubtless, remarkable. Joseph was possessed of the most exalted
dignity; he foresees that the most excellent nobility would pass, through the
memory of his name, to his posterity: he is able to leave them an ample
patrimony: nor would it be difficult so to advance them in royal favor, that
they might obtain rank among the nobles of the kingdom. Too many examples show
how easy it is not only to be caught, but altogether fascinated, by such
allurements. Yea, the greater part know, by their own experience, that, as soon
as the least ray of hope beams upon us, from the world, we are torn away from
the Lord, and alienated from the pursuit of the heavenly life. If a very few
drops thus inebriate our flesh, how dangerous is it to drink from the full bowl?
But to all the riches and honors of Egypt, Jacob opposes the vision in which God
had adopted himself and his race, as his own people. Whenever, therefore, Satan
shall try to entangle us with the allurements of the world, that he may draw us
away from heaven, let us remember for what end we are called; in order that, in
comparison with the inestimable treasure of eternal life, all that the flesh
would otherwise prefer, may become loathsome. For, if holy Joseph formerly held
an obscure vision in such esteem, that, for this sole object, forgetting Egypt,
he gladly passed over to the despised flock of the Church; how shameful, at this
day, is our folly, how vile our stupor, how detestable our ingratitude, if, at
least, we are not equally affected, when our heavenly Father, having opened the
gate of his kingdom, with unutterable sweetness invites us to himself? At the
same time, however, we must observe, that holy Jacob does not obtrude vain
imaginations, for the purpose of alluring his son; but places before him the
sure promise of God, on which he may safely rely. Whence we are taught, that our
faith is not rightly founded on anything except the sole word of God; and also,
that this is a sufficiently firm support of faith, to prevent it from ever being
shaken or overthrown by any devices whatever. Wherefore, whenever Satan attempts
to draw us hither and thither by his enticements, let us learn to turn our minds
to the word of God, and so firmly to rely upon its hidden blessings, that, with
a lofty spirit, we may spurn those things which the flesh now sees and touches.
Jacob says that God appeared to him in the land of Canaan, in order that Joseph,
aspiring after that land, might become alienated in the affection of his heart
from the kingdom of Egypt.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
blessed me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In this place the word blessed does
not signify the present effect or manifestation of a happy life, in the way in
which the Lord is sometimes said to bless his people, when he indeed declares,
by the favor with which he follows them, that he openly makes them happy,
because they are received under his protection. But Jacob regards himself as
blessed, because he, having embraced the grace promised to him, does not doubt
of its effect. And, therefore, I take what immediately follows; namely,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will make thee
fruitful</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc</i>., as explanatory of what
precedes. Now the Lord promised that he would cause an assembly of nations to
descend from him: because thirteen tribes, of which the whole body of the nation
consisted, were, in a sense, so many nations. But since this was nothing more
than a prelude to that greatness which should afterwards follow, when God,
having scattered seed over the whole world, should gather together a church for
himself, out of all nations; we may, while we recognize the accomplishment of
the benediction under the old dispensation, yet allow that it refers to
something greater. When therefore the people increased to so great a multitude,
and thirteen populous tribes flowed from the twelve patriarchs, Jacob began
already to grow to an assembly of nations. But from the time that the spiritual
Israel was diffused through all quarters of the world, and various nations were
congregated into one Church, this multiplication tended towards its completion.
Wherefore, it is no wonder that holy Jacob should so highly estimate this most
distinguished mark of divine favor, though, indeed, it was deeply hidden from
carnal perception. But inasmuch as the Lord had held him long in suspense,
profane men have said, that the old man was in his dotage. Few indeed are to be
found, in this age, like Joseph, who disregarding the enjoyment of pleasures
which are at hand, yield entire submission to the plain declaration of God's
word. But as Jacob, relying in confidence on invisible grace, had overcome every
kind of temptation: so now his son, and the true heir of his faith, regards with
reverence the oracles of the Lord; esteeming more highly the promise which he
was persuaded had come down from heaven, though it was in the form of a dream,
than all the riches of Egypt which he
enjoyed.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For an everlasting
possession</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We have elsewhere shown the meaning
of this expression: namely, that the Israelites should be perpetual heirs of the
land until the coming of Christ, by which the world was renewed. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;lw[</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>olam</i>) is by some taken merely for <i>a long time</i>, by others for
<i>eternity</i>: but seeing that Christ prolongs, to the end of time, the grace
which was previously shadowed forth to the patriarchs; the phrase, in my
judgment, refers to eternity. For that portion of land was promised to the
ancient people of God, until the renovation introduced by Christ: and now, ever
since the Lord has assigned the whole world to his people, a fuller fruition of
the inheritance belongs to us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And now thy two
sons</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Jacob confers on his son the special
privilege, that he, being one, should constitute two chiefs; that is, that his
two sons should succeed to an equal right with their uncles, as if they had been
heirs in the first degree. But what is this! that a decrepit old man assigns to
his grandchildren, as a royal patrimony, a sixth part of the land in which he
had entered as a stranger, and from which now again he is an exile! Who would
not have said that he was dealing in fables? It is a common proverb, that no one
can give what he has not. What, therefore, did it profit Joseph to be
constituted, by an imaginary title, lord of that land, in which the donor of it
was scarcely permitted to drink the very water he had dug for with greatlabour,
and from which, at length, famine expelled him? But it hence appears with what
firm faith the holy fathers relied upon the word of the Lord, seeing they chose
rather to depend upon his lips, than to possess a fixed habitation in the land.
Jacob is dying an exile in Egypt; and meanwhile, calls away the governor of
Egypt from his dignity into exile, that he may be well and happy. Joseph,
because he acknowledges his father as a prophet of God, who utters no inventions
of his own, esteems as highly the dominion offered to him, which has never yet
become apparent, as if it were already in his possession. Moreover, that Jacob
commands the other sons of Joseph, (if there should be any,) to be reckoned in
the families of these two brothers, is as if he directed them to be adopted by
the two whom he adopts to himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And as for me, when I came from
Padan</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He mentions the death and burial of his
wife Rachel, in order that the name of his mother might prove a stimulus to the
mind of Joseph. For since all the sons of Jacob had sprung from Syria, it was
not a little to the purpose, that they should be thoroughly acquainted with the
history which we have before considered, namely, that their father, returning
into the land of Canaan, by the command and under the protection of God, brought
his wives with him. For if it was not grievous to women, to leave their father,
and to journey into a distant land, their example ought to be no slight
inducement to their sons to bid farewell to Egypt; and at the command of the
same God, strenuously prepare themselves for taking possession of the land of
Canaan.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Israel beheld Joseph's
sons</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I have no doubt that he had inquired
concerning the youths, before he called them his heirs. But in the narration of
Moses there is a <i>hysteron proteron</i>. And in the answer of Joseph we
observe, what we have elsewhere alluded to, that the fruit of the womb is not
born by chance, but is to be reckoned among the precious gifts of God. This
confession indeed finds a ready utterance from the tongues of all; but there are
few who heartily acknowledge that their seed has been given them by God. And
hence a large proportion of man's offspring becomes continually more and more
degenerate: because the ingratitude of the world renders it unable to perceive
the effect of the blessings of God. We must now briefly consider the design of
Moses: which was to show that a solemn symbol was interposed, by which the
adoption might be ratified. Jacob puts his hands upon his grandsons; for what
end? Truly to prove that he gave them a place among his sons: and thus
constitutes Joseph who was <i>one</i>, into two <i>chiefs</i>. For this was not
his wish as a private person; according to the manner in which fathers and
grandfathers are wont to pray for prosperity to their descendants: but a divine
authority suggested it, as was afterwards proved by the event. Therefore he
commands them to be brought near to him, that he might confer on them a new
honor, as if he had been appointed the dispenser of it by the Lord; and Joseph,
on the other hand, begins with adoration, giving thanks to
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joseph brought them
out</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses explains more fully what he had
touched upon in a single word. Joseph brings forth his sons from his own lap to
his father's knees, not only for the sake of honor, but that he may present them
to receive a blessing from the prophet of God; for he was certainly persuaded,
that holy Jacob did not desire to embrace his grandsons after the common manner
of men; but inasmuch as he was the interpreter of God, he wished to impart to
them the blessing deposited with himself. And although, in dividing the land of
Canaan, he assigned them equal portions with his sons, yet the imposition of his
hands had respect to something higher; namely, that they should be two of the
patriarchs of the Church, and should hold an honorable preeminence in the
spiritual kingdom of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Israel stretched out his
right hand</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Seeing his eyes were dim with age,
so that he could not, by looking, discern which was the elder, he yet
intentionally placed his hands across. And therefore Moses says that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>guided his hands
wittingly</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because he did not rashly put them
forth, nor transfer them from one youth to the other for the sake of feeling
them: but using judgment, he purposely directed his right hand to Ephraim who
was the younger: but placed his left hand on the first-born. Whence we gather
that the Holy Spirit was the director of this act, who irradiated the mind of
the holy man, and caused him to see more correctly, than those who were the most
clear-sighted, into the nature of this symbolical act. I shall avoid saying
more, because we shall be able to inquire into it from other
passages.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God before
whom</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Although Jacob knew that a dispensation
of the grace of God was committed to him, in order that he might effectual)y
bless his grandchildren; yet he arrogates nothing to himself, but suppliantly
resorts to prayer, lest he should, in the least degree, detract from the glory
of God. For as he was the legitimate administrator of the blessing, so it
behaved him to acknowledge God as its sole Author. And hence a common rule is to
be deduced for all the ministers and pastors of the Church. For though they are
not only called witnesses of celestial grace, but are also entrusted with the
dispensation of spiritual gifts; yet when they are compared with God, they are
nothing; because he alone contains all things within himself. Wherefore let them
learn willingly to keep their own place, lest they should obscure the name of
God. And truly, since the Lord, by no means, appoints his ministers, with the
intention of derogating from his own power; therefore, mortal man cannot,
without sacrilege, desire to seem anything separate from God. In the words of
Jacob we must note, first, that he invokes God, in whose sight his fathers
Abraham and Isaac had walked: for since the blessing depended upon the covenant
entered into with them, it was necessary that their faith should be an
intervening link between them and their descendants. God had chosen them and
their posterity for a people unto himself: but the promise was efficacious for
this reason, because, being apprehended by faith, it had taken a lively root.
And thus it came to pass, that they transmitted the light of succession to Jacob
himself. We now see that he does not bring forward, in vain, or unseasonably,
that faith of the fathers, without which he would not have been a legitimate
successor of grace, by the covenant of God: not that Abraham and Isaac had
acquired so great an honor for themselves, and their posterity; or were, in
themselves, so excellent; but because the Lord seals and sanctions by faith,
those benefits which he promises us, so that they shall not
fail.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The God which fed
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Jacob now descends to his own feelings, and
states that from his youth he had constantly experienced, in various ways, the
divine favor towards him. He had before made the knowledge of God received
through his word, and the faith of his fathers, the basis of the blessing he
pronounces; he now adds another confirmation from experience itself; as if he
would say, that he was not pronouncing a blessing which consisted in an empty
sound of words, but one of which he had himself enjoyed the fruit, all his life
long. Now though God causes his sun to shine indiscriminately on the good and
evil, and feeds unbelievers as well as believers: yet because he affords, only
to the latter, the peculiar sense of his paternal love in the use of his gifts,
Jacob rightly uses this as a reason for the confirmation of his faith, that he
had always been protected by the help of God. Unbelievers are fed, even to the
full, by the liberality of God: but they gorge themselves, like swine, which,
while acorns are falling for them from the trees, yet have their snouts fixed to
the earth. But in God's benefits this is the principal thing, that they are
pledges or tokens of his paternal love towards us. Jacob, therefore, from the
sense of piety, with which the children of God are endued, rightly adduces, as
proof of the promised grace, whatever good things God had bestowed upon him; as
if he would say, that he himself was a decisive example to show how truly and
faithfully the Lord had engaged by covenant to be a father to the children of
Abraham. Let us also learn hence, carefully to consider and meditate upon
whatever benefits we receive from the hand of God, that they may prove so many
supports for the confirmation of our faith. The best method of seeking God is to
begin at his word; after this, (if I may so speak,) experimental knowledge is
added. Now whereas, in this place, the singular gratitude of the holy man is
conspicuous; yet this circumstance adds to his honor, that, while involved in
manifold sufferings, by which he was almost borne down, he celebrates the
continual goodness of God. For although, by the rare and wonderful power of God,
he had been, in an extraordinary manner, delivered from many dangers; yet it was
a mark of an exalted and courageous mind, to be able to surmount so many and so
great obstacles, to fly on the wings of faith to the goodness of God, and
instead of being overwhelmed by a mass of evils, to perceive the same goodness
in the thickest darkness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Angel which redeemed
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He so joins the Angel to God as to make him
his equal. Truly he offers him divine worship, and asks the same things from him
as from God. If this be understood indifferently of any angel what ever, the
sentence is absurd. Nay, rather, as Jacob himself sustains the name and
character of God, in blessing his son, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F644</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he is superior, in this respect, to the angels. Wherefore it is necessary that
Christ should be here meant, who does not bear in vain the title of Angel,
because he had become the perpetual Mediator. And Paul testifies that he was the
Leader and Guide of the journey of his ancient people.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;461004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 10:4.) He had not yet indeed been sent by the Father, to approach
more nearly to us by taking our flesh, but because he was always the bond of
connection between God and man, and because God formally manifested himself in
no other way than through him, he is properly called the Angel. To which may be
added, that the faith of the fathers was always fixed on his future mission. He
was therefore the Angel, because even then he poured forth his rays, that the
saints might approach God, through him, as Mediator. For there was always so
wide a distance between God and men, that, without a mediator; there could be no
communication. Nevertheless though Christ appeared in the form of an angel, we
must remember what the Apostle says to the Hebrews,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;580216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
2:16,) that "he took not on him the nature of angels," so as to become one of
<i>them</i>, in the manner in which he truly became <i>man</i>; for even when
angels put on human bodies, they did not, on that account, become men. Now since
we are taught, in these words, that the peculiar office of Christ is to defend
us and to deliver us from all evil, let us take heed not to bury this grace in
impious oblivion: yea, seeing that now it is more clearly exhibited to us, than
formerly to the saints under the law, since Christ openly declares that the
faithful are committed to his care, that not one of them might perish,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;431712&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
17:12,) so much the more ought it to flourish in our hearts, both that it may be
highly celebrated by us with suitable praise, and that it may stir us up to seek
this guardianship of our best Protector. And this is exceedingly necessary for
us; for if we reflect how many dangers surround us, that we scarcely pass a day
without being delivered from a thousand deaths; whence does this arise, except
from that care which is taken of us, by the Son of God, who has received us
under his protection, from the hand of his
Father.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And let my name be
named on them</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is a mark of the adoption
before mentioned: for he puts his name upon them, that they may obtain a place
among the patriarchs. Indeed the Hebrew phrase signifies nothing else than to be
reckoned among the family of Jacob. Thus the name of the husband is said to be
called upon the wife,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;230401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
4:1,) because the wife borrows the name from the head to which she is subject.
So much the more ridiculous is the ignorance of the Papists, who would prove
hence that the dead are to be invoked in prayers. Jacob, say they, desired after
his death to be invoked by his posterity. What! that being prayed to, he might
bring them succor; and not &#8212; according to the plain intention of the
speaker &#8212; that Ephraim and Manasseh might be added to the society of the
patriarchs, to constitute two tribes of the holy people! Moreover it is
wonderful, that the Papists, leaving under this pretext framed for themselves
innumerable patrons, should have passed over Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as
unworthy of the office. But the Lord, by this brutish stupor, has avenged their
impious profanation of his name. What Jacob adds in the next clause, namely,
that they should <i>grow into a multitude</i>, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F645</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
refers also to the same promise. The sum amounts to this, that the Lord would
complete in them, what he had promised to the
patriarchs.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when Joseph
saw</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Because by crossing his arms, Jacob had so
placed his hands as to put his left hand upon the head of the first-born, Joseph
wished to correct this proceeding, as if it had been a mistake. He thought that
the error arose from dimness of vision; but his father followed the Spirit of
God as his secret guide, in order that he might transfer the title of honor,
which nature had conferred upon the elder to the younger. For, as he did not
rashly assume to himself the office of conveying the blessing; so was it not
lawful for him to attempt anything according to his own will. And at length it
was evident by the event, that whatever he had done had been dictated to him
from heaven. Whereas Joseph took it amiss, that Manasseh, who by the right of
nature was first, should be cast down to the second place, this feeling arose
from faith and from holy reverence for the prophetic office. For he would easily
have borne to see him make a mistake in the order of embracing the youths; if he
had not known that his father; as a minister of divine grace, so far from acting
a futile part, was but pronouncing on earth what God would ratify in heaven. Yet
he errs in binding the grace of God to the accustomed order of nature: as if the
Lord did not often purposely change the law of nature, to teach us that what he
freely confers upon us, is entirely the result of his own will. If God were
rendering to every one his due, a certain rule might properly be applied to the
distribution of his favors; but since he owes no one anything, he is free to
confer gifts at his own pleasure. More especially, lest any one should glory in
the flesh, he designedly illustrates his own free mercy, in choosing those who
had no worthiness of their own. What shall we say was the cause, why he raised
Ephraim above his own brother, to whom, according to usage, he was inferior? If
any one should suppose that Ephraim had some hidden seed of excellence, he not
only vainly trifles, but impiously perverts the counsel of God. For since God
derives from himself and from his own liberality, the cause, why he prefers one
of the two to the other: he confers the honor upon the younger, for the purpose
of showing that he is bound by no claims of human merit; but that he distributes
his gifts freely, as it seems good unto him. And while this liberty of God is
extended to every kind of good, it yet shines the most clearly in the first
adoption, whereby he predestinates to himself, those whom he sees fit, out of
the ruined mass. Wherefore, be it our part to leave to God his whole power
untouched, and if at any time, our carnal sense rebels, let us know that none
are more truly wise than they who are willing to account themselves blind, when
contemplating the wonderful dealings of God, in order that they may trace the
cause of any difference he makes, to <i>himself</i> alone. We have seen above,
that the eyes of Jacob were dim: but in crossing his arms, with apparent
negligence, in order to comply with God's purpose of election, he is more
clear-sighted than his son Joseph, who, according to the sense of the flesh,
inquires with too much acuteness. They who insanely imagine that this judgment
was formed from a view of their works, sufficiently declare, by this one thing,
that they do not hold the first rudiments of faith. For either the adoption
common both to Manasseh and to Ephraim, was a free gift, or a reward of debt.
Concerning this second supposition all ambiguity is removed, by many passages of
Scripture, in which the Lord makes known his goodness, in having freely loved
and chosen his people. Now no one is so ignorant; as not to perceive that the
first place is not assigned to one or the other, according to merit; but is
given gratuitously, since it so pleases the Lord. With regard to the posture of
the hands, the subtlety of certain persons, who conjecture that the mystery of
the cross was included in it, is absurd; for the Lord intended nothing more than
that the crossing of the right hand and the left should indicate a change in the
accustomed order of nature.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He also shall become a
people</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Jacob does not dispute which of the
youths shall be the more worthy; but only pronounces what God had decreed with
himself, concerning each, and, what would take place after a long succession of
time. He seeks, therefore, no causes elsewhere; but contents himself with this
one statement, that Ephraim will be more greatly multiplied than Manasseh. And
truly our dignity is hidden in the counsel of God alone, until, by his vocation,
he makes it manifest what he wills to do with us. Meanwhile, sinful emulation is
forbidden, when he commands Manasseh to be contented with his lot. They are
therefore altogether insane, who hew out dry and perforated cisterns, in seeking
causes of divine adoption; whereas, everywhere, the Scripture defines in one
word, that they are called to salvation whom God has chosen,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;450829&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:29,) and that the primary source of election is his free good pleasure. The
form of the benediction, which is shortly afterwards related, more fully
confirms what I have alluded to, that the grace of God towards both is
commended, in order that Manasseh, considering that more was given to him than
he deserved, might not envy his brother. Moreover, this blessing pronounced on
Ephraim and Manasseh is not to be taken in the same sense as the former, in
which it is said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In thy seed
shall all nations be blessed</i></font><font face="Palatino">: but the simple
meaning is, that the grace of God should be so conspicuous towards the two sons
of Joseph, as to furnish the people of Israel with a form by which to express
their good wishes.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Israel said unto
Joseph</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Jacob repeats what he had said. And
truly all his sons, and especially Joseph and his sons, required something more
than one simple confirmation, in order that they might not fix their abode in
Egypt, but might dwell, in their minds, in the land of Canaan. He mentions his
own death, for the purpose of teaching them that the eternal truth of God by no
means depended on the life of men: as if he had said, my life, seeing it is
short and fading, passes away; but the promise of God, which has no limit, will
flourish when I also am dead. No vision had appeared unto his sons, but God had
ordained the holy old man as the intermediate sponsor of his covenant. He
therefore sedulously fulfills the office enjoined upon him, taking timely
precaution that their faith should not be shaken by his death. So when the Lord
delivers his word to the world by mortal men, although they die, having finished
their course of life according to the flesh; yet the voice of God is not
extinguished with them, but quickens us even at the present day. Therefore Peter
writes, that he will endeavor, that after his decease, the Church may be mindful
of the doctrine committed unto him.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;610115&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Peter 1:15.)</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Unto the land of
your fathers</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is not without reason that he
claims for himself and his fathers, the dominion over that land in which they
had always wandered as strangers; for whereas it might seem that the promise of
God had failed, he excites his sons to a good hope, and pronounces, with a
courageous spirit, that land to be his own, in which, at length, he scarcely
obtained a sepulcher, and that only by favor. Whence then was this great
confidence, except that he would accustom his sons, by his example, to have
faith in the word of God? Now this doctrine is also common to us; because we
never rely with sufficient firmness on the word of God, so long as we are led by
our own feelings. Nay, until our faith rises to lay hold on those things which
are removed afar off, we know not what it is to set our seal to the word of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have given to thee one
portion</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In order to increase the confidence of
his son Joseph, Jacob here assigns him a portion beyondhis proper lot. Some
expound the passage otherwise; as if he called him a double heir in his two
sons, thus honoring him with one portion more than the rest. But there is no
doubt that he means a certain territory. And John,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;430405&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
4:5,) removes all controversy; for, speaking of the field adjoining Sychar,
which before was called Shechem, says, it was that which Jacob gave to his son
Joseph. And, in the last chapter of Joshua,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;062432&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joshua
24:32,) it is said to have come into the possession of the sons of Joseph. But
in the word </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;k&ccedil;
</font><font face="Palatino">(<i>shechem</i>,) which among the Hebrews signifies
a <i>part</i>, allusion is made to the proper name of the place. But here a
question arises; how can he say that he had obtained the field by his sword and
by his bow, which he had purchased with money, as is stated before,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;013319&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
33:19,) and is again recorded in the above mentioned chapter of Joshua? Seeing,
however, that only a small portion of the field, where he might pitch his tents,
was bought, I do not doubt that here he comprised a much greater space. For we
may easily calculate, from the price, how small a portion of land he possessed,
before the destruction of the city. He gives, therefore, now to his son Joseph,
not only the place of his tent, which had cost a hundred pieces of silver, but
the field which had been the common of the city of Sychar. But it remains to
inquire how he may be said to have obtained it by his sword, whereas the
inhabitants had been wickedly and cruelly slain by Simon and Levi. How then
could it be acquired by the right of conquest, from those against whom war had
been unjustly brought; or rather, against whom, without any war, the most cruel
perfidy had been practiced? Jerome resorts to allegory, saying that the field
was obtained by money, which is called strength, or justice. Others suppose a
prolepsis, as if Jacob was speaking of a future acquisition of the land: a
meaning which, though I do not reject, seems yet somewhat forced. I rather
incline to this interpretation: first, that he wished to testify that he had
taken nothing by means of his two sons Simon and Levi; who, having raged like
robbers, were not lawful conquerors, and had never obtained a single foot of
land, after the perpetration of the slaughter. For, so far were they from
gaining anything, that they compelled their father to fly; nor would escape have
been possible, unless they had been delivered by miracle. When, however, Jacob
strips them of their empty title, he transfers this right of victory to himself,
as being divinely granted to him. For though he always held their wickedness in
abhorrence, and will show his detestation of it in the next chapter
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
49:1; yet, because they had armed his whole household, they fought as under his
auspices. Gladly would he have preserved the citizens of Shechem, a design which
he was not able to accomplish; yet he appropriates to himself the land left
empty and deserted by their destruction, because, for his sake, God had spared
the murderers.

Ephraim and Manasseh was related
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014801&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
48:1, because, before Jacob should treat of the state of the whole nation about
to spring from him, it was right that these two grandsons should be inserted
into the body of his sons. Now, as if carried above the heavens, he announces,
not in the character of a man, but as from the mouth of God, what shall be the
condition of them all, for a long time to come. And it will be proper first to
remark, that as he had then thirteen sons, he sets before his view, in each of
their persons, the same number of nations or tribes: in which act the admirable
lustre of his faith is conspicuous. For since he had often heard from the Lord,
that his seed should be increased to a multitude of people, this oracle is to
him like a sublime mirror, in which he may perceive things deeply hidden from
human sense. Moreover, this is not a simple confession of faith, by which Jacob
testifies that he hopes for whatever had been promised him by the Lord; but he
rises superior to men, at the interpreter and ambassador of God, to regulate the
future state of the Church. Now, since some interpreters perceived this prophecy
to be noble and magnificent, they have thought that it would not be adorned with
its proper dignity, unless they should extract from it certain new mysteries.
Thus it has happened, that in striving earnestly to elicit profound allegories,
they have departed from the genuine sense of the words, and have corrupted, by
their own inventions, what is here delivered for the solid edification of the
pious. But lest we should depreciate the literal sense, as if it did not contain
speculations sufficiently profound, let us mark the design of the holy Spirit.
In the first place, the sons of Jacob are informed beforehand, of their future
fortune, that they may know themselves to be objects of the special care of God;
and that, although the whole world is governed by his providence, they,
notwithstanding, are preferred to other nations, as members of his own
household. It seems apparently a mean and contemptible thing, that a region
productive of vines, which should yield abundance of choice wine, and one rich
in pasturers, which should supply milk, is promised to the tribe of Judah. But
if any one will consider that the Lord is hereby giving an illustrious proof of
his own election, in descending, like the father of a family, to the care of
food, and also showing, in minute things, that he is united by the sacred bond
of a covenant to the children of Abraham, he will look for no deeper mystery. In
the second place; the hope of the promised inheritance is again renewed unto
them. And, therefore, Jacob, as if he would put them in possession of the land
by his own hand, expounds familiarly, and as in an affair actually present, what
kind of habitation should belong to each of them. Can the confirmation of a
matter so serious, appear contemptible to sane and prudent readers? It is,
however, the principal design of Jacob more correctly to point out from whence a
king should arise among them, who should bring them complete felicity. And in
this manner he explains what had been promised obscurely, concerning the blessed
seed. In these things there is so great weight, that the simple treating of
them, if only we were skillful interpreters, ought justly to transport us with
admiration. But (omitting all things else) an advantage of no common kind
consists in this single point, that the mouth of impure and profane men, who
freely detract from the credibility of Moses, is shut, so that they no longer
dare to contend that he did not speak by a celestial impulse. Let us imagine
that Moses does not relate what Jacob had before prophesied, but speaks in his
own person; whence, then, could he divine what did not happen till many ages
afterwards? Such, for instance, is the prophecy concerning the kingdom of David.
And there is no doubt that God commanded the land to be divided by lot, lest any
suspicion should arise that Joshua had divided it among the tribes, by compact,
and as he had been instructed by his master. After the Israelites had obtained
possession of the land, the division of it was not made by the will of men.
Whence was it that a dwelling near the sea-shore was given to the tribe of
Zebulun; a fruitful plain to the tribe of Asher; and to the others, by lot, what
is here recorded; except that the Lord would ratify his oracles by the result,
and would show openly, that nothing then occurred which he had not, a long time
before, declared should take place? I now return to the words of Moses, in which
holy Jacob is introduced, relating what he had been taught by the Holy Spirit
concerning events still very remote. But some, with canine rage, demand, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F647</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Whence did Moses derive his knowledge of a conversation, held in an obscure hut,
two hundred years before his time? I ask in return, before I give an answer,
Whence had he his knowledge of the places in the land of Canaan, which he
assigns, like a skillful surveyor, to each tribe? If this was a knowledge
derived from heaven, (which must be granted,) why will these impious babblers
deny that the things which Jacob has predicted, were divinely revealed to Moses?
Besides, among many other things which the holy fathers had handed down by
tradition, this prediction might then be generally known. Whence was it that the
people, when tyrannically oppressed, implored the assistance of God as their
deliverer? Whence was it, that at the simple hearing of a promise formerly
given, they raised their minds to a good hope, unless that some remembrance of
the divine adoption still flourished among them? If there was a general
acquaintance with the covenant of the Lord among the people; what impudence will
it be to deny that the heavenly servants of God more accurately investigated
whatever was important to be known respecting the promised inheritance? For the
Lord did not utter oracles by the mouth of Jacob which, after his death, a
sudden oblivion should destroy; as if he had breathed, I know not what sounds,
into the air. But rather he delivered instructions common to many ages; that his
posterity might know from what source their redemption, as well as the
hereditary title of the land, flowed down to them. We know how tardily, and even
timidly, Moses undertook the province assigned him, when he was called to
deliver his own people: because he was aware that he should have to deal with an
intractable and perverse nation. It was, therefore, necessary, that he should
come prepared with certain credentials which might give proof of his vocation.
And, hence, he put forth these predictions, as public documents from the sacred
archives of God, that no one might suppose him to have intruded rashly into his
office.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Gather yourselves

Jacob begins with inviting their attention. For he gravely enters on his
subject, and claims for himself the authority of a prophet, in order to teach
his sons that he is by no means making a private testamentary disposition of his
domestic affairs; but that he is expressing in words, those oracles which are
deposited with him, until the event shall follow in due time. For he does not
command them simply to listen to his wishes, but gathers them into an assembly
by a solemn rite, that they may hear what shall occur to them in the succession
of time. Moreover, I do not doubt, that he places this future period of which he
speaks, in opposition to their exile in Egypt, that, when their minds were in
suspense, they might look forward to that promised state. Now, from the above
remarks, it may be easily inferred, that, in this prophecy is comprised the
whole period from the departure out of Egypt to the reign of Christ: not that
Jacob enumerates every event, but that, in the summary of things on which he
briefly touches, he arranges a settled order and course, until Christ should
appear.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Reuben, thou art my
first-born</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He begins with the first-born, not
for the sake of honor, to confirm him in his rank; but that he may the more
completely cover him with shame, and humble him by just reproaches. For Reuben
is here cast down from his primogeniture; because he had polluted his father's
bed by incestuous intercourse with his mother-in-law. The meaning of his words
is this: Thou, indeed, by nature the first-born, oughtest to have excelled,
seeing thou art my strength, and the beginning of my manly vigor; but since thou
best flowed away like water, there is no more any ground for arrogating anything
to thyself. For, from the day of thy incest, that dignity which thou receivedst
on thy birth-day, from thy mother's womb, is gone and vanished away. The noun
(</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wa</font><font face="Palatino">,)
some translate <i>seed</i>, others <i>grief</i>; and turn the passage thus:
"Thou my strength, and the beginning of my grief or seed." They who prefer the
word <i>grief</i>, assign as a reason, that children bring care and anxiety to
their parents. But if this were the true meaning, there would rather have been
an antithesis between strength and sorrow. Since, however, Jacob is reciting, in
continuity, the declaration of the dignity which belongs to the first-born, I
doubt not that he here mentions the beginning of his manhood. For as men, in a
certain sense, live again in their children, the first-born is properly called
the "beginning of strength." To the same point belongs what immediately follows,
that he had been the excellency of dignity and of strength, until he had
deservedly deprived himself of both. For Jacob places before the eyes of his son
Reuben his former honor, because it was for his profit to be made thoroughly
conscious whence he had fallen. So Paul says, that he set before the Corinthians
the sins by which they were defiled, in order to make them ashamed.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;460605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 6:5.) For whereas we are disposed to flatter ourselves in our vices,
scarcely any one of us is brought back to a sane mind, after he has fallen,
unless he is touched with a sense of his vileness. Moreover, nothing is better
adapted to wound us, than when a comparison is made between those favors which
God bestows upon us, and the punishments we bring upon ourselves by our own
fault. After Adam had been stripped of all good things, God reproaches him
sharply, and not without ridicule, "Behold Adam is as one of us." What end is
this designed to answer, except that Adam, reflecting with himself how far he is
changed from that man, who had lately been created according to the image of
God, and had been endowed with so many excellent gifts, might be confounded and
fall prostrate, deploring his present misery? We see, then, that reproofs are
necessary for us, in order that we may be touched to the quick by the anger of
the Lord. For so it happens, not only that we become displeased with the sins of
which we are now bearing the punishment, but also, that we take greater care
diligently to guard those gifts of God which dwell within us, lest they perish
through our negligence. They who refer the "excellency of dignity" to the
priesthood, and the "excellency of power" to the kingly office, are, in my
judgment, too subtle interpreters. I take the more simple meaning of the passage
to be; that if Reuben had stood firmly in his own rank, the chief place of all
excellency would have belonged to him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Unstable as
water</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He shows that the honor which had not a
good conscience for its keeper, was not firm but evanescent; and thus he rejects
Reuben from the primogeniture. He declares the cause, lest Reuben should
complain that he was punished when innocent: for it was also of great
consequence, in this affair, that he should be convinced of his fault, lest his
punishment should not be attended with profit. We now see Jacob, having laid
carnal affection aside, executing the office of a prophet with vigor and
magnanimity. For this judgment is not to be ascribed to anger, as if the father
desired to take private vengeance of his son: but it proceeded from the Spirit
of God; because Jacob kept fully in mind the burden imposed upon him. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">jl[</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>alach</i>) the close of the sentence signifies to depart, or to be blown
away like the ascending smoke, which is dispersed. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F649</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Therefore the sense is, that the excellency of Reuben, from the time that he had
defiled his father's bed, had flowed away and become extinct. For to expound the
expression concerning the bed, to mean that it ceased to be Jacob's conjugal
bed, because Bilhah had been divorced, is too
frigid.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Simeon and Levi are
brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He condemns the massacre of the city
of Shechem by his two sons Simon and Levi, and denounces the punishment of so
great a crime. Whence we learn how hateful cruelty is to God, seeing that the
blood of man is precious in his sight. For it is as if he would cite to his own
tribunal those two men, and would demand vengeance on them, when they thought
they had already escaped. It may, however, be asked, whether pardon had not been
granted to them long ago; and if God had already forgiven them, why does he
recall them again to punishment? I answer, it was both privately useful to
themselves, and was also necessary as an example, that this slaughter should not
remain unpunished, although they might have obtained previous forgiveness. For
we have seen before, when they were admonished by their father, how far they
were from that sorrow which is the commencement of true repentance; and it may
be believed that afterwards they became stupefied more and more, with a kind of
brutish torpor, in their wickedness; or at least, that they had not been
seriously affected with bitter grief for their sin. It was also to be feared
lest their posterity might become addicted to the same brutality, unless
divinely impressed with horror at the deed. Therefore the Lord, partly for the
purpose of humbling them, partly for that of making them an example to all ages,
inflicted on them the punishment of perpetual ignominy. Moreover, by thus
acting, he did not retain the punishment while remitting the guilt, as the
Papists foolishly dream: but though truly and perfectly appeased, he
administered a correction suitable for future times. The Papists imagine that
sins are only half remitted by God; because he is not willing to absolve sinners
gratuitously. But Scripture speaks far otherwise. It teaches us that God does
not exact punishments which shall compensate for offenses; but such as shall
purge hearts from hypocrisy, and shall invite the elect &#8212; the allurements
of the world being gradually shaken off &#8212; to repentance, shall stir them
up to vigilant solicitude, and shall keep them under restraint by the bridle of
fear and reverence. Whence it follows that nothing is more preposterous, than
that the punishments which we have deserved, should be redeemed by
satisfactions, as if God, after the manner of men, would have what was owing
paid to him; nay, rather there is the best possible agreement between the
gratuitous remission of punishments and those chastening of the rod, which
rather prevent future evils, than follow such as have been already
committed.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To return to Simeon
and Levi</i></font><font face="Palatino">. How is it that God, by inflicting a
punishment which had been long deferred, should drag them back as guilty
fugitives to judgment; unless because impunity would have been hurtful to them?
And yet he fulfills the office of a physician rather than of a judge, who
refuses to <i>spare</i>, because he intends to <i>heal</i>; and who not only
heals two who are sick, but, by an antidote, anticipates the diseases of others,
in order that they may beware of cruelty. This also is highly worthy to be
remembered, that Moses, in publishing the infamy of his own people, acts as the
herald of God: and not only does he proclaim a disgrace common to the whole
nation, but brands with infamy, the special tribe from which he sprung. Whence
it plainly appears, that he paid no respect to his own flesh and blood; nor was
he to be induced, by favor or hatred, to give a false color to anything, or to
decline from historical fidelity: but, as a chosen minister and witness of the
Lord, he was mindful of his calling, which was that he should declare the truth
of God sincerely and confidently. A comparison is here made not only between the
sons of Jacob personally; but also between the tribes which descended from them.
This certainly was a specially opportune occasion for Moses to defend the
nobility of his own people. But so far is he from heaping encomiums upon them,
that he frankly stamps the progenitor of his own tribe with an everlasting
dishonor, which should redound to his whole family. Those Lucianist dogs, who
carp at the doctrine of Moses, pretend that he was a vain man who wished to
acquire for himself the command over the rude common people. But had this been
his project, why did he not also make provision for his own family? Those sons
whom ambition would have persuaded him to endeavor to place in the highest rank,
he puts aside from the honor of the priesthood, and consigns them to a lowly and
common service. Who does not see that these impious calumnies have been
anticipated by a divine counsel rather than by merely human prudence, and that
the heirs of this great and extraordinary man were deprived of honor, for this
reason, that no sinister suspicion might adhere to him? But to say nothing of
his children and grandchildren, we may perceive that, by censuring his whole
tribe in the person of Levi, he acted not as a man, but as an angel speaking
under the impulse of the Holy Spirit, and free from all carnal affection.
Moreover, in the former clause, he announces the crime: afterwards, he subjoins
the punishment. The crime is, that the arms of violence are in their
tabernacles; and therefore he declares, both by his tongue and in his heart,
that he holds their counsel in abhorrence, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F650</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because, in their desire of revenge, they cut off a city with its inhabitants.
Respecting the meaning of the words commentators differ. For some take the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">twrkm</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>makroth</i>) to mean <i>swords</i>; as if Jacob had said, that their swords
had been wickedly polluted with innocent blood. But they think more correctly,
who translate the word <i>habitations</i>; as if he had said, that unjust
violence dwelt among them, because they had been so sanguinary. I do not doubt
that the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dbk</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>chabod</i>) is put for the tongue, as in other places; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F651</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and thus the sense is clear, that Jacob, from his heart, so detests the crime
perpetrated by his sons, that his tongue shall not give any assent to it
whatever. Which he does, for this end, that they may begin to be dissatisfied
with themselves, and that all others may learn to abhor perfidy combined with
cruelty. <i>Fury</i>, beyond doubt, signifies a perverse and blind impulse of
anger: 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F652</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and <i>lust</i> is opposed to rational moderation; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F653</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because they are governed by no law. Interpreters also differ respecting the
meaning of the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rw&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>shor</i>.) 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F654</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Some translate it "bullock," and think that the Shechemites are allegorically
denoted by it, seeing they were sufficiently robust and powerful to defend their
lives, had not Simon and Levi enervated them by fraud and perfidy. But a
different exposition is far preferable, namely, that they "overturned a wall."
For Jacob magnifies the atrociousness of their crime, from the fact, that they
did not even spare <i>buildings</i> in their
rage.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cursed be their
anger</i></font><font face="Palatino">. What I have said must be kept in mind;
namely, that we are divinely admonished by the mouth of the holy prophet, to
keep at a distance from all wicked counsels. Jacob pronounces a woe upon their
fury. Why is this, unless that others may learn to put a restraint upon
themselves, and to be on their guard against such cruelty? However, (as I have
already observed,) it will not suffice to preserve our hands pure, unless we are
far removed from all association with crime. For though it may not always be in
our power to repress unjust violence; yet that concealment of it is culpable,
which approaches to the appearance of consent. Here even the ties of kindred,
and whatever else would bias a sound judgment, must be dismissed from the mind:
since we see a holy father, at the command of God, so severely thundering
against his own sons. He pronounces the anger of Simon and Levi to be so much
the more hateful, because, in its commencement, it was violent, and even to the
end, it was implacable.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
divide them in Jacob</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It may seem a strange
method of proceeding, that Jacob, while designating his sons patriarchs of the
Church, and calling them heirs of the divine covenant, should pronounce a
malediction upon them instead of a blessing. Nevertheless it was necessary for
him to begin with the chastisement, which should prepare the way for the
manifestation of God's grace, as will be made to appear at the close of the
chapter: but God mitigates the punishment, by giving them an honorable name in
the Church, and leaving them their right unimpaired: yea, his incredible
goodness unexpectedly shone forth, when that which was the punishment of Levi,
became changed into the reward of the priesthood. The dispersion of the
Levitical tribe had its origin in the crime of their father, lest he should
congratulate himself on account of his perverse and lawless spirit of revenge.
But God, who in the beginning had produced light out of darkness, found another
reason why the Levites should be dispersed abroad among the people, &#8212; a
reason not only free from disgrace, but highly honorable, &#8212; namely, that
no corner of the land might be destitute of competent instructors. Lastly, he
constituted them overseers and governors, in his name, over every part of the
land, as if he would scatter everywhere the seed of eternal salvation, or would
send forth ministers of his grace. Whence we conclude, how much better it was
for Levi to be chastised at the time, for his own good, than to be left to
perish, in consequence of present impunity in sin. And it is not to be deemed
strange, that, when the land was distributed, and cities were given to the
Levites, far apart from each other, this reason was suppressed, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F655</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and one entirely different was adduced; namely, that the Lord was their
inheritance. For this, as I have lately said, is one of the miracles of God, to
brine light out of darkness. Had Levi been sentenced to distant exile, he would
have been most worthy of the punishment: but now, God in a measure spares him,
by assigning him a wandering life in his paternal inheritance. Afterwards, the
mark of infamy being removed, God sends his posterity into different parts,
under the title of a distinguished embassy. In Simon there remained a certain,
though obscure trace of the curse: because a distinct territory did not fall to
his sons by lot; but they were mixed with the tribe of Judah, as is stated in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;061901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joshua
19:1. Afterwards they went to Mount Seir, having expelled the Amalekites and
taken possession of their land, as it is written,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;130440&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Chronicles 4:40-43.) Here, also, we perceive the manly fortitude of holy Jacob's
breast, who, though a decrepit old man and an exile, lying on his private and
lowly couch, nevertheless assigns provinces to his sons, as from the lofty
throne of a great king. He also does this in his own right, knowing that the
covenant of God was deposited with him, by which he had been called the heir and
lord of the land: and at the same time he claims for himself authority as
sustaining the character of a prophet of God. For it greatly concerns us, when
the word of God sounds in our ears, to apprehend by faith the thing proclaimed,
as if his ministers had been commanded to carry into effect what they pronounce.
Therefore it was said to
Jeremiah,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"See I have this day set
thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and
to destroy, and to throw down, and to build, and to plant."

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Judah, thou art he whom thy
brethren shall praise</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In the word praise there
is an allusion to the name of Judah; for so he had been called by his mother,
because his birth had given occasion for praising God. The father adduces a new
etymology, because his name shall be so celebrated and illustrious among his
brethren, that he should be honored by them all equally with the first-born. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F656</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The <i>double portion</i>, indeed, which he recently assigned to his son Joseph,
depended on the right of primogeniture: but because the <i>kingdom</i> was
transferred to the tribe of Judah, Jacob properly pronounces that his name
should be held worthy of praise. For the honor of Joseph was temporary; but here
a stable and durable kingdom is treated of, which should be under the authority
of the sons of Judah. Hence we gather, that when God would institute a perfect
state of government among his people, the monarchical form was chosen by him.
And whereas the appointment of a king under the law, was partly to be attributed
to the will of man, and partly to the divine decree; this combination of human
with divine agency must be referred to the commencement of the monarchy, which
was inauspicious, because the people had tumultuously desired a king to be given
them, before the proper time had arrived. Hence their unseemly haste was the
cause why the kingdom was not immediately set up in the tribe of Judah, but was
brought forth, as an abortive offspring, in the person of Saul. Yet at length,
by the favor and in the legitimate order of God, the preeminence of the tribe of
Judah was established in the person of
David.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy hand shall be in
the neck of thine enemies</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In these words he
shows that Judah should not be free from enemies; but although many would give
him trouble, and would endeavor to deprive him of his right, Jacob promises him
victory; not that the sons of David should always prevail against their enemies,
(for their ingratitude interfered with the constant and equable course of the
grace of God,) but in this respect, at least, Judah had the superiority, that in
his tribe stood the royal throne which God approved, and which was founded on
his word. For though the kingdom of Israel was more flourishing in wealth and in
number of inhabitants, yet because it was spurious, it was not the object of
God's favor: nor indeed was it right, that, by its tinselled splendor, it should
eclipse the glory of the Divine election which was engraven upon the tribe of
Judah. In David, therefore, the force and effect of this prophecy plainly
appeared; then again in Solomon; afterwards, although the kingdom was mutilated,
yet was it wonderfully preserved by the hand of God; otherwise, in a short
space, it would have perished a hundred times. Thus it came to pass, that the
children of Judah imposed their yoke upon their enemies. Whereas defection
carried away ten tribes, which would not bow their knees to the sons of David;
the legitimate government was in this way disturbed, and lawless confusion
introduced; yet nothing could violate the decree of God, by which the right to
govern remained with the tribe of
Judah.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Judah is a lion's
whelp</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This similitude confirms the preceding
sentence, that Judah would be formidable to his enemies. Yet Jacob seems to
allude to that diminution which took place, when the greater part of the people
revolted to Jeroboam. For then the king of Judah began to be like a sleeping
lion, for he did not shake his mane to diffuse his terror far and wide, but, as
it were, laid him down in his den. Yet a certain secret power of God lay hidden
under that torpor, and they who most desired his destruction, and who were most
able to do him injury, did not dare to disturb him. Therefore, after Jacob has
transferred the supreme authority over his brethren to Judah alone; he now adds,
by way of correction, that, though his power should happen to be diminished, he
would nevertheless remain terrible to his enemies, like a lion who lies down in
his lair. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F657</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The scepter shall not
depart</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Though this passage is obscure, it
would not have been very difficult to elicit its genuine sense, if the Jews,
with their accustomed malignity, had not endeavored to envelop it in clouds. It
is certain that the Messiah, who was to spring from the tribe of Judah, is here
promised. But whereas they ought willingly to run to embrace him, they purposely
catch at every possible subterfuge, by which they may lead themselves and others
far astray in tortuous by-paths. It is no wonder, then, if the spirit of
bitterness and obstinacy, and the lust of contention have so blinded them, that,
in the clearest light, they should have perpetually stumbled. Christians, also,
with a pious diligence to set forth the glory of Christ, have, nevertheless,
betrayed some excess of fervor. For while they lay too much stress on certain
words, they produce no other effect than that of giving an occasion of ridicule
to the Jews, whom it is necessary to surround with firm and powerful barriers,
from which they shall be unable to escape. Admonished, therefore, by such
examples, let us seek, without contention, the true meaning of the passage. In
the first place, we must keep in mind the true design of the Holy Spirit, which,
hitherto, has not been sufficiently considered or expounded with sufficient
distinctness. After he has invested the tribe of Judah with supreme authority,
he immediately declares that God would show his care for the people, by
preserving the state of the kingdom, till the promised felicity should attain
its highest point. For the dignity of Judah is so maintained as to show that its
proposed end was the common salvation of the whole people. The blessing promised
to the seed of Abraham (as we have before seen) could not be firm, unless it
flowed from one head. Jacob now testifies the same thing, namely, that a King
should come, under whom that promised happiness should be complete in all its
parts. Even the Jews will not deny, that while a lower blessing rested on the
tribe of Judah, the hope of a better and more excellent condition was herein
held forth. They also freely grant another point, that the Messiah is the sole
Author of full and solid happiness and glory. We now add a third point, which we
may also do, without any opposition from them; namely, that the kingdom which
began from David, was a kind of prelude, and shadowy representation of that
greater grace which was delayed, and held in suspense, until the advent of the
Messiah. They have indeed no relish for a spiritual kingdom; and therefore they
rather imagine for themselves wealth and power, and propose to themselves sweet
repose and earthly pleasures, than righteousness, and newness of life, with free
forgiveness of sins. They acknowledge, nevertheless, that the felicity which was
to be expected under the Messiah, was adumbrated by their ancient kingdom. I now
return to the words of
Jacob.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Until Shiloh
come</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says, the scepter, or the dominion,<i>
shall remain in Judah</i>. We must first see what the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hwly&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>shiloh</i>) signifies. Because Jerome interprets it, "He who is to be sent,"
some think that the place has been fraudulently corrupted, by the letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>he</i>) substituted for the letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">j</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>cheth</i>;) which objection, though not firm, is plausible. That which some
of the Jews suppose, namely, that it denotes the place (Shiloh) where the ark of
the covenant had been long deposited, because, a little before the commencement
of David's reign, it had been laid waste, is entirely destitute of reason. For
Jacob does not here predict the time when David was to be appointed king; but
declares that the kingdom should be established in his family, until God should
fulfill what he had promised concerning the special benediction of the seed of
Abraham. Besides the form of speech, "until Shiloh come," for "until Shiloh come
to an end," would be harsh and constrained. Far more correctly and consistently
do other interpreters take this expression to mean "his son", for among the
Hebrews a son is called
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ly&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>shil</i>.) They say also that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>he</i>) is put in the place of the relative
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>waw</i>;) and the greater part assent to this signification. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F658</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But again, the Jews dissent entirely from the meaning of the patriarch, by
referring this to David. For (as I have just hinted) the origin of the kingdom
in David is not here promised, but its absolute perfection in the Messiah. And
truly an absurdity so gross, does not require a lengthened refutation. For what
can this mean, that the kingdom should not come to an end in the tribe of Judah,
till it should have been erected? Certainly the word <i>depart</i> means nothing
else than to <i>cease</i>. Further, Jacob points to a continued series, when he
says the scribe 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F659</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
shall not depart from between his feet. For it behaves a king so to be placed
upon his throne that a lawgiver may sit between his feet. A kingdom is therefore
described to us, which after it has been constituted, will not cease to exist
till a more perfect state shall succeed; or, which comes to the same point;
Jacob honors the future kingdom of David with this title, because it was to be
the token and pledge of that happy glory which had been before ordained for the
race of Abraham. In short, the kingdom which he transfers to the tribe of Judah,
he declares shall be no common kingdom, because from it, at length, shall
proceed the fullness of the promised benediction. But here the Jews haughtily
object, that the event convicts us of error. For it appears that the kingdom by
no means endured until the coming of Christ; but rather that the scepter was
broken, from the time that the people were carried into captivity. But if they
give credit to the prophecies, I wish, before I solve their objection, that they
would tell me in what manner Jacob here assigns the kingdom to his son Judah.
For we know, that when it had scarcely become his fixed possession, it was
suddenly rent asunder, and nearly its whole power was possessed by the tribe of
Ephraim. Has God, according to these men, here promised, by the mouth of Jacob,
some evanescent kingdom? If they reply, the scepter was not then broken, though
Rehoboam was deprived of a great part of his people; they can by no means escape
by this cavil; because the authority of Judah is expressly extended over all the
tribes, by these words, "Thy mother's sons shall bow their knee before thee."
They bring, therefore, nothing against us, which we cannot immediately, in turn,
retort upon <i>themselves</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino">Yet I confess the
question is not yet solved; but I wished to premise this, in order that the
Jews, laying aside their disposition to calumniate, may learn calmly to examine
the matter itself, with us. Christians are commonly wont to connect perpetual
government with the tribe of Judah, in the following manner. When the people
returned from banishment, they say, that, in the place of the royal scepter, was
the government which lasted to the time of the Maccabees. That afterwards, a
third mode of government succeeded, because the chief power of judging rested
with the Seventy, who, it appears by history, were chosen out of the regal race.
Now, so far was this authority of the royal race from having fallen into decay,
that Herod, having been cited before it, with difficulty escaped capital
punishment, because he contumaciously withdrew from it. Our commentators,
therefore, conclude that, although the royal majesty did not shine brightly from
David until Christ, yet some preeminence remained in the tribe of Judah, and
thus the oracle was fulfilled. Although these things are true, still more skill
must be used in rightly discussing this passage. And, in the first place, it
must be kept in mind, that the tribe of Judah was already constituted chief
among the rest, as preeminent in dignity, though it had not yet obtained the
dominion. And, truly, Moses elsewhere testifies, that supremacy was voluntarily
conceded to it by the remaining tribes, from the time that the people were
redeemed out of Egypt. In the second place, we must remember, that a more
illustrious example of this dignity was set forth in that kingdom which God had
commenced in David. And although defection followed soon after, so that but a
small portion of authority remained in the tribe of Judah; yet the right
divinely conferred upon it, could by no means be taken away. Therefore, at the
time when the kingdom of Israel was replenished with abundant opulence, and was
swelling with lofty pride, it was said, that the lamp of the Lord was lighted in
Jerusalem. Let us proceed further: when Ezekiel predicts the destruction of the
kingdom,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;262126&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
21:26,) he clearly shows how the scepter was to be preserved by the Lord, until
it should come into the hands of Christ: "Remove the diadem, and take off the
crown; this shall not be the same: I will overturn, overturn, overturn it, until
he come whose right it is." It may seem at first sight that the prophecy of
Jacob had failed when the tribe of Judah was stripped of its royal ornament. But
we conclude hence, that God was not bound always to exhibit the visible glory of
the kingdom on high. Otherwise, those other promises which predict the
restoration of the throne, which was cast down and broken, were false. Behold
the days come in which I will</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"raise up the tabernacle
of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof, and I will raise up
his ruins."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;300911&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Amos
9:11.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It would be absurd, however, to cite more passages,
seeing this doctrine occurs frequently in the prophets. Whence we infer, that
the kingdom was not so confirmed as always to shine with equal brightness; but
that, though, for a time, it might lie fallen and defaced, it should afterwards
recover its lost splendor. The prophets, indeed, seem to make the return from
the Babylonian exile the termination of that ruin; but since they predict the
restoration of the kingdom no otherwise than they do that of the temple and the
priesthood, it is necessary that the whole period, from that liberation to the
advent of Christ, should be comprehended. The crown, therefore, was cast down,
not for one day only, or from one single head, but for a long time, and in
various methods, until God placed it on Christ, his own lawful king. And truly
Isaiah describes the origin of Christ, as being very remote from all regal
splendor:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">"There shall come forth a
rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots."
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;231101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
11:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Why does he mention Jesse rather than David, except
because Messiah was about to proceed from the rustic hut of a private man,
rather than from a splendid palace? Why from a tree cut down, having nothing
left but the root and the trunk, except because the majesty of the kingdom was
to be almost trodden under foot till the manifestation of Christ? If any one
object, that the words of Jacob seem to have a different signification; I
answer, that whatever God has promised at any time concerning the external
condition of the Church, was so to be restricted, that, in the mean time, he
might execute his judgments in punishing men, and might try the faith of his own
people. It was, indeed, no light trial, that the tribe of Judah, in its third
successor to the throne, should be deprived of the greater portion of the
kingdom. Even a still more severe trial followed, when the sons of the king were
put to death in the sight of their father, when he, with his eyes thrust out,
was dragged to Babylon, and the whole royal family was at length given over to
slavery and captivity. But this was the most grievous trial of all; that when
the people returned to their own land, they could in no way perceive the
accomplishment of their hope, but were compelled to lie in sorrowful dejection.
Nevertheless, even then, the saints, contemplating, with the eyes of faith, the
scepter hidden under the earth, did not fail, or become broken in spirit, so as
to desist from their course. I shall, perhaps, seem to grant too much to the
Jews, because I do not assign what they call a real dominion, in uninterrupted
succession, to the tribe of Judah. For our interpreters, to prove that the Jews
are still kept bound by a foolish expectation of the Messiah, insist on this
point, that the dominion of which Jacob had prophesied, ceased from the time of
Herod; as if, indeed, they had not been tributaries five hundred years
previously; as if, also, the dignity of the royal race had not been extinct as
long as the tyranny of Antiochus prevailed; as if, lastly, the Asmonean race had
not usurped to itself both the rank and power of princes, until the Jews became
subject to the Romans. And that is not a sufficient solution which is proposed;
namely, that either the regal dominion, or some lower kind of government, are
disjunctively promised; and that from the time when the kingdom was destroyed,
the scribes remained in authority. For I, in order to mark the distinction
between a lawful government and tyranny, acknowledge that counselors were joined
with the king, who should administer public affairs rightly and in order.
Whereas some of the Jews explain, that the <i>right</i> of government was given
to the tribe of Judah, because it was unlawful for it to be transferred
elsewhere, but that it was not necessary that the <i>glory</i> of the crown once
given should be perpetuated, I deem it right to subscribe in part to this
opinion. I say, in part, because the Jews gain nothing by this cavil, who, in
order to support their fiction of a Messiah yet to come, postpone that
subversion of the regal dignity which, in fact, long ago occurred. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F660</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For we must keep in memory what I have said before, that while Jacob wished to
sustain the minds of his descendants until the coming of the Messiah; lest they
should faint through the weariness of long delay, he set before them an example
in their temporal kingdom: as if he had said, that there was no reason why the
Israelites, when the kingdom of David fell, should allow their hope to waver;
seeing that no other change should follow, which could answer to the blessing
promised by God, until the Redeemer should appear. That the nation was
grievously harassed, and was under servile oppression some years before the
coming of Christ happened, through the wonderful counsel of God, in order that
they might be urged by continual chastisements to wish for redemption.
Meanwhile, it was necessary that some collective body of the nation should
remain, in which the promise might receive its fulfillment. But now, when,
through nearly fifteen centuries, they have been scattered and banished from
their country, having no polity, by what pretext can they fancy, from the
prophecy of Jacob, that a Redeemer will come to them? Truly, as I would not
willingly glory over their calamity; so, unless they, being subdued by it, open
their eyes, I freely pronounce that they are worthy to perish a thousand times
without remedy. It was also a most suitable method for retaining them in the
faith, that the Lord would have the sons of Jacob turn their eyes upon one
particular tribe, that they might not seek salvation elsewhere; and that no
vague imagination might mislead them. For which end, also, the election of this
family is celebrated, when it is frequently compared with, and preferred to
Ephraim and the rest, in the Psalms. To us, also, it is not less useful, for the
confirmation of our faith, to know that Christ had been not only promised, but
that his origin had been pointed out, as with a finger, two thousand years
before he appeared. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F661</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
unto him shall the gathering of the people be</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
Here truly he declares that Christ should be a king, not over one people only,
but that under his authority various nations shall be gathered, that they might
coalesce together. I know, indeed, that the word rendered "gathering" is
differently expounded by different commentators; but they who derive it from the
root
(</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hhq</font><font face="Palatino">,)
to make it signify the <i>weakening</i> of the people, rashly and absurdly
misapply what is said of the saving dominion of Christ, to the sanguinary pride
with which they puffed up. If the word <i>obedience</i> is preferred, (as it is
by others,) the sense will remain the same with that which I have followed. For
this is the mode in which the gathering together will be effected; namely, that
they who before were carried away to different objects of pursuit, will consent
together in obedience to one common Head. Now, although Jacob had previously
called the tribes about to spring from him by the name of <i>peoples</i>, for
the sake of amplification, yet this gathering is of still wider extent. For,
whereas he had included the whole body of the nation by their families, when he
spoke of the ordinary dominion of Judah, he now extends the boundaries of a new
king: as if he would say, "There shall be kings of the tribe of Judah, who shall
be preeminent among their brethren, and to whom the sons of the same mother
shall bow down: but at length He shall follow in succession, who shall subject
other <i>peoples</i> unto himself." But this, we know, is fulfilled in Christ;
to whom was promised the inheritance of the world; under whose yoke the nations
are brought; and at whose will they, who before were scattered, are gathered
together. Moreover, a memorable testimony is here borne to the vocation of the
Gentiles, because they were to be introduced into the joint participation of the
covenant, in order that they might become one people with the natural
descendants of Abraham, under one Head.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Binding his fole unto the
vine, and his ass's colt, etc</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He now speaks of
the situation of the territory which fell by lot to the sons of Judah; and
intimates, that so great would be the abundance of vines there, that they would
everywhere present themselves as readily as brambles, or unfruitful shrubs, in
other places. For since asses are wont to be bound to the hedges, he here
reduces vines to this contemptible use. The hyperbolical forms of speech which
follow are to be applied to the same purpose; namely, that Judah shall wash his
garments in wine, and his eyes be red there-with. He means that the abundance of
wine shall be so great, that it may be poured out to wash with, like water, at
no great expense; but that, by constant copious drinking, the eyes would
contract redness. But it seems by no means proper, that a profuse intemperance
or extravagance should be accounted a blessing. I answer, although fertility and
affluence are here described, still the abuse of them is not sanctioned. If the
Lord deals very bountifully with us, yet he frequently prescribes the rule of
using his gifts with purity and frugality, lest they should stimulate the
incontinence of the flesh. But in this place Jacob, omitting to state what is
lawful, extols that abundance which would suffice for luxury, and even for
vicious and perverse excesses, unless the sons of Judah should voluntarily use
self-government. I abstain from those allegories which to some appear plausible;
because, as I said at the beginning of the chapter, I do not choose to sport
with such great mysteries of God. To these lofty speculators the partition of
the land which God prescribed, for the purpose of accrediting his servant Moses,
seems a mean and abject thing. But unless our ingratitude has attained a
senseless stupor, we ought to be wholly transported with admiration at the
thought, that Moses, who had never seen the land of Canaan, should treat of its
separate parts as correctly as he could have done, of a few acres cultivated by
his own hand. Now, supposing he had heard a general report of the existence of
vines in the land; yet he could not have assigned to Judah abundant vineyards,
nor could he have assigned to him rich pastures, by saying that his teeth should
be white with drinking milk, unless he had been guided by the
Spirit.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Zebulun shall dwell at the
havens of the sea</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Although this blessing
contains nothing rare or precious, (as neither do some of those which follow,)
yet we ought to deem this fact as sufficiently worthy of notice, that it was
just as if God was stretching out his hand from heaven, for the deliverance of
the children of Israel, and for the purpose of distributing to each his own
dwelling-place. Before mention is made of the lost itself, a maritime region is
given to the tribe of Zebulun, which it obtained by lot two hundred years
afterwards. And we know of how great importance that hereditary gift was, which,
like an earnest, rendered the adoption of the ancient people secure. Therefore,
by this prophecy, not only one tribe, but the whole people, ought to have been
encouraged to lay hold, with alacrity, of the offered blessing which was
certainly in store for them. But it is said that the portion of Zebulun should
not only be on the sea-shore, but should also have havens; for Jacob joins its
boundary with the country of Zion; in which tract, we know, there were
commodious and noble havens. For God, by this prophecy, would not only excite
the sons of Zebulun more strenuously to prepare themselves to enter upon the
land; but would also assure them, when they obtained possession of the desired
portion, that it was the home which had been distinctly proposed and ordained
for them by the will of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Issachar</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
Here mention is partly made of the inheritance, and an indication is partly
given of the future condition of this tribe. Although he is called a bony ass on
account of his strength, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F662</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which would enable him to endure labors, especially such as were rustic, yet at
the same time his sloth is indicated: for it is added a little afterwards, that
he should be of servile disposition. Wherefore the meaning is, that the sons of
Issachar, though possessed of strength, were yet quiet rather than courageous,
and were as ready to bear the burden of servitude as mules are to submit their
backs to the packsaddle and the load. The reason given is, that, being content
with their fertile and pleasant country, they do not refuse to pay tribute to
their neighbors, provided they may enjoy repose. And although this
submissiveness is not publicly mentioned either to their praise or their
condemnation, it is yet probable that their indolence is censured, because their
want of energy hindered them from remaining in possession of that liberty which
had been divinely granted unto them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Dan shall judge his
people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In the word <i>judge</i> there is an
allusion to his name: for since, among the Hebrews,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wd</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>din</i>) signifies to judge, Rachel, when she returned thanks to God, gave
this name to the son born to her by her handmaid, as if God had been the
vindicator of her cause and right. Jacob now gives a new turn to the meaning of
the name; namely, that the sons of Dan shall have no mean part in the government
of the people. For the Jews foolishly restrict it to Samson, because he alone
presided over the whole people, whereas the language rather applies to the
perpetual condition of the tribe. Jacob therefore means, that though Dan was
born from a concubine, he shall still be one of the judges of Israel: because
not only shall his offspring possess a share of the government and command, in
the common polity, so that this tribe may constitute one head; but it shall be
appointed the bearer of a standard to lead the fourth division of the camp of
Israel. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F663</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In the second place, his subtle disposition is described. For Jacob compares
this people to serpents, who rise out of their lurking-places, by stealth,
against the unwary whom they wish to injure. The sense then is, that he shall
not be so courageous as earnestly and boldly to engage in open conflict; but
that he will fight with cunning, and will make use of snares. Yet, in the
meantime, he shows that he will be superior to his enemies, whom he does not
dare to approach with collected forces, just as serpents who, by their secret
bite, cast down the horse and his rider. In this place also no judgment is
expressly passed, whether this subtlety of Dan is to be deemed worthy of praise
or of censure: but conjecture rather inclines us to place it among his faults,
or at least his disadvantages, that instead of opposing himself in open conflict
with his enemies, he will fight them only with secret frauds. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F664</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have waited for thy
salvation, O Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It may be asked, in the
first place, what occasion induced the holy man to break the connection of his
discourse, and suddenly to burst forth in this expression; for whereas he had
recently predicted the coming of the Messiah, the mention of salvation would
have been more appropriate in that place. I think, indeed, that when he
perceived, as from a lofty watchtower, the condition of his offspring
continually exposed to various changes, and even to be tossed by storms which
would almost overwhelm them, he was moved with solicitude and fear; for he had
not so put off all paternal affection, as to be entirely without care for those
who were of his own blood. He, therefore, foreseeing many troubles, many
dangers, many assaults, and even many slaughters, which threatened his seed with
as many destructions, could not but condole with them, and, as a man, be
troubled at the sight. But in order that he might rise against every kind of
temptation with victorious constancy of mind, he commits himself unto the Lord,
who had promised that he would be the guardian of his people. Unless this
circumstance be observed, I do not see why Jacob exclaims here, rather than at
the beginning or the end of his discourse, that he waited for the salvation of
the Lord. But when this sad confusion of things presented itself to him, which
was not only sufficiently violent to shake his faith, but was more than
sufficiently burdensome entirely to overwhelm his mind, his best remedy was to
oppose to it this shield. I doubt not also, that he would advise his sons to
rise with him to the exercise of the same confidence. Moreover, because he could
not be the author of his own salvation, it was necessary for him to repose upon
the promise of God. In the same manner, also, must we, at this day, hope for the
salvation of the Church: for although it seems to be tossed on a turbulent sea,
and almost sunk in the waves, and though still greater storms are to be feared
in future; yet amidst manifold destructions, salvation is to be hoped for, in
that deliverance which the Lord has promised. It is even possible that Jacob,
foreseeing by the Spirit, how great would be the ingratitude, perfidy, and
wickedness of his posterity, by which the grace of God might be smothered, was
contending against these temptations. But although he expected salvation not for
himself alone, but for all his posterity, this, however, deserves to be
specially noted, that he exhibits the life-giving covenant of God to many
generations, so as to prove his own confidence that, after his death, God would
be faithful to his promise. Whence also it follows, that, with his last breath,
and as if in the midst of death, he laid hold on eternal life. But if he, amidst
obscure shadows, relying on a redemption seen afar off, boldly went forth to
meet death; what ought we to do, on whom the clear day has shined; or what
excuse remains for us, if our minds fail amidst similar agitations? 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F665</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Gad, a
troop</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Jacob also makes allusion to the name of
Gad. He had been so called, because Jacob had obtained a numerous offspring by
his mother Leah. His fattier now admonishes him, that though his name implied a
<i>multitude</i>, he should yet have to do with a great number of enemies, by
whom, for a time, he would be oppressed: and he predicts this event, not that
his posterity might confide in their own strength, and become proud; but that
they might prepare themselves to endure the suffering by which the Lord
intended, and now decreed to humble them. Yet, as he here exhorts them to
patient endurance, so he presently raises and animates them by the superadded
consolation, that, at length, they should emerge from oppression, and should
triumph over those enemies by whom they had been vanquished and routed; but this
only at the last. Moreover, this prophecy may be applied to the whole Church,
which is assailed not for one day only, but is perpetually crushed by fresh
attacks, until at length God shall exalt it to
honor.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Out of

alluded to, which he declares shall be fruitful in the best and finest wheat, so
that it shall need no foreign supply of food, having abundance at home. By
<i>royal dainties</i>, he means such as are exquisite. Should any one object,
that it is no great thing to be fed with nutritious and pleasant bread; I
answer; we must consider the end designed; namely, that they might hereby know
that they were fed by the paternal care of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Naphtali</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
Some think that in the tribe of Naphtali fleetness is commended; I rather
approve another meaning, namely, that it will guard and defend itself by
eloquence and suavity of words, rather than by force of arms. It is, however, no
despicable virtue to soothe ferocious minds, and to appease excited anger, by
bland and gentle discourse; or if any offense has been stirred up, to allay it
by a similar artifice. He therefore assigns this praise to the sons of Naphtali,
that they shall rather study to fortify themselves by humanity, by sweet words,
and by the arts of peace, then by the defense of arms. He compares them to a
hind let loose, which having been taken in hunting, is not put to death, but is
rather cherished with delicacies.

bough</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Others translate it, "a son of honor," 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F667</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and both are suitable; but I rather incline to the former sense, because it
seems to me that it refers to the name Joseph, by which <i>addition</i> or
<i>increase</i> is signified; although I have no objection to the similitude
taken from a tree, vehicle, being planted near a fountain, draws from the
watered earth the moisture and sap by which it grows the faster. The sum of the
figure is, that he is born to grow like a tree situated near a fountain, so
that, by its beauty and lofty stature, it may surmount the obstacles around it.
For I do not interpret the words which follow to mean that there will be an
assemblage of <i>virgins</i> upon the walls, whom the sight of the tree shall
have attracted; but, by a continued metaphor, I suppose the tender and smaller
branches to be called daughters. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F668</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And they are said "to run over the wall" when they spread themselves far and
wide. Besides, Jacob's discourse does not relate simply to the whole tribe, nor
is it a mere prophecy of future times; but the personal history of Joseph is
blended with that of his descendants. Thus some things are peculiar to himself,
and others belong to the two tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh. So when Joseph is
said to have been "grieved," this is wont to be referred especially to himself.
And whereas Jacob has compared him to a tree; so he calls both his brethren and
Potiphar, with his wife, "archers." 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F669</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Afterwards, however, he changes the figure by making Joseph himself like a
strenuous archer, whose bow abides in strength, and whose arms are not relaxed,
nor have lost, in any degree, their vigor; by which expressions he predicts the
invincible fortitude of Joseph, because he has yielded to no blows however hard
and severe. At the same time we are taught that he stood, not by the power of
his own arm, but as being strengthened by the hand of God, whom he distinguishes
by the peculiar title of "the mighty God of Jacob," because he designed his
power to be chiefly conspicuous, and to shine most brightly in the Church.
Meanwhile, he declares that the help by which Joseph was assisted, arose from
hence, that God had chosen that family for himself For the holy fathers were
extremely solicitous that the gratuitous covenant of God should be remembered by
themselves and by their children, whenever any benefit was granted unto them.
And truly it is a mark of shameful negligence, not to inquire from what fountain
we drink water. In the mean time he tacitly censures the impious and ungodly
fury of his ten sons; because, by attempting the murder of their brother, they,
like the giants, had carried on war against God. He also admonishes them for the
future, that they should rather choose to be protected by the guardianship of
God, than to make him their enemy, seeing that he is alike willing to give help
to all. And hence arises a consideration consolatory to all the pious, when they
hear that the power of God resides in the midst of the Church, if they do but
glory in him alone; as the Psalm teaches,</font><br></div>

must rather bear themselves nobly and triumphantly in the
Lord.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What follows admits of various
interpretations. Some translate it, "From thence is the shepherd, the stone of
Israel;" as if Jacob would say, that Joseph had been the nourisher and rock, or
stay of his house. Others read, "the shepherd of the stone," in the genitive
case, which I approve, except that they mistake the sense, by taking "stone" to
mean family. I refer it to God, who assigned the office of shepherd to his
servant Joseph, in the manner in which any one uses the service of a hireling to
feed his flock. For whence did it arise that he nourished his own people, except
that he was the dispenser of the Divine beneficence? Moreover, under this type,
the image of Christ is depicted to us, who, before he should come forth as the
conqueror of death and the author of life, was set as a mark of contradiction,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;581203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
12:3,) against whom all cast their darts; as now also, after his example, the
Church also must be transfixed with many arrows, that she may be kept by the
wonderful help of God. Moreover, lest the brethren should maliciously envy
Joseph, Jacob sets his victory in an amiable point of view to them, by saying
that he had been liberated in order that he might become their nourisher or
shepherd.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Even by the God of thy
father</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Again, he more fully affirms that
Joseph had been delivered from death, and exalted to such great dignity, not by
his own industry, but by the favor of God: and there is not the least doubt that
he commends to all the pious, the mere goodness of God, lest they should
arrogate anything to themselves, whether they may have escaped from dangers, or
whether they may have risen to any rank of honor. <i>By the God of thy
father</i>. In designating God by this title, he again traces whatever good
Joseph has received, to the covenant, and to the fountain of gratuitous
adoption; as if he had said, "Whereas thou hast proved the paternal care of God
in helping thee, I desire that thou wouldst ascribe this to the covenant which
God has made with me." Meanwhile, (as we have said before,) he separates from
all fictitious idols the God whom he transmits to his descendants to
worship.</font><br><font face="Palatino">After he has declared, that Joseph
should be blessed in every way, both as it respects his own life, and the number
and preservation of his posterity; he affirms that the effect of this
benediction is near and almost present, by saying, that he blessed Joseph more
efficaciously than he himself had been blessed by his fathers. For although,
from the beginning, God had been true to his promises, yet he frequently
postponed the effect of them, as if he had been feeding Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob with nothing but words. For, to what extent were the patriarchs multiplied
in Egypt? Where was that immense seed which should equal the sands of the
seashore and the stars of heaven? Therefore, not without reason, Jacob declares
that the full time had arrived in which the result of his benediction, which had
lain concealed, should emerge as from the deep. Now, this comparison ought to
inspire us with much greater alacrity at the present time; for the abundant
riches of the grace of God which have flowed to us in Christ, exceeds a
hundredfold, any blessings which Joseph received and
felt.</font><br><font face="Palatino">What is added
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>respecting the utmost bounds of
the everlasting hills</i></font><font face="Palatino">, some wish to refer to
distance of place, some to perpetuity of time. Both senses suit very well;
either that the felicity of Joseph should diffuse itself far and wide to the
farthest mountains of the world; or that it should endure as long as the
everlasting hills, which are the firmest portions of the earth, shall stand. The
more certain and genuine sense, however, is to be gathered from the other
passage, where Moses repeats this benediction; namely, that the fertility of the
land would extend to the tops of the mountains; and these mountains are called
perpetual, because they are most celebrated. He also declares that this blessing
should be <i>upon his head</i>, lest Joseph might think that his good wishes
were scattered to the winds; for by this word he intends to show, if I may so
speak, that the blessing was substantial. At length he calls Joseph
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ryzn
</font><font face="Palatino">(<i>nazir</i>) among his brethren, either because
he was their <i>crown</i>, on account of the common glory which redounds from
him to them all, or because, on account of the dignity by which he excels, he
was <i>separated</i> from them all. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F670</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It may be understood in both senses. Yet we must know that this excellency was
temporal, because Joseph, together with the others, was required to take his
proper place, and to submit himself to the scepter of
Judah.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Benjamin shall ravin as a
wolf</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some of the Jews think the Benjamites are
here condemned; because, when they had suffered lusts to prevail, like lawless
robbers, among them, they were at length cut down and almost destroyed by a
terrible slaughter, for having defiled the Levite's wife. Others regard it as an
honorable encomium, by which Saul, or Mordecai was adorned, who were both of the
tribe of Benjamin. The interpreters of our own age most inaptly apply it to the
apostle Paul, who was changed from a wolf into a preacher of the Gospel. Nothing
seems to me more probable than that the disposition and habits of the whole
tribe is here delineated; namely, that they would live by plunder.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the morning they would seize
and devour the prey,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> in the evening they would
divide the spoil; by which words he describes their diligence in
plundering.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All these are the twelve
tribes of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses would teach us by these
words, that his predictions did not apply only to the sons of Jacob, but
extended to their whole race. We have, indeed, shown already, with sufficient
clearness, that the expressions relate not to their persons only; but this verse
was to be added, in order that the readers might more clearly perceive the
celestial majesty of the Spirit. Jacob beholds his twelve sons. Let us grant
that, at that time, the number of his offspring, down to his great
grandchildren, had increased a hundredfold. He does not, however, merely declare
what is to be the condition of six hundred or a thousand men, but subjects
regions and nations to his sentence; nor does he put himself rashly forward,
since it is found afterwards, by the event, that God had certainly made known to
him, what he had himself decreed to execute. Moreover, seeing that Jacob beheld,
with the eyes of faith, things which were not only very remote, but altogether
hidden from human sense; woe be unto our depravity, if we shut our eyes against
the very accomplishment of the prediction in which the truth conspicuously
appears.</font><br><font face="Palatino">But it may seem little consonant to
reason, that Jacob is said to have blessed his posterity. For, in deposing
Reuben from the primogeniture, he pronounced nothing joyous or prosperous
respecting him; he also declared his abhorrence of Simon and Levi. It cannot be
alleged that there is an antiphrasis in the word of benediction, as if it were
used in a sense contrary to what is usual; because it plainly appears to be
applied by Moses in a good, and not an evil sense. I therefore reconcile these
things with each other thus; that the temporal punishments with which Jacob
mildly and paternally corrected his sons, would not subvert the covenant of
grace on which the benediction was founded; but rather, by obliterating their
stains, would restore them to the original degree of honor from which they had
fallen, so that, at least, they should be patriarchs among the people of God.
And the Lord daily proves, in his own people, that the punishments he lays upon
them, although they occasion shame and disgrace, are so far from opposing their
happiness, that they rather promote it. Unless they were purified in this
manner, it were to be feared lest they should become more and more hardened in
their vices, and lest the hidden virus should produce corruption, which at
length would penetrate to the vitals. We see how freely the flesh indulges
itself, even when God rouses us by the tokens of his anger. What then do we
suppose would take place if he should always connive at transgression? But when
we, after having been reproved for our sins, repent, this result not only
absorbs the curse which was felt at the beginning, but also proves that the Lord
blesses us more by punishing us, than he would have done by sparing us. Hence it
follows, that diseases, poverty, famine, nakedness, and even death itself, so
far as they promote our salvation, may deservedly be reckoned blessings, as if
their very nature were changed; just as the letting of blood may be not less
conducive to health than food. When it is added at the close<i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>every one according to his
blessing</i></font><font face="Palatino">, Moses again affirms, that Jacob not
only implored a blessing on his sons, from a paternal desire for their welfare,
but that he pronounced what God had put into his mouth; because at length the
event proved that the prophecies were
efficacious.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he charged
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We have seen before, that Jacob
especially commanded his son Joseph to take care that his body should be buried
in the land of Canaan. Moses now repeats that the same command was given to all
his sons, in order that they might go to that country with one consent; and
might mutually assist each other in performing this office. We have stated
elsewhere why he made such a point of conscience of his sepulture; which we must
always remember, lest the example of the holy man should be drawn injudiciously
into a precedent for superstition. Truly he did not wish to be carried into the
land of Canaan, as if he would be the nearer heaven for being buried there: but
that, being dead, he might claim possession of a land which he had held during
his life, only by a precarious tenure. Not that any advantage would hence accrue
to him privately, seeing he had already fulfilled his course; but because it was
profitable that the memory of the promise should be renewed, by this symbol,
among his surviving sons, in order that they might aspire to it. Meanwhile, we
gather that his mind did not cleave to the earth; because, unless he had been an
heir of heaven, he would never have hoped that God, for the sake of one who was
dead, would prove so bountiful towards his children. Now, to give the greater
weight to his command, Jacob declares that this thing had not come first into
his own mind, but that he had been thus taught by his forefathers. Abraham, he
says, bought that sepulcher for himself and his family: hitherto, we have
sacredly kept the law delivered to us by him. You must therefore take care not
to violate it, in order that after my death also, some token of the favor of God
may continue with us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>33.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He gathered up his
feet</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The expression is not superfluous:
because Moses wished thereby to describe the placid death of the holy man: as if
he had said, that the aged saint gave directions respecting the disposal of his
body, as easily as healthy and vigorous men are wont to compose themselves to
sleep. And truly a wonderful vigor and presence of mind was necessary for him,
when, while death was in his countenance, he thus courageously fulfilled the
prophetic office enjoined upon him. And it is not to be doubted that such
efficacy of the Holy Spirit manifested itself in him, as served to produce, in
his sons, confidence in, and reverence for his prophecies. At the same time,
however, it is proper to observe, that it is the effect of a good conscience, to
be able to depart out of the world without terror. For since death is by nature
formidable, wonderful torments agitate the wicked, when they perceive that they
are summoned to the tribunal of God. Moreover, in order that a good conscience
may lead us peacefully and quietly to the grave, it is necessary to rely upon
the resurrection of Christ; for we then go willingly to God, when we have
confidence respecting a better life. We shall not deem it grievous to leave this
failing tabernacle, when we reflect on the everlasting abode which is prepared
for us.</font><br><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">CHAPTER

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joseph fell upon his father's
face</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In this chapter, what happened after the
death of Jacob, is briefly related. Moses, however, states that Jacob's death
was honored with a double mourning &#8212; natural (so to speak) and ceremonial.
That Joseph falls upon his father's face and sheds tears, flows from true and
pure affection; that the Egyptians mourn for him seventy days, since it is done
for the sake of honor, and in compliance with custom, is more from ostentation
and vain pomp, than from true grief: and yet the dead are generally mourned over
in this manner, that the last debt due to them may be discharged. Whence also
the proverb has originated, that the mourning of the heir is laughter under a
mask. And although sometimes minds are penetrated with real grief; yet something
is added to it, by the affectation of making a show of pious sorrow, so that
they indulge largely in tears in the presence of others, who would weep more
sparingly if there were no witnesses of their grief Hence those friends who meet
together, under the pretext of administering consolation, often pursue a course
so different, that they call forth more abundant weeping. And although the
ceremony of mourning over the dead arose from a good principle; namely, that the
living should meditate on the curse entailed by sin upon the human race, yet it
has always been tarnished by many evils; because it has been neither directed to
its true end, nor regulated by due moderation. With respect to the genuine grief
which is not unnaturally elicited, but which breaks forth from the depth of our
hearts, it is not, in itself, to be censured, if it be kept within due bounds.
For Joseph is not here reproved because he manifests his grief by weeping; but
his filial piety is rather commended. We have, however, need of the rein, and of
self-government, lest, through intemperate grief, we are hurried, by a blind
impulse, to murmur against God: for excessive grief always precipitates us into
rebellion. Moreover, the mitigation of sorrow is chiefly to be sought for, in
the hope of a future life, according to the doctrine of
Paul.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joseph commanded his
servants</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Although formerly more labor was
expended on funerals, and that even without superstition, than has been deemed
right subsequently to the proof given of the resurrection exhibited by Christ: 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F671</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
yet we know that among the Egyptians there was greater expense and pomp than
among the Jews. Even the ancient historians record this among the most memorable
customs of that nation. Indeed it is not to be doubted (as we have said
elsewhere) that the sacred rite of burial descended from the holy fathers, to be
a kind of mirror of the future resurrection: but as hypocrites are always more
diligent in the performance of ceremonies, than they are, who possess the solid
substance of things; it happens that they who have declined from the true faith,
assume a far more ostentatious appearance than the faithful, to whom pertain the
truth and the right use of the symbol. If we compare the Jews with ourselves,
these shadowy ceremonies, in which God required them to be occupied, would, at
this time, appear intolerable; though compared with those of other nations, they
were moderate and easily to be borne. But the heathen scarcely knew why they
incurred so muck labor and expense. Hence we infer how empty and trivial a
matter it is, to attend only to external signs, when the pure doctrine which
exhibits their true origin and their legitimate end, does not flourish. It is an
act of piety to bury the dead. To embalm corpses with aromatic spices, was, in
former times, no fault; inasmuch as it was done as a public symbol of future
incorruption. For it is not possible but that the sight of a dead man should
grievously affect us; as if one common end, without distinction, awaited both us
and the beasts that perish. At this day the resurrection of Christ is a
sufficient support for us against yielding to this temptation. But the ancients,
on whom the full light of day had not yet shone, were aided by figures: they,
however, whose minds were not raised to the hope of a better life, did nothing
else than trifle, and foolishly imitate the holy fathers. Finally, where faith
has not so breathed its odour, as to make men know that something remains for
them after death, all embalming will be vapid. Yea, if death is to them the
eternal destruction of the body, it would be an impious profanation of a sacred
and useful ceremony, to attempt to place what had perished under such costly
custody. It is probable that Joseph, in conforming himself to the Egyptians,
whose superfluous care was not free from absurdity; acted rather from fear than
from judgment, or from approval of their method. Perhaps he improperly imitated
the Egyptians, lest the condition of his father might be worse than that of
other men. But it would have been better, had he confined himself to the frugal
practice of his fathers. Nevertheless though he might be excusable, the same
practice is not now lawful for us. For unless we wish to subvert the glory of
Christ, we must cultivate greater
sobriety.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And forty days were fulfilled for
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We have shown already that Moses is
speaking of a ceremonial mourning; and therefore he does not prescribe it as a
law, or produce it as an example which it is right for us to follow. For, by the
laws, certain days were appointed, in order that time might be given for the
moderating of grief in some degree; yet something also was conceded to ambition.
Another rule, however, for restraining grief is given to us by the Lord. And
Joseph stooped, more than he ought, to the perverted manners of the Egyptians;
for the world affects to believe that whatever is customary is lawful; so that
what generally prevails, carries along everything it meets, like a violent
inundation. The seventy days which Moses sets apart to solemn mourning,
Herodotus, in his second book, assigns to the embalming. But Diodorus writes
that the seasoning of the body was completed in thirty days. Both authors
diligently describe the method of embalming. And though I will not deny that, in
the course of time, the skill and industry in practicing this art increased, yet
it appears to me probable that this method of proceeding was handed down from
the fathers.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Joseph spake unto the house of
Pharaoh</i></font><font face="Palatino">. A brief narration is here inserted of
the permission obtained for Joseph, that, with the goodwill and leave of the
king, he might convey his father's remains to the sepulcher of the double cave.
Now, though he himself enjoyed no common decree of favor, he yet makes use of
the courtiers as his intercessors. Why did he act thus, unless on the ground
that the affair was in itself odious to the people? For nothing (as we have said
before) was less tolerable to the Egyptians, than that their land, of the
sanctity of which they made their especial boast, should be despised. Therefore
Joseph, in order to transfer the offense from himself to another, pleads
necessity: as if he would say, that the burying of his father was not left to
his own choice, because Jacob had laid him under obligation as to the mode of
doing it, by the imposition of an oath. Wherefore, we see that he was oppressed
by servile fear, so that he did not dare frankly and boldly to profess his own
faith; since he is compelled to act a part, in order to transfer to the deceased
whatever odium might attend the transaction. Now, whereas a more simple and
upright confession of faith is required of the sons of God, let none of us seek
refuge under such pretexts: but rather let us learn to ask of the Lord the
spirit of fortitude and constancy which shall direct us to bear our testimony to
true religion. Yet if men allow us the free profession of religion, let us give
thanks for it. Now, seeing that Joseph did not dare to move his foot, except by
permission of the king, we infer hence, that he was bound by his splendid
fortune, as by golden fetters. And truly, such is the condition of all who are
advanced to honor and favor in royal courts; so that there is nothing better for
men of sane mind, than to be content with a private condition. Joseph also
mitigates the offense which he feared he was giving, by another circumstance,
when he says, that the desire to be buried in the land of Canaan was not one
which had recently entered into his father's mind, because he had dug his grave
there long before; whence it follows that he had not been induced to do so by
any disgust taken against the land of
Egypt.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Pharaoh
said</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We have seen that Joseph adopts a middle
course. For he was not willing utterly to fail in his duty; yet, by catching at
a pretext founded on the command of his father, he did not conduct himself with
sufficient firmness. It is possible that Pharaoh was inclined, by the modesty of
his manner, more easily to assent to his requests. Yet this cowardice is not, on
this account, so sanctioned that the sons of God are at liberty to indulge
themselves in it: for if they intrepidly follow where duty calls, the Lord will
give the issue which is desired, beyond all expectation. For, although, humanly
speaking, Joseph's bland submission succeeded prosperously, it is nevertheless
certain that the proud mind of the king was influenced by God to concede thus
benignantly what had been desired. It is also to be observed, what great respect
for an oath prevailed among blind unbelievers. For, though Pharaoh himself had
not sworn, he still deemed it unlawful for him to violate, by his own authority,
the pledge given by another. But at this day, reverence for God has become so
far extinct, that men commonly regard it as a mere trifle to deceive, on one
side or another, under the name of God. But such unbridled license, which even
Pharaoh himself denounces, shall not escape the judgment of God with
impunity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joseph went
up</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses gives a full account of the burial.
What he relates concerning the renewed mourning of Joseph and his brethren, as
well as of the Egyptians, ought by no means to be established as a rule among
ourselves. For we know, that since our flesh has no self government, men
commonly exceed bounds both in sorrowing and in rejoicing. The tumultuous
glamour, which the inhabitants of the place admired, cannot be excused. And
although Joseph had a right end in view, when he fixed the mourning to last
through seven successive days, yet this excess was not free from blame.
Nevertheless, it was not without reason that the Lord caused this funeral to be
thus honorably celebrated: for it was of great consequence that a kind of
sublime trophy should be raised, which might transmit to posterity the memory of
Jacob's faith. If he had been buried privately, and in a common manner, his fame
would soon have been extinguished; but now, unless men willfully blind
themselves, they have continually before their eyes a noble example, which may
cherish the hope of the promised inheritance: they perceive, as it were, the
standard of that deliverance erected, Which shall take place in the fullness of
time. Wherefore, we are not here to consider the honor of the deceased so much
as the benefit of the living. Even the Egyptians, not knowing what they do, bear
a torch before the Israelites, to teach them to keep the course of their divine
calling: the Canaanites do the same, when they distinguish the place by a new
name; for hence it came to pass that the knowledge of the covenant of the Lord
flourished afresh.

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joseph
returned</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Although Joseph and the rest had left
so many pledges in Egypt, that it would be necessary for them to return; it is
yet probable that they were rather drawn back thither by the oracle of God. For
God never permitted them to choose an abode at their own will; but as he had
before led Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in their journeying, so he held their sons
shut up in the land of Goshen, as within barriers. And there is no doubt that
the holy fathers left that oracle which we have in the fifteenth chapter and the
thirteenth verse,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;011513&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
15:13 to their sons, to be kept in faithful custody as a precious treasure. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">F674</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
They return, therefore, into Egypt, not only because they were compelled by
present necessity, but because it was not lawful for them to shake off with the
hand, the yoke which God had put upon their necks. But if the Lord does not hold
all men bound by voluntary obedience to himself, he nevertheless holds their
minds by his secret rein, that they may not withdraw themselves from his
government; nor can we form any other conjecture than that they were restrained
by his fear, so that even when admonished of the tyrannical oppression which was
coming upon them, they did not attempt to make their escape. We know that their
disposition was not so mild as to prevent them from rebelling against lighter
burdens. Wherefore, on this point, a special sense of religious obligation
subdued them, so that they prepared themselves quietly and silently to endure
the hardest servitude.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when, Joseph's brethren
saw that their father was dead</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Moses here
relates, that the sons of Jacob, after the death of their father, were
apprehensive lest Joseph should take vengeance for the injury they had done him.
And whence this fear, but because they form their judgment of him according to
their own disposition? That they had found him so placable they do not attribute
to true piety towards God, nor do they account it a special gift of the Spirit:
but rather, they imagine that, out of respect to his father alone, he had
hitherto been so far restrained, as barely to postpone his revenge. But, by such
perverse judgment, they do a great injury to one who, by the liberality of his
treatment, had borne them witness that his mind was free from all hatred and
malevolence. Part of the injurious surmise reflected even upon God, whose
special grace had shone forth in the moderation of Joseph. Hence, however, we
gather, that guilty consciences are so disturbed by blind and unreasonable
fears, that they stumble in broad day-light. Joseph had absolved his brethren
from the crime they had committed against him; but they are so agitated by
guilty compunctions, that they voluntarily become their own tormentors. And they
have not themselves to thank, that they did not bring down upon themselves the
very punishment which had been remitted; because the mind of Joseph might well
have been wounded by their distrust. For, what could they mean by still
malignantly suspecting him to whose compassion they had again and again owed
their lives? Yet I do not doubt, that long ago they had repented of their
wickedness, but, perhaps, because they had not yet been sufficiently purified,
the Lord suffered them to be tortured with anxiety and trouble: first, to make
them a proof to others, that an evil conscience is its own tormentor, and, then,
to humble them under a renewed sense of their own guilt; for, when they regard
themselves as obnoxious to their brother's judgment, they cannot forget, unless
they are worse than senseless, the celestial tribunal of God. What Solomon says,
we see daily fulfilled, that the wicked flee when no man pursueth;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;202801&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
28:1;) but, in this way, God compels the fugitives to give up their account.
They would desire, in their supine torpor, to deceive both God and men; and they
bring upon their minds, as far as they are able, the callousness of obstinacy:
in the mean time, whether they will or no, they are made to tremble at the sound
of a falling leaf, lest their carnal security should obliterate their sense of
the judgment of God.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;032636&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
26:36.) Nothing is more desirable than a tranquil mind. While God deprives the
wicked of this singular benefit, which is desired by all, he invites us to
cultivate integrity. But especially, seeing that the patriarchs, who were
already affected with penitence for their wickedness, are yet thus severely
awakened, a long time afterwards, let none of us yield to self-indulgence; but
let each diligently examine himself, lest hypocrisy should inwardly cherish the
secret stings of the wrath of God; and may that happy peace, which can find no
place in a double heart, shine within our thoroughly purified breasts. For this
due reward of their neglect remains for all those who do not draw nigh to God
sincerely and with all their heart, that they are compelled to stand before the
judgment-seat of mortal man. Wherefore, there is no other method which can free
us from disquietude, but that of returning into favor with God. Whosoever shall
despise this remedy, shall be afraid not only of man, but also of a shadow, or a
breath of wind.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they sent a
messenger</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Because they are ashamed themselves
to speak, they engage messengers of peace, in whom Joseph might have greater
confidence. But here also we perceive that they who have an accusing conscience
are destitute of counsel and of reason. For if Jacob had been solicitous on this
point, why did he not effect reconciliation between the son who was so obedient
unto himself, and his brethren? Besides, for what reason should they attempt to
do that through mediators, which they could do so much better in their own
persons? The Lord, therefore, suffers them to act like children; that we, being
instructed by their example, may look for no advantage from the use of frivolous
inventions. But it may be asked, where the sons of Jacob found men to whom they
could venture to commit such a message; for it was no light thing to make known
their execrable crime to strangers? And it would have been folly to subject
themselves to this infamy among the Egyptians. The most probable conjecture is,
that some domestic witnesses were chosen from the number of their own servants;
for though Moses makes no mention of such, when he relates that Jacob departed
into Egypt; yet that some were brought with him, may easily be gathered from
certain considerations.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Forgive, I pray thee
now</i></font><font face="Palatino">. They do not dissemble the fact that they
had grievously sinned; and they are so far from extenuating their fault, that
they freely heap up words in charging themselves with guilt. They do not,
therefore, ask that pardon should be granted them as if the offense were light:
but they place in opposition to the atrocity of their crime, first, the
authority of their father, and then the sacred name of God. Their confession
would have been worthy of commendation, had they proceeded directly, and without
tortuous contrivances, to appease their brother. Now, since they have drawn from
the fountain of piety the instruction that it is right for sin to be remitted to
the servants of God; we may receive it as a common exhortation, that if we have
been injured by the members of the Church, we must not be too rigid and
immovable in pardoning the offense. This humanity indeed is generally enjoined
upon us towards all men: but when the bond of religion is superadded, we are
harder than iron, if we are not inclined to the exercise of compassion. And we
must observe, that they expressly mention the God of Jacob: because the peculiar
faith and worship by which they were distinguished from the rest of the nations,
ought to unite them with each other in a closer bond: as if God, who had adopted
that family, stood forth in the midst of them as engaged to produce
reconciliation.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joseph
wept when they spake unto him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It cannot be
ascertained with certainty from the words of Moses, whether the brethren of
Joseph were present, and were speaking, at the time he wept. Some interpreters
imagine that a part was here acted designedly; so that when the mind of Joseph
had been sounded by others, the brethren, soon afterwards, came in, during the
discourse. I rather incline to a different opinion; namely, that, when he knew,
from the messengers, that their minds were tormented, and they were troubling
themselves in vain, he was moved with sympathy towards them. Then, having sent
for them, he set them free from all care and fear; and their speech, when they
themselves were deprecating his anger, drew forth his tears. Moreover, by thus
affectionately weeping over the sorrow and anxiety of his brethren, he affords
us a remarkable example of compassion. But if we have an arduous conflict with
the impetuosity of an angry temper, or the obstinacy of a disposition to hatred,
we must pray to the Lord for a spirit of meekness, the force of which manifests
itself not less effectually, at this day, in the members of Christ, than
formerly in Joseph.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Am I in the place of
God?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some think that, in these words, he was
rejecting the honor paid him: as if he would say, that it was unjustly offered
to him, because it was due to God alone. But this interpretation is destitute of
probability, since he often permitted himself to be addressed in this manner,
and knew that the minds of his brethren were utterly averse to transfer the
worship of God to mortal man. And I equally disapprove another meaning given to
the passage, which makes Joseph refuse to exact punishment, because he is not
God: for he does not restrain himself from retaliating the injury, in the hope
that God will prove his avenger. Others adduce a third signification; namely,
that the whole affair was conducted by the counsel of God, and not by his own:
which though I do not entirely reject, because it approaches the truth, yet I do
not embrace the interpretation as true. For the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tjt
</font><font face="Palatino">(<i>tachat</i>) sometimes signifies <i>instead
of</i>, sometimes it means <i>subjection</i>. Therefore if the note of
interrogation were not in the way, it might well be rendered, "Because I am
<i>under</i> God;" and then the sense would be, "Fear not, for I am under God;"
so that Joseph would teach them, that because he is subject to the authority of
God, it is not his business to lead the way, but to follow. But, whereas
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h
</font><font face="Palatino">(<i>he</i>,) the note of interrogation, is prefixed
to the word, it cannot be otherwise expounded than to mean that it would be
wrong for him, a mortal man, to presume to thwart the counsel of God. But as to
the sum of the matter, there is no ambiguity. For seeing that Joseph considers
the design of divine providence, he restrains his feelings as with a bridle,
lest they should carry him to excess. He was indeed of a mild and humane
disposition; but nothing is better or more suitable to assuage his anger, than
to submit himself to be governed by God. When, therefore, the desire of revenge
urges us, let all our feelings be subjected to the same authority. Moreover,
since he desires his brethren to be tranquil and secure, from the consideration,
that he, ascribing due honor to God, willingly submits to obey the Divine
command; let us learn, hence, that it is most to our advantage to deal with men
of moderation, who set God before them as their leader, and who not only submit
to his will, but also cheerfully obey him. For if any one is impotently carried
away by the lust of the flesh, we must fear a thousand deaths from him, unless
God should forcibly break his fury. Now as it is the one remedy for assuaging
our anger, to acknowledge what we ourselves are, and what right God has over us;
so, on the other hand, when this thought has taken full possession of our minds,
there is no ardor, however furious, which it will not suffice to
mitigate.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye thought evil against
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Joseph well considers (as we have said) the
providence of God; so that he imposes it on himself as a compulsory law, not
only to grant pardon, but also to exercise beneficence. And although we have
treated at large on this subject, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;014501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
45:1, yet it will be useful also to repeat something on it now. In the first
place, we must notice this difference in his language: for whereas, in the
former passage, Joseph, desiring to soothe the grief, and to alleviate the fear
of his brethren, would cover their wickedness by every means which ingenuity
could suggest; he now corrects them a little more openly and freely; perhaps
because he is offended with their disingenousness. Yet he holds to the same
principle as before. Seeing that, by the secret counsel of God, he was led into
Egypt, for the purpose of preserving the life of his brethren, he must devote
himself to this object, lest he should resist God. He says, in fact, by his
action, "Since God has deposited your life with me, I should be engaged in war
against him, if I were not to be the faithful dispenser of the grace which he
had committed to my hands." Meanwhile, he skillfully distinguishes between the
wicked counsels of men, and the admirable justice of God, by so ascribing the
government of all things to God, as to preserve the divine administration free
from contracting any stain from the vices of men. The selling of Joseph was a
crime detestable for its cruelty and perfidy; yet he was not sold except by the
decree of heaven. For neither did God merely remain at rest, and by conniving
for a time, let loose the reins of human malice, in order that afterwards he
might make use of this occasion; but, at his own will, he appointed the order of
acting which he intended to be fixed and certain. Thus we may say with truth and
propriety, that Joseph was sold by the wicked consent of his brethren, and by
the secret providence of God. Yet it was not a work common to both, in such a
sense that God sanctioned anything connected with or relating to their wicked
cupidity: because while they are contriving the destruction of their brother,
God is effecting their deliverance from on high. Whence also we conclude, that
there are various methods of governing the world. This truly must be generally
agreed, that nothing is done without his will; because he both governs the
counsels of men, and sways their wills and turns their efforts at his pleasure,
and regulates all events: but if men undertake anything right and just, he so
actuates and moves them inwardly by his Spirit, that whatever is good in them,
may justly be said to be received from him: but if Satan and ungodly men rage,
he acts by their hands in such an inexpressible manner, that the wickedness of
the deed belongs to them, and the blame of it is imputed to them. For they are
not induced to sin, as the faithful are to act aright, by the impulse of the
Spirit, but they are the authors of their own evil, and follow Satan as their
leader. Thus we see that the justice of God shines brightly in the midst of the
darkness of our iniquity. For as God is never without a just cause for his
actions, so men are held in the chains of guilt by their own perverse will. When
we hear that God frustrates the wicked expectations, and the injurious desires
of men, we derive hence no common consolation. Let the impious busy themselves
as they please, let them rage, let them mingle heaven and earth; yet they shall
gain nothing by their ardor; and not only shall their impetuosity prove
ineffectual, but shall be turned to an issue the reverse of that which they
intended, so that they shall promote our salvation, though they do it
reluctantly. So that whatever poison Satan produces, God turns it into medicine
for his elect. And although in this place God is said to have "meant it unto
good," because contrary to expectation, he had educed a joyful issue out of
beginnings fraught with death: yet, with perfect rectitude and justice, he turns
the food of reprobates into poison, their light into darkness, their table into
a snare, and, in short, their life into death. If human minds cannot reach these
depths, let them rather suppliantly adore the mysteries they do not comprehend,
than, as vessels of clay, proudly exalt themselves against their
Maker.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To save much people
alive</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Joseph renders his office subservient to
the design of God's providence; and this sobriety is always to be cultivated,
that every one may behold, by faith, God from on high holding the helm of the
government of the world, and may keep himself within the bounds of his vocation;
and even, being admonished by the secret judgments of God, may descend into
himself, and exhort himself to the discharge of his duty: and if the reason of
this does not immediately appear, we must still take care that we do not fly in
confused and erratic circuits, as fanatical men are wont to do. What Joseph says
respecting his being divinely chosen "to save much people alive," some extend to
the Egyptians. Without condemning such an extension, I would rather restrict the
application of the words to the family of Jacob; for Joseph amplifies the
goodness of God by this circumstance, that the seed of the Church would be
rescued from destruction by his labor. And truly, from these few men, whose seed
would otherwise have been extinct before their descendants had been multiplied,
that vast multitude sprang into being, which God soon afterwards raised
up.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will nourish
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It was a token of a solid and not a
feigned reconciliation, not only to abstain from malice and injury, but also to
"overcome evil with good," as Paul teaches,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">&lt;451221&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
12:21:) and truly, he who fails in his duty, when he possesses the power of
giving help, and when the occasion demands his assistance, shows, by this very
course, that he is not forgetful of injury. This requires to be the more
diligently observed, because, commonly, the greater part weakly conclude that
they forgive offenses if they do not retaliate them; as if indeed we were not
taking revenge when we withdraw our hands from giving help. You would assist
your brother if you thought him worthy: he implores your aid in necessity; you
desert him because he has done you some unkindness; what hinders you from
helping him but hatred? Therefore, we shall then only prove our minds to be free
from malevolence, when we follow with kindness those enemies by whom we have
been ill treated. Joseph is said to have spoken "to the heart of his brethren,"
because, by addressing them with suavity and kindness, he removed all their
scruples; as we have before seen, that Shechem spoke to the heart of Dinah, when
he attempted to console her with allurements, in order that, forgetting the
dishonor he had done her, she might consent to marry
him.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joseph dwelt in
Egypt</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is not without reason that Moses
relates how long Joseph lived, because the length of the time shows the more
clearly his unfailing constancy: for although he is raised to great honor and
power among she Egyptians, he still is closely united with his father's house.
Hence it is easy to conjecture, that he gradually took his leave of the
treasures of the court, because he thought there was nothing better for him to
do than to hold them in contempt, lest earthly dignity should separate him from
the kingdom of God. He had before spurned all the allurements which might have
occupied his mind in Egypt: he now counts it necessary to proceed further, that,
laying aside his honor, he may descend to an ignoble condition, and wean his own
sons from the hope of succeeding to his worldly rank. We know how anxiously
others labor, both that they themselves may not be reduced in circumstances, and
that they may leave their fortune entire to their posterity: but Joseph, during
sixty years, employed all his efforts to bring himself and his children into a
state of submission, lest his earthly greatness should alienate them from the
little flock of the Lord. In short, he imitated the serpents, who cast off their
<i>exuviae</i>, that, being stripped of their old age, they may gather new
strength. He sees the children of his own grandchildren; why does not his
solicitude to provide for them increase, as his children increase? Yet he has so
little regard for worldly rank or opulence, that he would rather see them
devoted to a pastoral life, and be despised by the Egyptians, if only they might
be reckoned in the family of Israel. Besides, in a numerous offspring during his
own life, the Lord afforded him some taste of his benediction, from which he
might conceive the hope of future deliverance: for, among so many temptations,
it was necessary for him to be encouraged and sustained, lest he should sink
under them.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Joseph said unto his
brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is uncertain whether Joseph died
the first or the last of the brethren, or whether a part of them survived him.
Here indeed Moses includes, under the name of brethren, not only those who were
really so, but other relations. I think, however, that certain of the chiefs of
each family were called at his command, from whom the whole of the people might
receive information: and although it is probable that the other patriarchs also
gave the same command respecting themselves, since the bones of them all were,
in like manner, conveyed into the land of Canaan; yet special mention is made of
Joseph alone, for two reasons. First, since the eyes of them all were fixed upon
him, on account of his high authority, it was his duty to lead their way, and
cautiously to beware lest the splendor of his dignity should cast a stumbling
block before any of them. Secondly, it was of great consequence, as an example,
that it should be known to all the people, that he who held the second place in
the kingdom of Egypt, regardless of so great an honor, was contented with his
own coalition, which was only that of the heir of a bare
promise.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
die</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This expression has the force of a command
to his brethren to be of good courage after his death, because the truth of God
is immortal; for he does not wish them to depend upon his life or that of
another man, so as to cause them to prescribe a limit to the power of God; but
he would have them patiently to rest till the suitable time should arrive. But
whence had he this great certainty, that he should be a witness and a surety of
future redemption, except from his having been so taught by his father? For we
do not read that God had appeared unto him, or that an oracle had been brought
to him by an angel from heaven; but because he was certainly persuaded that
Jacob was a divinely appointed teacher and prophet, who should transmit to his
sons the covenant of salvation deposited with him; Joseph relies upon his
testimony not less securely than if some vision had been presented to him, or he
had seen angels descending to him from heaven: for unless the hearing of the
word is sufficient for our faith, we deserve not that God, whom we then defraud
of his honor, should condescend to deal with us: not that faith relies on human
authority, but because it hears God speaking through the mouth of men, and by
their external voice is drawn upwards; for what God pronounces through men, he
seals on our hearts by his Spirit. Thus faith is built on no other foundation
than God himself; and yet the preaching of men is not wanting in its claim of
authority and reverence. This restraint is put upon the rash curiosity of those
men, who, eagerly desiring visions, despise the ordinary ministry of the Church;
as if it were absurd that God, who formerly showed himself to the fathers out of
heaven, should send forth his voice out of the earth. But if they would reflect
how gloriously he once descended to us in the person of his only-begotten Son,
they would not so importunately desire that heaven should daily be opened unto
them. But, not to insist upon these things; when the brethren saw that Joseph,

prescribed to God in what way his prayer should be answered.  He might, however,
be acting under a divine impulse, and the context would lead to such an
inference.  But if it was a weakness in this good man to be thus minute in his
stipulations, it was one which God neither reproved  nor condemned; and
therefore it seems harsh to give it the name of divination.  Calvin's object,

Some suppose that by the ear-rings is meant an ornament for the face or
forehead, as appears in the margin of our version, and as Calvin here seems to
intimate.  But the increased knowledge of Eastern customs which recent times
have furnished, has given weight to the opinion of older commentators, that a
nose-jewel is here intended.  This ornament was not suspended from the central
cartilaginous substance of the nose, but from one side, which was bored for the
purpose.  Calvin's interpretation, that the weight of this ornament was the half
of ten shekels, instead of half a shekel, cannot be admitted.  Though, according
to its weight, it might not be worth more than ten or twelve shillings; yet its
workmanship might be costly; and if it contained some precious stone, which is
not improbable, it might be of very great value.  There can be no doubt that the
presents generally were exceedingly valuable. &#8212;

It was the custom of the ancients on occasions of this kind first to take their
meal together, and when the wants of nature had been supplied, and the spirit
had been exhilarated, to open the subject of communication; but Abraham's
servant purposely reverses this order, to show his earnestness in attending to
his master's business; and perhaps also his confidence of success, in
consequence of the favorable indications which God had given in answer to his
prayers.  See Dathe and Le Clerc. &#8212;

On the question, whether Abraham married Keturah during Sarah's life, or not
till after her death, authorities are much divided.  Whichever side is taken the
difficulties are great, yet perhaps on neither side insuperable.  So far as
merely human probabilities are concerned, the evidence would turn in favor of
Calvin's hypothesis, which is supported by Dr. A. Clarke and Professor Bush; the
arguments of the latter writer, which seem to be mainly drawn from Calvin, are
very forcibly put.  On the other hand, great consideration is due to the
authority of such men as Patrick, Le Clerc, Kidder, and Scott, who would
preserve the present order of the sacred narrative; and would account for the
events related on the ground of a miraculous renewal and continuance of
strength, which Calvin himself allows to have taken place.  It is in favor of
this latter mode of interpretation, that it certainly better accords with the
general character of Abraham, and is more consistent with the testimony which
the Scriptures bear to his faith, than the other hypothesis; besides which the
order of the narrative remains undisturbed.  See this question treated at length
in Exercitationes Andreae Riveti in Genesin, p 548.  Lugd. 1633. &#8212;

It is to be remembered that the birthright included not merely earthly

This is a dangerous position, however it may be modified or explained.  True
faith never leads to sin.  It was the mixture, not to say the predominance of
unbelief, which caused Rebekah, instead of waiting for the fulfillment of God's
promises in his own way, to plot and to execute a scheme of imposture, which
involved herself and her family in perpetual disquietude.  What Calvin calls

There is a great want of Calvin's accustomed caution and soundness in all this
reasoning.  It certainly was right that Jacob should feel and express the fear,
lest the deception which his mother required him to practice should be detected,
and should bring a curse upon him and not a blessing.  It would indeed have been
a still higher proof of integrity, and a still stronger exercise of faith, had
he repelled the importunities of his mother, saying, "How shall I do this
wickedness, and sin against God?" &#8212;

Amsterdam and Berlin editions both have the word patris and not matris, the
translation above given seems to be required.  It agrees substantially with the

It is much more probable that Jacob was influenced by a precipitate and

he paused for a moment at the apprehension of consequences, should his mother's
scheme fail, yet he too readily acquiesced, and exposed himself to subsequent
dangers, not from a supreme regard to the will of God, but from that self-love

The Council of Trent is here obviously referred to, which held its sessions from
the year 1545 to the year 1563.  This council was the Romanist reaction upon the
Protestant reformation.  Father Paul gives a singular and graphic description of
the persons, the characters, and the arguments, by which this last council of
the Church of Rome was distinguished.  It will be remembered that Calvin's
Commentary on Genesis was published about the middle of this protracted period.

Camarina was a city on the south of Sicily, placed near the mouths of two
rivers, close to which was a march or lake, called the Camarine lake, injurious
to health, and often producing pestilence.  It is reported that the inhabitants
consulted Apollo whether or not  they should drain it.  The answer was, that it
would be better undrained.  This answer they disregarded, and in consequence the
enemy found it easy to attack and plunder the city.  Hence the proverb, "Ne
moveas Camarinam;" that is, "Do not get rid of one evil to bring on you a
greater." &#8212;

Whatever force and truth, as well as beauty, there may be in the exposition of
Calvin which follows, he appears to have dismissed too hastily the opinion of
the Jews, that the vision was symbolical of Divine Providence.  The
circumstances of Jacob seemed to require some such intimations of Divine
protection and care during his journey, as this interpretation of the vision
presents.  And in every way the passage thus understood is both useful and
encouraging.  There is, however, no need to question, that the higher mystical
interpretation, on which Calvin exclusively insists, is the legitimately
applicable, as conveying the ultimate and, in short, the most important meaning
of the vision.  The reader may consult the 123d Exercitation of Rivetus on this
subject. &#8212; Rivetus in Gen., p.

Perhaps undue severity of language is here used respecting Laban; for we find it

Rivetus judiciously observes on this passage: "There are those who think that by
this ceremony Jacob worshipped God; but by what argument they prove this I do
not see; for whatever precedes or follows indicates that he wished to show
reverence to his brother; and for this reason, he went before his family; so
also the handmaidens and their sons bowed themselves; likewise Leah and her
sons, and lastly, Rachel with Joesph; in each case the same word is used, which
the Vulgate renders 'adored.'  This verse also proves the same thing; for after
he saw his brother approaching, he bowed seven times, till his brother drew
near..... This, therefore, was civil reverence, (reverentia civillis,) which did
not derogate from the spiritual right and prerogative of the covenant entered
into with Jehovah."  This account seems much more probable than that given by
Calvin. &#8212;
Ed.</font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">FT567</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Peter Martyr inclines to the opinion of Calvin, though he expresses himself with
greater caution.  There appears no reason to doubt that Jacob said what he
meant.  It is tru he might have other reasons besides those he gave, for not
accompanying his brother; reasons sufficient to deter a pious mind from too
close and frequent intercourse with persons uninfluenced by true religion.  But
it is by no means certain that Jacob did not go to Seir; though he would
probably go unaccompanied by his wives and children, his flocks and herds.  The

that the word

(Shalem,) which our translators, with Calvin, regarded as a proper name, means
also "peace," or "safety;" and therefore the 18th verse may be read "Jacob came
in safety to the city of Sichem."  And this is the translation given in Calvin's
own version, Et venit Iahacob incolumis in civitatem Sechem.  Thus his own text

lambs; the probability, however, is, that the coin itself was called a lamb, as
we have a coin called a sovereign.  It is supposed that the coin bore the image
of a lamb, perhaps because it was the conventional price at which lambs were
generally valued.  The testimony of St. Stephen

reason given for Calvin's translation of the word

It appears, from a calculation of the ages of Rebekah, of Jacob, and of Rachel,
that Deborah must, at this time, have lived far beyond the common term of human

she could not be less than twenty at the time of her marriage; it will follow
that she bore twins in, or after, the fortieth year of her age.  If these forty
years be added to the one hundred and seven of Jacob's life, this will make one
hundred and forty-seven.  Supposing Deborah to have been twenty-five when she

The second verse is rendered by Professor Bush in a manner different from that
of any other commentator whom the Editor has had the opportunity of consulting. 
His view of the passage is, at least, worthy of consideration. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">"</font></sup><font face="Palatino">The
correct translation," he says, "is doubtless the following:  'Joseph, being
seventeen years old, was tending his brethren among the flocks, and he a (mere)
lad, (even) the sons of Bilhah, etc.'  The mention of his youth is brought in
parenthetically, as something peculiarly worthy of notice; while the clause,
'the sons of Bilhah, etc.,' is designed to limit and specify the term 'brethren'
going before."  This interpretation he proceeds to vindicate by reference to
passages of similar construction, which we have not room to quote.  The point
which it would establish is, that Jacob assigned to his boy, of seventeen years
of age, the superintendence or oversight of the sons of Bilhah among the flocks;
so that he was rather an overlooker of the shepherds than of the sheep.  This
would show more clearly the propriety of Joseph's conduct, in carrying an ill
report of his brethren to their father; and would also account for the hostility
they felt towards him.  But it may be doubted whether this interpretation can
stand. &#8212;
Ed.</font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">FT586</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
"Son of his old age."  The Chaldee renders it, "a wise son;" as if he were a man
in intellect, while a boy in years.  This would avoid a difficulty; for Benjamin
was far more properly the son of Jacob's old age than Joseph. &#8212;

The coat of many colors was supposed by some to be the garment belonging of
right to the first-born; consequently, Reuben would be entitled to it, till he
forfeited it by his misconduct.  Jacob, therefore, is understood to have
transferred this coat, together with the rank of primogeniture, from Reuben to
the eldest son of Rachel, his most beloved wife.  If this were so, it would make
the conduct of Reuben, on this occasion, still more generous than it appears on
the ordinary supposition.  There is, however, this objection to such an
interpretation, that Jacob is said to have made it for Joseph, (see ver. 3,) and
not merely to have given it to him. &#8212; Ed.

Perhaps, however, the passage may be better explained by supposing the caravan
which was passing, to be made up of Ishmaelites and Midianites.  The Ishmaelites

"How great the corruption of manners with reference to the marriage relation was
among the Egyptians, appears from Herodotus, whose account Larcher has compared
with the one under consideration.  The wife of one of the oldest kings was
untrue to him.  It was long before a woman could be found who was faithful to
her husband; and when one was, at last, found, the king took her without
hesitation to himself.  From such a state of morals the Biblical narrative can
easily be conceived to be natural.  The evidence of the monuments is also not
very favorable to the Egyptian women.  Thus they are represented as addicted to
excess in drinking wine, as even becoming so much intoxicated, as to be unable
to stand or walk alone, or to carry their liquor discreetly."" &#8212; Egypt and

That the word

(cohen) generally signifies priest, is not to be disputed.  Gesenius earnestly
contends that this is its invariable meaning; but to establish his point, he is
obliged to regard some as priests who were not of the tribe of Levi.  This seems
conclusive against him; for there is no room for doubt that none were, or could
be, priests who sprang from any other tribe.  Yet so much, perhaps, ought to be
conceded to the primary meaning of the work, that is should be translated
priest, wherever the sense of the passage does not require another
interpretation.  Such a rule would determine its meaning in this passage.  The
following remarks of Hengstenberg deserve attention.

41:45, Pharaoh gives to Joseph, Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, the priest
of On, in marriage.  This name (which means he who belongs to the sun) is very
common on the Egyptian monuments, and is especially appropriate for the Priest
of On, or Heliopolis (the city of the sun).  Since Pharaoh evidently intended,
by this act, to establish the power bestowed on Joseph upon a firm basis, it is
implied in this account; first, that Egyptian High Priests occupied a very
important position; and, secondly, that among them the High Priest of On was the
most distinguished.  Both these points are confirmed by history." &#8212; See

There is, however, another interpretation of the passage which is worthy of
attention.  In our version, the words are, "If I am bereaved of my children, I
am bereaved;" but the expression, of my children, is not in the original.  The
close translation is simply, "If I be bereaved, I am bereaved."  And this may be
the language of entire resignation to the will of God.  Jacob had had a severe
struggle in his mind, before he could give up his beloved Benjamin:  But having
at length succeeded, he seems now freely to surrender himself and his family to
the divine will.

"At the entertainment to which Joseph invited his brethren, they sat apart from
the Egyptians, while Joseph was again separated from both.  The author [Moses}

bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.' Herodotus
also remarks, that the Egyptians abstained from all familiar intercourse with
foreigners, since these were unclean to them, especially because they slew and
ate the animals which were sacred among the Egyptians.  The circumstance that
Joseph eats separately from the other Egyptians is strictly in accordance with
the great difference of rank, and the spirit of caste, which prevailed among the
Egyptians." &#8212; Egypt and the Books of Moses, p. 39. &#8212;

"Jamblichus, in his book on Egyptian mysteries, mentions the practice of

extremity of Egypt, or rather in Nubia, were they were able to deliver
themselves from a perilous condition, only through great presence of mind, they

answered them, 'I know what sort of people you are.  I have consulted my cup,

The division of chapters in this place is singularly unhappy.  It interrupts one
of the most touching scenes recorded in the sacred volume, just in the middle. 
It separates the irrestible appeal of Judah to the feelings of Joseph from its
immediate and happy effect.  In the Hebrew Bible, the section commences with
Judah's address, and no break is made where this chapter commences; so that the

"A remarkable parallel to the description of the arrival of Jacob's family in
Egypt, is furnished by a scene in a tomb at Beni Hassan, representing strangers
who arrive in Egypt.  They carry their goods with them upon asses.  The first
figure is an Egyptian scribe, who presents an account of their arrival to a
person in a sitting posture, one of the principal officers of the reigning
Pharaoh &#8212; (compare the phrase, princes of Pharaoh, ver. 15.)  The next,
likewise an Egyptian, ushers them into his presence, and two of the strangers
advance, bringing presents, the wild goat and the gazelle, probably as
production of their country.  Four men with bows and clubs follow, leading an
ass, on which are two children in panniers, accompanied by a boy and four women.

The following passage from Sir J. G. Wilkinson's Manners and Customs of the
Ancient Egyptians, will be read with interest.  The priests "enjoyed important
privileges, which extended to their whole family.  They were exempt from taxes;
they consumed no part of their own income in any of their necessary expenses;
and they had one of the three portions into which the land of Egypt was divided,
free from all duties.  They were provided for, from the public stores, out of
which they received a stated allowance of corn, and all the other necessaries of
life; and we find that when Pharaoh, by the advice of Joseph, took all the land
of the Egyptians in lieu of corn, the priests were not obliged to make the same
sacrifice of their landed property, nor was the tax of the fifth part entailed
upon it, as on that of other people." &#8212; Vol. 1:p. 262 &#8212;

The reasoning of Calvin, besides being in every respect unsatisfactory, is
founded on a misquotation of the original.  He appears to have put down the
words from memory, or else his transcriber has made the mistake for him.  The
only difference between the words rendered "a bed" and a "staff" lies  in the
Masoretic punctuation; of which, it is well known, the authority is disputed. 
Perhaps one of the strongest arguments on the side of those opposed to the
points, is derived from this passage and the Apostle's interpretation of it.  If
the word is not pointed, then it may mean either a bed or a staff; if, on the
other hand, the present points are of equal authority with the text, the Apostle
has quoted it wrong.  The latter supposition is not to be endured.  It seems to
follow, then, that the original was either not pointed, or the copy used by St.
Paul was pointed differently from the present text, or he knew that the points
were not to be relied upon, for giving the precise meaning of the Holy Spirit in
the word. &#8212; Ed.

(yedegu,) Ainsworth translates the passage, "let them increase like fish into a
multitude."  The Hebrew word for fish is from the above root, because of their
prolific property; and consequently the use of such a term naturally suggests
the notion of an extraordinary increase.  Thus the Chaldee paraphrase adds,
"like the fishes of the sea."  Hence, in the time of Moses there were 85,200 men
of war descended from Joseph, a greater number than from any other of Jacob's

Perhaps this interpretation of a confessedly obscure passage, will be deemed
rather ingenious than solid.  It is supposed by many, that Jacob refers to some
transaction of which no record is preserved.  He may, like Abraham, on some
occasion, have armed his household to recover from the hands of the Amorites the
field of Sheehem, which he had previously purchased.  But the whole must be left
in hopeless obscurity.  Ainsworth thinks that Jacob is speaking proleptically,
and representing the future conduct of his children under Joshua, whose sword
and bow he here calls his own.  But this seems far-fetched.  The Chaldee
interpretation, that the sword and bow are figuratively used for prayer and
supplication, is still more improbable. &#8212;

The reader will observe, that the entire structure of these predictions is
poetical.  The prophecies of the Old Testament are generally delivered in this
form; and God has thus chosen the most natural method of conveying prophetic
intelligence, through the medium of that elevated strain of diction, which
suggests itself to imaginative minds, which is peculiarly fitted to deal with
sublime and invisible realities, and which best serves to stir up animated
feelings, and to fix important truths in the memory of the reader.  They who
wish to examine more minutely the poetical character of the chapter, are
referred to Dr. Adam Clarke's Commentary, and to Caunter's Poetry of the
Pentateuch.  A few observations, in passing, will be made in the notes to such
passages as derive elucidation from their poetical structure. &#8212;

The literal translation of Calvin's version is, "Thy velocity was like that of
water, thou shalt not excel: because thou wentest up into thy father's couch,
then thou pollutedst my bed, he has vanished."  This gives the patriarch's
expression a different turn from that supposed by our translators; who
understand the last word in the sentence to be a repetition of what had been
said before, only putting it in the third person, as expressive of indignation;
as if he had turned round from Reuben to his other children and said &#8212;
"Yes, I declare he went up into my bed!"  Another view is given in the margin of
our Bible, "My couch is gone;" which means that, by this defilement, the
marriage bond was broken.  To this version Calvin objects at the close of the
paragraph.  But both these constructions seem forced.  Calvin's appears the most
natural.  He represents Reuben as having lost all, by his criminal conduct. 
Honour, excellence, priority, virtue, and consequently character and influence,
had all gone up as the dew from the face of the earth, and had vanished away.

Libido is not the word used in Calvin's version, though his commentary proceeds

The marginal reading of our Bible for "they digged down a wall," is "they

"ox," and not "wall," regard the word ox as a metaphorical term for a brave and
powerful man.  Thus Herder, in Caunter's Poetry of the Pentateuch, gives the

welp.</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>From the prey,
my son, thou art gone
up</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>He stoopeth down,
he coucheth as a
lion,</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>And as a
lioness; who shall rouse him?"</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is to be observed that three different words are
here used in the original to express the metaphor, which illustrates the
character of the tribe of Judah.  First,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rwg</font><font face="Palatino">,
(gur) the lion's cub; secondly,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hyra</font><font face="Palatino">,
(aryah,) the full-grown lion; and thirdly,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">aybl</font><font face="Palatino">,
(labi,) the old lioness.  These different terms are supposed to represent the
tribe of Judah in its earliest period, in the age of David, and in subsequent
times.</font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">FT658</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Calvin seems to assent to this interpretation, which is by no means generally
accepted.  Gesenius renders
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hly&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
tranquillity &#8212; "until tranquillity shall come;" but the more approved
rendering is "the Peaceable One," or "the Pacifier."  He who made peace for us,
by the sacrifice of Himself. &#8212;
Ed.</font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">FT659</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Scribam recessurum negat ex pedibus. But in the text, Calvin uses the word
Legislator; the French version translates ir Legislateur; and the English
translation is lawgiver. It is evident that Calvin had a reason for using the
term Scribe; for the orignal
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qqjm</font><font face="Palatino">,
(mechokaik,) rather means a scribe or lawyer, than a lawgiver; and rather
describes one who aids in the administration of laws, than one who frames them.
In this sense, he supposes, and probably with truth, that the term is here
applied. The expression "from between his feet," has been the subject of much
criticism; but perhaps no view of it is so satisfactory as that maintained by
Calvin. &#8212;
Ed.</font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">FT660</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Quia nihil hoc cavilla proficiunt Judaei, ad figmentum venturi sui Messiae
trahentes vetustum regni excidium.  Literally translated, the sense of the
passage would not be obvious to the English reader.  It is hoped that the true
meaning of the passage is given above.  The original, however, is given, that
the learned reader may form his own judgment.  It is well known that modern Jews
regard their present depression as a proof that the Messiah has not yet come,
and therefore they draw out (trahentes) or postpone the execution of God's
threatened judgments, which we regard as having taken place under Titus and the
Romans, to a period still future.  This seems to be Calvin's meaning. &#8212;
Ed.</font><br><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">FT661</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
On this passage, which has given so much trouble to commentators, and which
Calvin has considered as such length, it may be observed, that the term rendered
scepter means also rod, and sometimes is translated tribe; perhaps because each
of the twelve tribes had its rod laid up in the tabernacle and temple.  Hence it
may be inferred that the expression, "The scepter shall not depart from Judah,"
means that Judah alone should continue in its integrity, as a tribe, till the
coming of the Messiah.  This renders it unnecessary to attempt any proof of th
eretention of regal power and authority in the tribe.  See Ainsworth and Bush in
loc.  The reader may also refer to an elaborate investigation of the subject in
Rivetus, Exercitations 178 and 179. &#8212;

See Numbers 2, where the order of the tribes in their encampment is given. 
Judah had the standard for the three tribes on the east, Reuben for the three
tribes on the south, Ephriam for the three tribes on the west, and Dan for the
remaining three tribes on the north of the tabernacle. &#8212;

The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wpyp&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
(sheppiphon,) translated "adder," occurs only in this place.  It is supposed by
Bochart to be the cerastes, "a serpent so called," says Calmet, "because it has
horns on its forehead."  Dr. A. Clarke gives this translation: </font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>"Dan shall be a
serpent on the way,</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>A

Jewish commentators suppose the patriarch's exclamation to have been suggested
in this place, by a prospective view of the temporal deliverances wrought for
Israel, by warriors of the tribe of Daniel So the Chaldee Paraphrast represents
him as saying, "I look not for the salvation of Gideon, because it is a temporal
salvation; nor for the salvation of Sampson the son of Manoah, because it is
transitory; but I look for the redemption of Christ the Son of David, who is to
come to call to himself the children, whose salvation my soul desireth."  See
Bush and Dr. A. Clarke.  Yet there is something affecting in the thought, that
the exclamation might be a sudden burst of holy desire for the immediate
fruition of the glory which the dying patriarch now saw so near at hand. &#8212;

As the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlya</font><font face="Palatino">,
rendered hind, sometimes means a tree, it is supposed by some, that it should be
so translated here.  Bochart suggests this translation:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>"Naphtali is a
spreading
oak,</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>Producing
beautiful branches."</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Dr. A. Clarke strenuously defends this version, and
says, "perhaps no man who understands the genius of the Hebrew language will
attempt to dispute its propriety."  Yet perhaps the received translation is not
to be so easily disposed of.  It may be granted that Bochart's figure is more
beautiful; but it will be difficult to show that his translation is equally
literal and correct.  Caunter suggests another rendering: </font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>"Naphtali is a deer
roaming at
liberty,</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>He shooteth
forth noble branches," &#8212; or antlers. &#8212; Ed.</i></b></font><br></div>

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" size="2" color="Maroon">"</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Filium
decoris."  The original is </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">trp

(Banoth,) literally, "the daughters went over the wall."  But Calvin, with our

branches, (which are the daughters of the tree,) according to a very usual
phraseology of the Hebrew Scriptures. &#8212;

Calvin, in his criticism on Joseph's conduct with reference to his father's
funeral, seems to bear hard upon the motives of the patriarch.  As there is
nothing in Joseph's previous history which is derogatory either to his moral
courage or his integrity, it is scarcely justifiable to impute a want of
firmness and of straightforwardness to him on this occasion.  Is not the
concluding portion of Calvin's remarks a sufficient answer to all that has gone
before?  And may we not conclude, that the whole of the circumstances of Jacob's
funeral were divinely ordered to perpetuate his memory? &#8212;
