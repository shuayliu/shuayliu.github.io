I"û<p>Here introduce an ionic liquid query tool, one of Jonah Liuâ€™s academic tool kits.</p>

<p>I wrote it by C++ with Qt5 library. As the Qt5 EUAL required, the source codes are opened and uploaded to GitHub. You can use it/change it freely under LGPLv3.0.</p>

<p>You can find the original codes through <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mainpage -&gt;(upright)projects -&gt;ILQuery</code> or directly from <a href="https://github.com/lsforusual/ILquery">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="howto-use">HOWTO USE</h2>

<p>Just open the software -&gt; type the cation abbreviation &amp; inion abbreviation (I <strong>STRONGLY RECOMMEND</strong> selecting the auto completer to finish ionâ€™s abbreviation)-&gt; click <em>query</em> button.</p>

<h2 id="todo">TODO</h2>

<p>An un-completed API service was established on https://api.jonahliu.ga/. One can use GET method like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://api.jonahliu.ga/?s=ILinfo.basic&amp;cid=c01001&amp;aid=a01001</code> obtaining a JSON-typed basic information. It is just the same as this software does.</p>

<p><strong>BUT</strong> the problem is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cid</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aid</code> are not easy to get through name or abbreviation.</p>

<p>I am bored to solve this in recent time.</p>

<h2 id="if-you-are-an-expert">IF YOU ARE AN EXPERT</h2>

<p>You can find the original database-<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ildb.db</code> in the source codes. It is a SQLite3 database, without additional encryption. You can get more detailed data about IL.</p>

<p>Any problem or suggestion while using the software, please do not hesitate to email me. â€“you can also find the email address at the <a href="https://jonahliu.cf">mainpage</a>.</p>
